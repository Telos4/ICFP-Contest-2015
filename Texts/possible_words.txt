First, thank you, one and all, for your tremendous bravery and cool-headedness last night. Our missions have become more challenging and more frequent with each passing year. Practical advances, such as CPU speeds, desktop parallelism, inexpensive large memory sizes, and commodity cloud computing mean that more and more researchers and hobbyists are encroaching on dangerous territory. In the past, we only needed to worry about a handful of top complexity theorists and programming language researchers, but today any sharp kid with an Athlon can accidentally summon a hellbeast.

We need more sharp, brave souls with expertise in several areas, particularly cryptography, program reasoning, algorithms, and programming languages, to keep the world safe from the Old Ones and their minions.

A sign in the shot revealed that it was recorded at the Classic Tetris World Championship at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo in early 2015.
Now is the time to introduce a new Tetris-like game that directly connects to the multidimensional hexagonal foundations of power phrases, or what we call 'davar' .
