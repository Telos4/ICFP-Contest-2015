   i oceanus

   sometimes i stand upon the shore
   where ocean vaults their effluence pour
   and troubled waters sigh and shriek
   of secrets that they dare not speak
   from nameless valleys far below
   and hills and plains no man may know
   the mystic swells and sullen surges
   hint like accursed thaumaturges
   a thousand horrors big with awe
   that forgotten ages saw
   o salt salt winds that bleakly sweep
   across the barren heaving deep;
   o wild wan waves that call to mind
   the chaos earth hath left behind;
   of you i ask one thing alone
   leave leave your ancient lore unknown!

   ii clouds

   of late i climbd a lonely height
   and watchd the moonstreakd clouds in flight
   whose forms fantastic reeld and whirld
   like genii of a spectral world
   thin cirri veild the silvry dome
   and waverd like the ocean foam
   while shapes of darker heavier kind
   scudded before a daemon wind
   methought the churning vapours took
   now and anon a fearsome look
   as if amidst the fog and blur
   marchd figures known and sinister
   from west to east the things advancd
   a mocking train that leapd and dancd
   like bacchanals with joined hands
   in endless file thro airy lands
   aerial muttrings dimly heard
   the comfort of my spirit stirrd
   with hideous thoughts that bade me screen
   my sight form the portentous scene
   yon fleeing mists the murmurs said
   are ghosts of hopes denyd and dead

   iii mother earth

   one night i wanderd down the bank
   of a deep valley hushd and dank
   whose stagnant air possessd a taint
   and chill that made me sick and faint
   the frequent trees on evry hand
   loomd like a ghastly goblin band
   and branches `gainst the narrowing sky
   took shapes i feardi knew not why
   deeper i plungd and seemd to grope
   for some lost thing as joy or hope
   yet found for all my searchings there
   naught save the phantoms of despair
   the walls contracted as i went
   still farther in my mad descent
   till soon of moon and stars bereft
   i crouchd within a rocky cleft
   so deep and ancient that the stone
   breathd things primordial and unknown
   my hands exploring strove to trace
   the features of the valleys face
   when midst the gloom they seemd to find
   an outline frightful to my mind
   not any shape my straining eyes
   could they have seen might recognize;
   for what i touchd bespoke a day
   too old for mans fugacious sway
   the clinging lichens moist and hoary
   forbade me read the antique story;
   but hidden water trickling low
   whisperd the tales i should not know

   mortal ephemeral and bold
   in mercy keep what i have told
   yet think sometimes of what hath been
   and sights these crumbling rocks have seen;
   of sentience old ere thy weak brook
   appeard in lesser magnitude
   and living things that yet servive
   tho not to human ken alive
   i am the voice of mother earth
   form whence all horrors have their birth

   88179a reminiscence of dr samuel johnsonh p lovecraft

   the privilege of reminiscence however rambling or tiresome is one
   generally allowd to the very aged; indeed tis frequently by means of
   such recollections that the obscure occurrences of history and the
   lesser anecdotes of the great are transmitted to posterity

   tho many of my readers have at times observd and remarkd a sort of
   antique flow in my stile of writing it hath pleased me to pass amongst
   the members of this generation as a young man giving out the fiction
   that i was born in 1890 in america i am now however resolvd to
   unburthen myself of a secret which i have hitherto kept thro dread of
   incredulity; and to impart to the publick a true knowledge of my long
   years in order to gratifie their taste for authentick information of
   an age with whose famous personages i was on familiar terms be it then
   known that i was born on the family estate in devonshire of the 10th
   day of august 1690 (or in the new gregorian stile of reckoning the
   20th of august) being therefore now in my 228th year coming early to
   london i saw as a child many of the celebrated men of king williams
   reign including the lamented mr dryden who sat much at the tables of
   wills coffeehouse with mr addison and dr swift i later became very
   well acquainted and was an even more familiar friend to mr pope whom
   i knew and respected till the day of his death but since it is of my
   more recent associate the late dr johnson that i am at this time
   desird to write; i will pass over my youth for the present

   i had first knowledge of the doctor in may of the year 1738 tho i did
   not at that time meet him mr pope had just compleated his epilogue to
   his satires (the piece beginning: not twice a twelvemonth you appear
   in print) and had arrangd for its publication on the very day it
   appeard there was also publishd a satire in imitation of juvenal
   intituld london by the then unknown johnson; and this so struck the
   town that many gentlemen of taste declared it was the work of a
   greater poet than mr pope notwithstanding what some detractors have
   said of mr popes petty jealousy he gave the verses of his new rival
   no small praise; and having learnt thro mr richardson who the poet
   was told me that mr johnson woud soon be deterré

   i had no personal acquaintance with the doctor till 1763 when i was
   presented to him at the mitre tavern by mr james boswell a young
   scotchman of excellent family and great learning but small wit whose
   metrical effusions i had sometimes revisd

   dr johnson as i beheld him was a full pursy man very ill drest
   and of slovenly aspect i recall him to have worn a bushy bobwig
   untyed and without powder and much too small for his head his cloaths
   were of rusty brown much wrinkled and with more than one button
   missing his face too full to be handsom was likewise marred by the
   effects of some scrofulous disorder; and his head was continually
   rolling about in a sort of convulsive way of this infirmity indeed i
   had known before; having heard of it from mr pope who took the
   trouble to make particular inquiries

   being nearly seventythree full nineteen years older than dr johnson
   (i say doctor tho his degree came not till two years afterward) i
   naturally expected him to have some regard for my age; and was
   therefore not in that fear of him which others confessd on my asking
   him what he thought of my favourable notice of his dictionary in the
   londoner my periodical paper he said: sir i possess no recollection
   of having perusd your paper and have not a great interest in the
   opinions of the less thoughtful part of mankind being more than a
   little piqued at the incivility of one whose celebrity made me
   solicitous of his approbation i venturd to retaliate in kind and
   told him i was surprisd that a man of sense shoud judge the
   thoughtfulness of one whose productions he admitted never having read
   why sir replyd johnson i do not require to become familiar with
   a mans writings in order to estimate the superficiality of his
   attainments when he plainly skews it by his eagerness to mention his
   own productions in the first question he puts to me having thus
   become friends we conversd on many matters when to agree with him
   i said i was distrustful of the authenticity of ossians poems mr
   johnson said: that sir does not do your understanding particular
   credit; for what all the town is sensible of is no great discovery for
   a grubstreet critick to make you might as well say you have a strong
   suspicion that milton wrote paradise lost!

   i thereafter saw johnson very frequently most often at meetings of the
   literary club which was founded the next year by the doctor together
   with mr burke the parliamentary orator mr beauclerk a gentleman of
   fashion mr langton a pious man and captain of militia sir j
   reynolds the widely known painter dr goldsmith the prose and
   poetick writer dr nugent fatherinlaw to mr burke sir john
   hawkins mr anthony charmier and my self we assembled generally at
   seven oclock of an evening once a week at the turkshead in
   gerrardstreet soho till that tavern was sold and made into a private
   dwelling; after which event we movd our gatherings successively to
   princes in sackvillestreet le telliers in doverstreet and
   parsloes and the thatched house in st jamessstreet in these
   meetings we preservd a remarkable degree of amity and tranquillity
   which contrasts very favourably with some of the dissensions and
   disruptions i observe in the literary and amateur press associations of
   today this tranquillity was the more remarkable because we had
   amongst us gentlemen of very opposed opinions dr johnson and i as
   well as many others were high tories; whilst mr burke was a whig and
   against the american war many of his speeches on that subject having
   been widely publishd the least congenial member was one of the
   founders sir john hawkins who hath since written many
   misrepresentations of our society sir john an eccentrick fellow once
   declind to pay his part of the reckoning for supper because twas his
   custom at home to eat no supper later he insulted mr burke in so
   intolerable a manner that we all took pains to shew our disapproval;
   after which incident he came no more to our meetings however he never
   openly fell out with the doctor and was the executor of his will; tho
   mr boswell and others have reason to question the genuineness of his
   attachment other and later members of the club were mr david garrick
   the actor and early friend of dr johnson messieurs tho and jos
   warton dr adam smith dr percy author of the reliques mr edw
   gibbon the historian dr burney the musician mr malone the
   critick and mr boswell mr garrick obtaind admittance only with
   difficulty; for the doctor notwithstanding his great friendship was
   for ever affecting to decry the stage and all things connected with it
   johnson indeed had a most singular habit of speaking for davy when
   others were against him and of arguing against him when others were
   for him i have no doubt that he sincerely lovd mr garrick for he
   never alluded to him as he did to foote who was a very coarse fellow
   despite his comick genius mr gibbon was none too well likd for he
   had an odious sneering way which offended even those of us who most
   admird his historical productions mr goldsmith a little man very
   vain of his dress and very deficient in brilliancy of conversation was
   my particular favourite; since i was equally unable to shine in the
   discourse he was vastly jealous of dr johnson tho none the less
   liking and respecting him i remember that once a foreigner a german
   i think was in our company; and that whilst goldsmith was speaking he
   observd the doctor preparing to utter something unconsciously looking
   upon goldsmith as a meer encumbrance when compard to the greater man
   the foreigner bluntly interrupted him and incurrd his lasting
   hostility by crying hush toctor shonson iss going to speak!

   in this luminous company i was tolerated more because of my years than
   for my wit or learning; being no match at all for the rest my
   friendship for the celebrated monsieur voltaire was ever a cause of
   annoyance to the doctor; who was deeply orthodox and who usd to say
   of the french philosopher: vir est acerrimi ingenii et paucarum
   literarum

   mr boswell a little teazing fellow whom i had known for some time
   previously usd to make sport of my aukward manners and oldfashiond
   wig and cloaths once coming in a little the worse for wine (to which
   he was addicted) he endeavourd to lampoon me by means of an impromptu
   in verse writ on the surface of the table; but lacking the aid he
   usually had in his composition he made a bad grammatical blunder i
   told him he shoud not try to pasquinade the source of his poesy at
   another time bozzy (as we usd to call him) complaind of my harshness
   toward new writers in the articles i prepard for the monthly review
   he said i pushd every aspirant off the slopes of parnassus sir i
   replyd you are mistaken they who lose their hold do so from their
   own want of strength; but desiring to conceal their weakness they
   attribute the absence of success to the first critick that mentions
   them i am glad to recall that dr johnson upheld me in this matter

   dr johnson was second to no man in the pains he took to revise the bad
   verses of others; indeed tis said that in the book of poor blind old
   mrs williams there are scarce two lines which are not the doctors
   at one time johnson recited to me some lines by a servant to the duke
   of leeds which had so amusd him that he had got them by heart they
   are on the dukes wedding and so much resemble in quality the work of
   other and more recent poetick dunces that i cannot forbear copying
   them:

     when the duke of leeds shall marryd be
     to a fine young lady of high quality
     how happy will that gentlewoman be
     in his grace of leeds good company

   i askd the doctor if he had ever tryd making sense of this piece;
   and upon his saying he had not i amusd myself with the following
   amendment of it:

     when gallant leeds auspiciously shall wed
     the virtuous fair of antient lineage bred
     how must the maid rejoice with conscious pride
     to win so great an husband to her side!

   on shewing this to dr johnson he said sir you have straightened
   out the feet but you have put neither wit nor poetry into the lines

   it woud afford me gratification to tell more of my experiences with
   dr johnson and his circle of wits; but i am an old man and easily
   fatigued i seem to ramble along without much logick or continuity when
   i endeavour to recall the past; and fear i light upon but few incidents
   which others have not before discussd shoud my present recollections
   meet with favour i might later set down some further anecdotes of old
   times of which i am the only survivor i recall many things of sam
   johnson and his club having kept up my membership in the latter long
   after the doctors death at which i sincerely mournd i remember how
   john burgoyne esq the general whose dramatick and poetical works
   were printed after his death was blackballed by three votes; probably
   because of his unfortunate defeat in the american war at saratoga
   poor john! his son fared better i think and was made a baronet but i
   am very tired i am old very old and it is time for my afternoon nap

   an american to mother england

   england! my england! can the surging sea
   that lies between us tear my heart from thee?
   can distant birth and distant dwelling drain
   th ancestral blood that warms the loyal vein?
   isle of my fathers! hear the filial song
   of him whose sources but to thee belong!
   worldconquering mother! by thy mighty hand
   was carvd from savage wilds my native land:
   thy matchless sons the firm foundation laid;
   thy matchless arts the nascent nation made:
   by thy just laws the young republic grew
   and through thy greatness kindred greatness knew
   what man that springs from thy untainted line
   but sees columbias virtues all as thine?
   whilst nameless multitudes upon our shore
   from the dim corners of creation pour
   whilst mongrel slaves crawl hither to partake
   of saxon liberty they could not make
   from such an alien crew in grief i turn
   and for the mothers voice of britain burn
   england! can aught remove the cherishd chain
   that binds my spirit to thy blest domain?
   can revolutions bitter precepts sway
   the soul that must the ties of race obey?
   create a new columbia if ye will
   the flesh that forms me is britannic still!
   hail! oaken shades and meads of dewy green
   so oft in sleep yet neer in waking seen
   peal out ye ancient chimes from vineclad tower
   where prayd my fathers in a vanishd hour:
   what countless years of revrence can ye claim
   from bygone worshippers that bore my name!
   their forms are crumbling in the vaults around
   whilst i across the sea but dream the sound
   return sweet vision! let me glimpse again
   the stonebuilt abbey rising oer the plain;
   the neighbring village with its sunshowerd square;
   the shaded millstream and the forest fair
   the hedgelind lane that leads to rustic cot
   where sweet contentment is the peasants lot:
   the mystic grove by druid wraiths possessd
   the flowring fields with fairycastles blest:
   and the old manorhouse sedate and dark
   set in the shadows of the wooded park
   can this be dreaming? must my eyelids close
   that i may catch the fragrance of the rose?
   is it in fancy that the midnight vale
   thrills with the warblings of the nightingale?
   a golden moon bewitching radiance yields
   and englands fairies trip oer englands fields
   england! old england! in my love for thee
   no dream is mine but blessed memory;
   such haunting images and hidden fires
   course with the bounding blood of british sires:
   from british bodies minds and souls i come
   and from them draw the vision of their home
   awake columbia! scorn the vulgar age
   that bids thee slight thy lordly heritage
   let not the wide atlantics wildest wave
   burst the blest bonds that favring nature gave:
   connecting surges `twixt the nations run
   our saxon souls dissolving into one!

   an appreciation

   in last tuesdays issue of the american appeared the hunger by andrew
   francis lockhart the poem considered by h p lovecraft a boston
   critic as equal to rileys an old sweetheart of mine here is the
   critics own opinion of andys poetry:

   to mr lockhart on his poetry

   whilst the town poet doddring in decay
   with hopeless drivel drives the muse away
   pleased with the clattring of some formless line
   that only he can fathom or define;
   while sense and rhyme are banishd as too hard
   till evry chimneysweep can turn a bard;
   how great our joy to leave the freeverse throng
   and ease our ears with lockharts moving song!
   melodious lockhart! whose aonian art
   transmits the pulsing of the simple heart;
   whose homely pen no languid soul dissects
   whose polished line no culturd fog reflects;
   from grecian stores he bears no tinsel pelf
   content to be a classic in himself!
   let feebler wits their cumbrous couplets weight
   with dry allusiondullness specious freight
   or deck with sounding words the empty length;
   of stilted odes to hide their want of strength;
   our milbank bard such formal trash disdains
   and fresh from nature draws his rural strains
   tis not for him in solitude to scan
   the pedants page and shun the haunts of man;
   tis not for him in books alone to trace
   the moods and passions of our mortal race;
   close to mankind his deft experienced quill
   portrays his fellows with familiar skill
   no borrowd sentiment or mimic rage
   stalks coldly through our poets glowing page:
   fancys true visions evry line inspire
   and fill each melody with genuine fire
   charmd by the sound the cynic stops to hear
   and sheds against his will the human tear
   what rising fame will future ages bring
   to lockhart master of the lyric string?
   with what fond honours will the minstrel move
   amongst the muses of the sacred grove?
   skilld in sweet harmonies supremely blest
   with all the genius of his native west
   his lofty brow deserves the laurel crown
   that none hath worn since riley laid it down!

   o give me the life of the village
         uninhibited free and sweet;
   the place where the arts all flourish
         grove court and christopher street
   i am sick of the old conventions
         and critics who will not praise
   so sing ho for the open spaces
         and aesthetes with kindly ways
   here every bard is a genius
         and artists are raphaels
   and above the roofs of patchin place
         the muse of talent dwells

   published c 25 november 1917
   9363astrophobosh p lovecraft1917

   in the midnight heavens burning
   through the ethereal deeps afar
   once i watchd with restless yearning
   an alluring aureate star;
   evry eve aloft returning
   gleaming nigh the arctic car
   mystic waves of beauty blended
   with the gorgeous golden rays
   phantasies of bliss descended
   in a myrrhd elysian haze
   in the lyreborn chords extended
   harmonies of lydian lays
   and (thought i) lies scenes of pleasure
   where the free and blessed dwell
   and each moment bears a treasure
   freighted with the lotosspell
   and there floats a liquid measure
   from the lute of israfel
   there (i told myself) were shining
   worlds of happiness unknown
   peace and innocence entwining
   by the crowned virtues throne;
   men of light their thoughts refining
   purer fairer than my own
   thus i musd when oer the vision
   crept a red delirious change;
   hope dissolving to derision
   beauty to distortion strange;
   hymnic chords in weird collision
   spectral sights in endless range
   crimson burnd the star of madness
   as behind the beams i peerd;
   all was woe that seemd but gladness
   ere my gaze with truth was seard;
   cacodaemons mird with madness
   through the feverd flickring leerd
   now i know the fiendish fable
   then the golden glitter bore;
   now i shun the spangled sable
   that i watchd and lovd before;
   but the horror set and stable
   haunts my soul forevermore!

   at the root  (1918)
   by h p lovecraft
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   written 1918 published in the united amateur 17 no 6 (july 1918)
   11112
   9568at the rooth p lovecraft1918

   to those who look beneath the surface the present universal war drives
   home more than one anthropological truth in striking fashion; and of
   the verities none is more profound than that relating to the essential
   immutability of mankind and its instincts

   four years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under
   certain biological fallacies which may in a sense be held responsible
   for the extent and duration of the present conflict these fallacies
   which were the foundation of pacifism and other pernicious forms of
   social and political radicalism dealt with the capacity of man to
   evolve mentally beyond his former state of subservience to primate
   instinct and pugnacity and to conduct his affairs and international or
   interracial relations on a basis of reason and goodwill that belief
   in such capability is unscientific and childishly naive is beside the
   question the fact remains that the most civilised part of the world
   including our own anglosaxondom did entertain enough of these notions
   to relax military vigilance lay stress on points of honour place
   trust in treaties and permit a powerful and unscrupulous nation to
   indulge unchecked and unsuspected in nearly fifty years of preparation
   for worldwide robbery and slaughter we are reaping the result of our
   simplicity

   the past is over our former follies we can but regret and expiate as
   best we may by a crusade to the death against the transrhenane monster
   which we allowed to grow and flourish beneath our very eyes but the
   future holds more of responsibility and we must prepare to guard
   against any renascence of the benevolent delusions that four years of
   blood have barely been able to discard forever the sentimental
   standpoint and to view our species through the cold eyes of science
   alone we must recognise the essential underlaying savagery in the
   animal called man and return to older and sounder principles of
   national life and defense we must realise that mans nature will
   remain the same so long as he remains man; that civilisation is but a
   slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast sleeps lightly and
   ever ready to awake to preserve civilisation we must deal
   scientifically with the brute element using only genuine biological
   principles in considering ourselves we think too much of ethics and
   sociology  too little of plain natural history we should perceive
   that mans period of historical existence a period so short that his
   physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest degree is
   insufficient to allow of any considerable mental change the instincts
   that governed the egyptians and the assyrians of old govern us as
   well; and as the ancients thought grasped struggled and deceived so
   shall we moderns continue to think grasp struggle and deceive in our
   inmost hearts change is only superficial and apparent

   mans respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental
   constitution and environment through certain modes of thought and
   training it can be elevated tremendously yet there is always a limit
   the man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths the
   restraints imposed by conventions and honour but beyond a certain
   point primitive will or desire cannot be curbed denied anything
   ardently desired the individual or state will argue and parley just so
   long  then if the impelling motive be sufficiently great will cast
   aside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition plunging
   viciously after the object wished; all the more fantastically savage
   because of previous repression the sole ultimate factor in human
   decisions is physical force this we must learn however repugnant the
   idea may seem if we are to protect ourselves and our institutions
   reliance on anything else is fallacious and ruinous dangerous beyond
   description are the voices sometimes heard today decrying the
   continuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities

   the specific application of the scientific truth regarding mans native
   instincts will be found in the adoption of a postbellum international
   programme obviously we must take into account the primordial
   substructure and arrange for the upholding of culture by methods which
   will stand the acid test of stress and conflicting ambitions in
   disillusioned diplomacy ample armament and universal military
   training alone will be found the solution of the worlds difficulties
   it will not be a perfect solution because humanity is not perfect it
   will not abolish war because war is the expression of a natural human
   tendency but it will at least produce an approximate stability of
   social and political conditions and prevent the menace of the entire
   world by the greed of any one of its constituent parts

about lovecraft[edit]

      to howard phillips lovecraft by george henry weiss in weird
       tales (march 1938 vol 31 no 3)
      h p lovecraft: a bibliography by joseph payne brennan (1952)
      h p lovecraft an evaluation by joseph payne brennan (1955)

copyrights[edit]

      for the call of cthulhu the relevant records are in the years
       1953 1954 and 1955

      according to st joshis hp lovecraft: a life (pp 640641):
       much of lovecrafts work is in the public domain this is
       unquestionably so in terms of the tales essays and poems
       published in the amateur press as for stories published in weird
       tales the six that the magazine owned outright should have had
       their copyrights renewed after twentyeight years but repeated
       searches in the library of congress have turned up no renewals of
       any kind of the stories lovecraft himself controlled by law only
       he his heirs or his executor could have renewed the rights but
       this was never done

      chris karr has reviewed these documents and has published a report
       of his findings at
       http://wwwaetherialnet/personal/files/lovecraft_renewalspdf  in
       short there are no copyright records that reference any of
       lovecrafts original stories (only the arkham house compilations)
       but the copyrights to weird tales were renewed properly and
       works published prior to 1926 (when lovecraft is thought to have
       sold full rights to weird tales) in that magazine may be subject
       to protection if they were published in weird tales for the first
       time joshi identifies thirteen works and believes that seven of
       those thirteen had been published elsewhere previously

   pdiconsvg the copyright of some works by this author were assigned by
   the author to another party and that assignee renewed the copyright at
   the appropriate time in the assignees own name after the death of
   the author however some works by this author are in the public domain
   in the united states because the renewal copyrights were never vested
   in the assignees who made the copyright renewal application the author
   must be alive at the start of the copyright renewal term for the
   authors prior assignments to vest if however the author dies before
   vesting of the renewal copyright the party to whom the
   renewalcopyright interest was conveyed loses the entitlement to that
   interest therefore some copyright renewals were not valid

public domain[edit]

   im quite interested to know how the works of hp lovecraft came to be
   in wikibooks: can i now assume some of his works including the call of
   cthulhu are now in the public domain? if so id be interested to know
   why they are now in the public domain and what were the original
   sources for the works included here? axon 14:24 3 jan 2005 (utc)

          a source for publication information for lovecrafts stories is
          http://wwwdagonbytescom/thelibrary/lovecraft/ i would also
          recommend examining the links listed on the article page
          concerning s t joshis research i examined the project
          gutenberg compilations of copyright renewal information and
          could find no references to lovecraft at all in the records from
          1953 to 1967 although there were a number of renewals by august
          derleth all were for mr derleths own work there were no
          renewal notices whatsoever for donald wandrei if any other
          supposed copyright holders make themselves known their claims
          could be examined but until then i think it is reasonable to
          assume that the copyrights on mr lovecrafts works have
          expired  csn 02:23 30 mar 2005 (utc)

          ive just contributed transcripts of my copies of the wills of
          lovecraft his aunt gamwell and a copy of the letter from
          morris and lewis to arkham house more commonly known the
          morrishlewis gift if i can be of further assistance contact

spliting works section[edit]

   the works section was originally split into cthulhu mythos novels and
   other novels someone changed cthulhu to arkham since not all the
   novels refered to cthulhu but they were all generally set in the arkham
   area i think the best solution is to combine all his works into one
   section the wikipedia article breaks his work down into macabre
   dreamcycle and cthulhu mythos but has only rough dates as a
   guideline [1] puts 12 works in the cthulhu mythos period but again
   not all of those works are about cthulhu related things csn 22:21 8
   september 2005 (utc)

cthulhu mythos/dream cycle/macabre[edit]

   shouldnt the stories be separated into these three categories?

          i believe not everybody agrees with these separations lovecraft
          himself never mentioned them

novels and short stories in chronological order[edit]

   i dont know about the rest of you but i usually prefer reading an
   authors works in the order that they were written for that reason
   im including the novels and short stories section (the one that
   interests me the most) here below in chronological writing order more
   or less (publication if thats all there is) it would probably just
   waste space to put this on the author page but maybe we could make a
   subpage for chronologically ordered lists (each type (poetry novels
   and short stories etc) in separate sections and one all together)
   dont you think? cromwellt|talk|contribs 03:34 31 may 2006 (utc)

   these only include renewals for works 19231948 probably 1949 and
   possibly 1950 anything first printed between 19501963 would need a
   renewal that can be checked at [3] and anything first published
   19642002 is still in copyright i dont believe this covers any
   fiction but it covers some poetry and probably most of his

          i dont understand prosfilaes; are you saying the renewals
          listed above and those found at copyrightgov wouldnt cover any
          of lovecrafts fiction? because the third renewal paragraph
          above clearly refers to stories resscholar (talk) 04:45 26

                yes best supernatural stories would cover the volume as
                printed the editing the compilation but none of the
                stories were first published in there so while we cant
                used the editions of the stories there published the
                stories themselves are just fineprosfilaes (talk)

cm eddy jr[edit]

   i dont really like moving this to an attributed section its clear
   that hpl did have influence on them; no one is denying that i dont
   know what exactly was done but these are not attributed to; they are
   hpl is given credit as a collaborator for the work he did on them
   even if they only amounted to a couple sentences ([4] mentions
   specifically some of these changes at the bottom of the comments) the
   fine distinctions about what work he did on them belong on the work
   page imoprosfilaes (talk) 01:45 25 march 2012 (utc)

          yes apparently even an attributed section isnt enough and
          wasnt quite right anyway putting everything in one section is
          the only sensible solution however that isnt going to stop
          the reversions ive added a sentence to try to mitigate that
          but theres chance the user doing this wont even read it

   when age fell upon the world and wonder went out of the minds of men;
   when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly in
   whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of springs flowering
   meads; when learning stripped the earth of her mantle of beauty and
   poets sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and
   inward looking eyes; when these things had come to pass and childish
   hopes had gone forever there was a man who traveled out of life on a
   quest into spaces whither the worlds dreams had fled

   of the name and abode of this man little is written for they were of
   the waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure it is
   enough to say that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile
   twilight reigned that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil
   coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not to open
   fields and groves but on to a dim court where other windows stared in
   dull despair from that casement one might see only walls and windows
   except sometimes when one leaned so far out and peered at the small
   stars that passed and because mere walls and windows must soon drive a
   man to madness who dreams and reads much the dweller in that room used
   night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment
   of things beyond the waking world and the tall cities after years he
   began to call the slow sailing stars by name and to follow them in
   fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his
   vision opened to many secret vistas whose existance no common eye
   suspected and one night a mighty gulf was bridged and the dream
   haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watchers window to merge with
   the close air of his room and to make him a part of their fabulous
   wonder

   there came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with
   dust of gold vortices of dust and fire swirling out of the ultimate
   spaces and heavy perfumes from beyond the worlds opiate oceans poured
   there litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their
   whirlpools strange dolphins and seanymphs of unrememberable depths
   noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away
   without touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window;
   and for days not counted in mens calendars the tides of far spheres
   that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly
   left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore a green shore fragrant with
   lotus blossoms and starred by red camalates

   powers meredith at his showerbath before dinner in the bathroom
   adjoining his room in his new york city club allowed the cake of soap
   to drop on the tiled floor stooping to recover it he rapped the side
   of his head against the marble sidewall the resulting bruise was
   painful and almost at once puffed up into a noticeable lump 

   meredith dined in the grill that evening having no afterdinner
   engagement he went into the quiet library of the club empty at this
   hour and settled himself with a new book beside a softlyshaded
   reading lamp

   from time to time a slight inadvertent pressure of his head against
   the chairs leather upholstered back would remind him unpleasantly of
   his accident in the showerbath this after it happened several times
   became an annoyance and meredith shifted himself into a preventive
   attitude with his legs draped over one of the chairs rounded arms

   no one else came into the library faint clicking noises came in from
   the nearby billiardroom where a couple of men were playing but
   absorbed in his book he did not notice these the only perceptible
   sound was that of the gentle steady rain outside this in the form of
   a soothing continuous murmur came through the partlyopened high
   windows he read on

   precisely as he turned over the ninetysixth page of his book he heard
   a dull sound like a very large explosion coming from a vast distance

   alert now his finger holding his place in the book he listened then
   he heard a rumbling roar as though countless tons of wrecked masonry
   were falling; falling; clearly unmistakably the remote thunder of
   some catastrophic ruin he dropped his book and obeying an almost
   automatic impulse started for the door

   he met nobody as he rushed down the stairs at the coatroom which he
   had to pass on his way to the doorway two fellow members were chatting
   easily as they took their checks meredith glanced at them surprised
   he rushed on to the doorway and out into the street where he paused
   an empty street!

   the rain reduced now to a mere drizzle made the asphalt shimmer in
   the street lights over towards broadway certainly there must be
   clamor! but when he reached it he found only the compound eleven
   oclock bedlam of times square

   along sixth avenue countless taxicabs weaved in a manyhued stream
   jockeying for position in the maëlström of the nighttraffic about the
   hippodrome on the corner a solitary rubbercoated policeman swung
   long efficient arms like a pair of mechanical semaphores and
   skillfully directed the crawling traffic to his everincreasing
   wonderment everything seemed normal but what then had been that
   catastrophic sound?

   returning to the club entrance he hesitated a frown creasing his
   brow he mounted the three steps hesitatingly and entered pausing at
   the doormans desk `

   send me up an `extra please if one comes out he told the clerk
   then he went up to his bedroom completely puzzled

   half an hour later as he lay in bed wakeful and trying to compose in
   his thoughts the varying incongruous aspect of this strange affair he
   was all at once acutely conscious of a distant thin confused roaring
   hum the most prominent element in this sound was the deep soft and
   insistently penetrating blending of countless voices through it ran a
   kind of dominant notea note of horror the sound chilled his blood
   it was eerie he found himself holding his breath as he listened
   straining every faculty to take in that faint distant terrible clamor
   of fear and despair

   of just when he fell asleep he had no recollection but when he
   awakened the next morning there hung over his mind a shadow of
   remembered horror not wholly dissipated until he had bathed and begun
   to dress he heard none of the sounds at the time of his awakening

   no extra lay outside his bedroom door and a little later at
   breakfast he opened expectantly and scanned several newspapers vainly
   and with a mounting sense of wonderment for any account of a
   catastrophe which could have caused the sounds gradually the
   implication grew upon him he had actually heard the convincing
   unmistakable evidence of such a catastropheand no one else knew
   anything about it!

   he fell asleep immediately after turning in

   the following morning was sunday the readingroom was full and he
   carried his book up to his bedroom after late breakfast to read the
   rest of it in peace soon after he became immersed in it his attention
   was distracted by the tapping of a windowshade blown in and out by
   the breeze it was annoying and he paused in his reading intending to
   rise and adjust the shade

   as he withdrew his eyes and part of his attention from his book all
   at once he heard a new sound it was precisely as though a distant
   soundproof door had been abruptly opened

   as he listened fascinated there came back to him and grew upon him a
   paralyzing cold fear there seemed to be no stopping it the faint
   penumbra of a slight nausea shook him he could distinguish overtones
   now high tones cries of battle; the impact of a charge against a
   resistant horde; noise of plied weapons

   the windowshade tapped again against the window casing he snapped
   back into the familiar environment of his bedroom he felt a little
   sick and weak he rose shakily walked across the room and into the
   bathroom and noisily splashing the water about washed his hands and
   face

   then he paused suddenly to listen again a towel gripped between
   clenched hands but he could hear nothing now nothing except the
   tapping of that windowshade in the fresh breeze blowing through the
   open window he hung the towel on its porcelain rod and walked back to
   his chair

   it was an hour too early for lunch but he wanted urgently to be where
   there were people about even waiters people who were not hearing
   things!

   in order to prolong his companionship with old cavanagh the only other
   early luncher meredith ate somewhat more than usual the unaccustomed
   heavy meal at such an hour made him drowsy and after lunch he
   stretched out on a davenport before one of the two open fireplaces in
   the now unoccupied readingroom and fell at once into an uneasy sleep

   a little before three he awakened stale and as he came to conscious
   wakefulness he began to hear at first quite distinctly and then with
   increasing loudness and clarity asthough a steady hand were opening
   up a loudspeaker that same sound of fire and human conflict and the
   dreadful menacing roar of a thunderous oceans incalculable anger

   then old cavanagh napping on the other davenport struggled with
   senile deliberation to his feet with many accompanying hums and
   has and began lumbering across the room towards him

   lords sake whats the matter? he demanded

   kindly goodwill looked out of the old mans distorted countenance
   meredith unable to control himself any longer stammered out his
   incredible story

   hm! strange    was the old mans comment when meredith ended he
   produced lighted deliberately and puffed upon an enormous cigar he
   seemed to cogitate as the two sat side by side in a pregnant silence of
   many minutes at last he spoke

   youre upset my boy naturally but you can hear everything thats
   going on around you cant you? your actual hearings all right then
   hm! this other `hearing starts up and goes on only when everythings
   perfectly quiet first time you were here reading; second time in
   bed; third time reading again; this timeif i wasnt snoringyou
   were in perfect quiet once more lets test that out now keep
   perfectly still and ill do the same lets see if you hear anything

   they fell silent once more and for a while meredith could hear nothing
   of the strange sounds then as the silence deepened once again came
   that complex of sounds indicating devastating battle murder and
   sudden death

   he nodded silently at cavanagh and at the old mans acquiescent murmur
   the sounds ceased abruptly

   it took urging before meredith could be persuaded to consult an aurist
   medical men cavanagh reminded him would keep quiet about anything
   strange or embarrassing professional ethics

   they went uptown together that afternoon to dr gatefield a noted
   specialist the doctor heard the story with closelipped professional
   attention then he tested merediths hearing with various delicate
   instruments finally he gave an opinion

   we are familiar with various `earnoises mr meredith in some cases
   the location of one of the arteries too close to the eardrum gives
   `roaring noises there are others similar i have eliminated
   everything of that kind your physical organism is in excellent
   condition and unusually acute there is nothing wrong with your
   hearing this is a case for a psychiatrist

   i am not suggesting anything like mental derangement you will please
   understand! but i recommend dr cowlington this seems to be a clear
   case of what is sometimes called `clairaudience or something
   similarhis department; not mine the aural equivalent of
   `clairvoyance is what i am indicating you see what i mean
   `secondsight has to do with the eyes of course but it is mental
   although there is often some physical background i have no knowledge
   of those phenomena i hope you will take my advice and allow dr
   cowling

   all right! interrupted meredith where does he live? i might as well
   go through with the thing now as later

   dr gatefield showed traces of sympathy under his rather frosty
   professional exterior he dropped the diagnostician became the
   obliging courteous gentleman he telephoned to his colleague the
   psychiatrist and then surprised both meredith and cavanagh by
   accompanying them to dr cowlingtons the psychiatrist proved to be a
   tall thin and rather kindly person with heavy complex spectacles on
   a prominent nose and then sandcolored wisps of hair in a
   complication of cowlicks he showed marked interest in the case from
   the start after hearing merediths story and the aurists report he
   subjected meredith to an examination of more than an hour from which
   feeling more or less as though he had been dissected he nevertheless
   derived a considerable sense of relief

   it was decided that meredith should arrange at once to take several
   days off come to dr cowlingtons house and remain under
   observation

   he arrived at the doctors the next morning and was given a pleasant
   upstairs room with many books and a comfortable davenport on which in
   a recumbent position the psychiatrist suggested he should spend most
   of his waking hours reading

   during monday and tuesday meredith now after dr cowlingtons
   skillful reassurances no longer upset at hearing the strange sounds
   listened carefully for whatever might reach him from what seemed like
   anotherand very restlessworld! he heard as he listened for long
   periods uninterrupted by any aural distractions the drama of a great
   community in the paralyzing grip of fearfighting for its corporate
   lifeagainst irresistible impending dreadful doom

   he began about this time at dr cowlingtons suggestion to write
   down some of the syllabification of the cries and shouts as well as he
   could manage it on a purely phonetic basis the sounds corresponded to
   no language known to him the words and phrases were blurred and marred
   by the continuous uproar of the fury of waters this was invariably
   and continued to be the sustained distinctive background for every
   sound he heard during the periods while he remained passive and quiet
   the various words and phrases were entirely unintelligible his notes
   looked like nothing which either he or cowlington could relate to any
   modern or ancient tongue when read aloud they made nothing but
   gibberish

   these strange terms were studied over very carefully by dr cowlington
   by meredith himself and by no less than three professors of
   archeology and comparative philology one of whom the archeologist
   was a friend of cowlingtons and the other two called in by him all of
   these experts on ancient and obsolete languages listened with the
   greatest courtesy to merediths attempt to explain the apparent setting
   of the soundsmost of them were in the nature of battlecries and
   what meredith took to be fragments of desperately uttered prayersome
   of the material having come to him in the form of uncouth raucous
   howlsand with the greatest interest to his attempts at reproducing
   them orally they studied his written notes with the most meticulous
   care the verdict was unanimous even emphatic on the part of the
   younger and more dogmatic philologist these sounds were quite utterly
   at variance with any known speech including sanskrit indoiranian
   and even the conjectural akkadian and sumerian spoken tongues the
   transcribed syllables corresponded to nothing in any known language
   ancient or modern emphatically they were not japanese

   the three professors took their departure and meredith and the
   psychiatrist dr cowlington went over the list again

   meredith had written: i i i i;rlyeh!ieh nya ieh nya;
   zoh zohannuh! there was only one grouping of the words which
   formed anything like a section of continuous speech or sentence and
   which meredith had been able to capture more or less intact and write
   downióth ióthnatcalo do yan kho thútthut

   there were many other cries and as he believed desperately uttered
   prayers quite as strange and off the beaten tracks of recognized human
   speech as those noted down

   it was quite possibly because of his concentration on this affair of
   the remembered wordshis own interest in them being naturally enhanced
   by dr cowlingtons and that of the three expertsthat merediths
   dreamstate impressions just at this time and suddenly became
   markedly acute these dreams had been continuous and consecutive since
   their beginning several nights before but on this night after the
   rather elaborate investigation of the words and syllables meredith
   began in earnest to get the affair of his environment in the strange
   city of the flames and conflicts and confusion and of a roaring ocean
   cleared up with a startling abruptness his dream impression that night
   was so utterly vivid; so acutely identical with the terms of the waking
   state; that he couldnt tell the difference between his dream slumber
   and wakeful consciousness!

   everything that he had derived mentally out of that nights sleep was
   clearly and definitely present in his mind it seemed to him precisely
   as though he had not been asleep; that he had not emerged from an
   ordinary nights rest into the accustomed circumstances of an early
   mornings awakening it was rather as though he had very abruptly
   passed out of one quite definite life into another; as though as it
   came to him afterwards he had walked out of a theatre into the wholly
   unrelated aftertheatre life of times square

   one of the radical phases of this situation was not only that the
   succession of dream experiences had been continuous with
   timeallowances for the intervening periods of those daysinbetween
   which he had spent here in dr cowlingtons quiet house; not only that
   extraordinary as this realization seemed to him the nearly consecutive
   dream experiences had been the events of the past few days in a life of
   thirtytwo years spent in that same environment and civilization of
   which the cataclysmic conditions which he had been envisaging appeared
   to presage a direful end

   he was to set out plainly what he had brought out of that last nights
   dreamexperience one bothon general of the military forces of the
   great district of ludekta the southwesterly provincial division of
   the continent of atlantis which had been colonized as every atlantean
   school child was well aware some eighteen hundred years before by a
   series of emigrations from the mother continent the naacal
   languagewith minor variations not unlike the differences between
   american speech and english englishwas the common language of both
   continents

   from his native ludekta the general bothon had made several voyages to
   the mother land the first of these had been to ghua the central
   eastern province a kind of grand tour made just after his finishing
   at the age of twentytwo his professional course in the ludekta
   college of military training he was thus familiar by experience as
   were many other cultivated atlanteans of the upper classes with the
   very highly developed civilization of the mother continent these
   cultural contacts had been aided by his second visit and further
   enhanced not long before the present period of the dreamexperiences
   when at the age of thirtyone bothon already of the rank of general
   had been sent out as ambassador to agladdho joint capital of the
   confederated southeastern provinces of yish knan and buathon one of
   the most strategic diplomatic posts and the second most important
   provincial confederation of the mother continent

   he had served in his ambassadorial capacity for only four months and
   then had been abruptly recalled without explanation but as he had
   soon discovered upon his arrival home because of the privately
   communicated request of the emperor himself his diplomatic superiors
   at home offered him no censure such imperial requests were not
   unknown these gentlemen were actually quite unaware of the reasons
   behind the imperial request no explanations had been given them but
   there had been no imperial censure of any kind

   but the general bothon knew the reasons very well although he kept
   them strictly to himself there was indeed only one reason as he was
   acutely and very well aware

   the requirements of his office had taken him rather frequently to alu
   the continental capital metropolis of the civilized world

   here in the great city of alu were assembled from all known parts of
   the terrestrial globe the worlds diplomats artists philosophers
   traders and shipmasters here in the great warehouses of solid stone
   and along the innumerable wharves were piled the worlds goodsfabrics
   and perfumes; strange animals for the delectation of the untraveled
   curious here in the endless stalls and markets were dyed stuffs and
   silks; tubas and cymbals and musical rattles and lyres; choice woods
   and implements for the toiletstrigils and curiously carved
   handfitting little blocks of soapstone and oils innumerable for the
   freshening of beards and the anointing of bodies here were tunics and
   sandals and belts and thongs of softtanned variously perfumed
   leathers here were displayed carved and cunningly wrought pieces of
   household furnitureglowing burnished wallmirrors of copper and tin
   and steel bedsteads of an infinite range and design cushions of
   swans feathers tables of plain and polished artizanship and of
   intarsia with metal scrolls set flush to their levels; marquetry work
   of contrasting woodschairs and stools and cupboards and chests and
   footrests here were ornaments innumerablefirescreens and
   spindles for parchmentrolls and tongs and shades for lamps made of
   the scraped skins of animals; metal lamps of every design and
   vegetable oils for the lamps in earthenware jars of many sizes and
   shapes here were foods and wines and dried fruits and honey of many
   flavors; grains and dried meats and loaves of barley and wheatmeal
   past computation here in the great street of the armorers were maces
   and axes and swords and daggers of all the worlds varieties and
   designs; armor of plate and chainhauberks and greaves and bassinets
   and shelves with rows and rows of the heavy plate and helmets
   standardized for the use of such fighting men as bothon himself
   commanded in their thousands

   here were to be seen and examined costly canopies and the elaborate
   litters in which the slaves of the rich carried their masters through
   the narrow streets and broad airy avenues of alu rugs there were in
   an endless profusion of size and shape and design; rugs from distant
   lemuria and from atlantis and from tropical antillea and from the
   mountainous interior regions of the mother continent itself where
   thousands of cunning weavers of fabrics worked at their looms; ordinary
   rugs of pressed felt and gorgeous glowing rugs of silk from the
   southern regions where the mulberry trees grew; rugs too and thin
   soft draperies of complex patterns made of the wool of lambs and of the
   long silklike hair of the mountain sheep

   here in alu center of the worlds culture were philosophers with
   their groups of disciples small or great propounding their systems on
   the corners of streets and in the public squares wrangling incessantly
   over the end of man and the greatest good and the origin of material
   things here were vast libraries containing the essence of all that had
   been written down concerning science and religion and engineering and
   the innumerable fine arts of the civilization of forty thousand years
   here were the temples of religion where the hierarchs propounded the
   principles of life colleges of priests studying incessantly more and
   more deeply into the mysteries of the four principles; teaching the
   people the endless applications of these esoteric affairs to their
   conduct and daily lives

   into this fascinating treasure house of a great civilization the
   ambassador bothon had penetrated as often as possible the excellence
   of his family background his own character and personal qualities and
   his official position all combined to make him a welcome guest in the
   mansions of the members of the emperors court and of the highest
   stratum of social life in alu

   an impressionable young man most of whose life previous to his
   appointment as ambassador had been spent in hard training for his
   military duties and in the rigorous prosecution of these as he rose
   rapidly grade by grade by hard mans work in camp and field during his
   many campaigns in the standing army of ludekta the general bothon
   revelled in these many high social contacts very soon he found within
   himself and growing apace the strong and indeed natural desire for a
   type of life to which his backgrounds and achievements had amply
   entitled him but of which he had been so far deprived because of the
   wellnigh incessant demands upon him of his almost continuous military
   service

   in short the ambassador from ludekta very greatly came to desire
   marriage with some lady of his own caste and preferably of this
   metropolitan city of alu with its sophistication and wide culture; a
   lady who might preside graciously over his ambassadorial establishment;
   who when his term of office was concluded would return with him to
   his native ludekta in atlantis there permanently to grace the fine
   residence he had in his minds eye when a little later he should
   retire from the ludektan army and settle down as a senator into the
   type of life which he envisaged for his middle years

   he had been both fortunate and unfortunate in his actual falling in
   love the lady who reciprocated his ardent advances was the netvissa
   ledda daughter of the netvis toldon who was the emperors brother the
   fortunate aspect of this intense and sudden love affair which set all
   social alu to commenting upon it was the altogether human one of a
   virtually perfect compatability between the two their initial mutual
   attraction had become a settled regard for each other almost overnight
   within a few days thereafter they were very deeply in love humanly
   considered the affair was perfection itself every circumstance save
   one and that a merely artificial side of the case gave promise of an
   ideal union

   the single difficulty in the way of this marriage was however most
   unfortunately an insuperable one the netvissa ledda niece of the
   emperor belonged of right to the very highest social caste of the
   empire the rank and degree of netvis lay next to royalty itself and in
   the case of the family of the netvis toldon partook of royalty against
   this fact basic in the structure of the empires longestablished
   custom the ambassador general bothon of ludektaalthough a gentleman
   of the very highest attainments character and worth whose family
   record reached back a thousand years into the dim past before the
   colonization of atlantis whose reputation was second to none in the
   empirethe general bothon was a commoner as such according to the
   rigid system prevalent at the court in alu capital of the empire he
   was hopelessly ineligible the marriage was simply out of the question

   the emperor being called upon to settle this awkward affair acted
   summarily quite in the spirit of one who destroys a hopelessly wounded
   and suffering creature as an act of mercy the emperor took the one
   course open to him under these circumstances and the general bothon
   without any choice being open to him save submission to an imperial
   request which had the force of law took ship for ludekta leaving
   behind him in alu the highest and dearest hope of his life irreparably
   shattered

   for the subsequent conduct of the general bothon recently ludektan
   ambassador to agladdho there were three very definite contributing
   reasons of these the first and most prominent was the depth and
   intensity and genuineness of his love for the netvissa ledda beyond
   all possible things he wanted her; and the proud soul of bothon was
   very grievously racked and torn at the sudden unexpected and arbitrary
   separation from her which the imperial request had brought about

   the voyage from agladdho to ludetka across two sections of the
   globes great oceans and through the ship canals and lakes which
   bisected the southern continent of the western hemisphere occupied
   seven weeks during this period of enforced inaction the bitter chagrin
   and deep disappointment of bothon crystallized itself by means of the
   sustained reflection inevitable under the circumstances general bothon
   arrived in ludekta in a state of mind which made him ready for
   anything provided only it was action this state of mind was the
   second of these contributory factors the third was the immediate
   satisfaction of his desire for activity during the course of his
   voyage home the ghoulish and indeed subhuman factory slaves the
   shockingly simian gyaahau had inaugurated a revolt this had spread
   by the time of bothons arrival throughout the entire province of
   ludekta the state sorely needed the efficient services of this the
   youngest and most brilliant of its generals and his reception on
   landing was more nearly that of a savior of his country than what a
   virtually disgraced diplomat might expect

   into this campaign which he prosecuted with the utmost vigor and a
   thoroughgoing military effectiveness bothon threw himself with an
   abounding energy which even his most ardent ludektan admirers had not
   anticipated at the end of an intensive campaign of less than three
   weeks with this very dangerous revolt completely crushed and the
   leaders of the gyaahua hanging to a man by great hooks through their
   neck muscles in dreadful rows along the outer city walls on either side
   of the great archway that pierced the defense of ludektas capital the
   general bothon found himself the hero of ludekta and the idol of his
   admiring troops a rigid disciplinarian; the attitude of the officers
   and men of the ludektan standing army towards this general had hitherto
   been based upon the respect which his great abilities had always
   commanded now he found himself the recipient of something almost like
   worship because of this last brilliant campaign of his it had been a
   tour de force

   although it is highly probable that they would have advanced him
   because of this achievement in any event the actual occasion for the
   action of the ludektan senate in rewarding bothon with the supreme
   command of the standing army was the speech before that body of the
   aging generalissimo tarba old tarba ended his notable panegyric by
   laying his truncheon emblem of the supreme command on the great
   marble slab before the presiding senator with a dramatic gesture

   bothon thus found himself suddenly possessed of that intensive hero
   worship which would cause the state to acquiesce in anything which its
   object might suggest he was at the same time in supreme command of
   the largest sectional standing army of the entire continent of
   atlantis; an army thanks chiefly to his own efficiency probably the
   best trained and most effective fighting unit then extant

   under the combined effect of the contributing causes and his new
   authority general bothon made up his mind on the eleventh day after
   his triumphal entry into ludektas capital city fortyseven ludektan
   war vessels freshly outfitted their oarslaves supplemented by a
   reserve of the gyaahau selected for the power and endurance of their
   gorillalike bodies with new skin sails throughout the fleet and the
   flower of the ludektan army on board sailed out from ludekta westward
   for alu under the command of the general bothon

   it was precisely simultaneous with the arrival of this war fleet off
   the shores of the great city of alu that there began unprecedented
   natural disturbances affecting the entire area of the mother continent
   these were comparable to nothing recorded in the capitals carefully
   kept slate and parchment records which went back over a period of
   thousands of years

   the first presage of these impending calamities took the form of a
   coppery tinge which replaced the blue of the sky without any warning
   the long groundswell of this western ocean changed abruptly along
   with the color of the water into a kind of dull brickgrey to short
   choppy spraycapped waves these tossed even the great ludektan war
   galleys so violently as to shatter many of the sweeps the wind to the
   consternation of several of bothons captains appeared to come from
   every quarter at once! it tore the heavy skin sails of the ludektan
   galleys away from their copper rings and bolts in some cases in others
   it split the sails in clean straight lines as though they had been slit
   with sharp knives

   undaunted by these manifestations and the reports of his augurs who had
   cast their lots and slain their sheep and fowls in a hasty series of
   divinations to account if possible for this unfavorable reception at
   the hands of the elements the indomitable will of bothon forced his
   fleet to an orderly landing he sent forthwith as his herald to the
   emperor himself his highest ranking subgeneral accompanied by an
   imposing guard of honor on slate tablets bothon had set forth his
   demand in his own hand this was in the form of a set of alternatives
   the emperor was asked to receive him as generalissimo of the military
   forces of ludekta and to consent to his immediate marriage with the
   netvissa ledda; or he bothon would proceed forthwith to the siege of
   alu and take the lady of his heart by force and arms

   the message prayed the emperor to elect the first alternative it also
   set forth briefly and in formal heraldic terms the status of the
   ancient family of bothon

   the emperor had been very seriously annoyed at this challenge as he
   chose to regard it he felt that his office and dignity had been
   outraged he crucified bothons entire delegation

   the siege of alu began forthwith under that menacing coppertinted sky
   and to the accompaniment of a rumbling series of little earthquakes

   not only not within the memory of living men but as the records
   indicated during its entire history over thousands of years as the
   metropolis of the civilized world had there been any previous hostile
   manifestations against the great city of alu that anything like this
   terrible campaign which the renowned general bothon of ludekta set in
   motion against her might come to pass had never even remotely occurred
   to anyone in alu so promptly did bothon launch his attack that the
   tortured bodies of the members of his delegation to the emperor had
   not yet ceased writhing on their row of crosses before he had
   penetrated at the head of his trained legionaries to a point within
   two squares of the imperial palace which stood at the center of the
   great city

   there had been virtually no resistance this intensive campaign would
   have been triumphantly concluded within twenty minutes the emperor
   probably captured along with all his palace guards and household the
   person of the lady ledda secured by this ardent lover of hers and the
   entire objective of the expedition accomplished save for what in
   modern legal phraseology would have been described as an act of god

   the premonitory earthshakings which had accompanied this armed
   invasion culminated at that point in the advance of bothons army in
   a terrific seismic cataclysm the stonepaved streets opened in great
   gaping fissures massive buildings crashed tumultuously all about and
   upon the triumphantly advancing ludektans the general bothon at the
   head of his troops dazed and deafened and hurled violently upon the
   ground retained consciousness long enough to see three quarters of his
   devoted following engulfed smashed torn to fragments crushed into
   unrecognizable heaps of bloody pulp; and this holocaust swiftly and
   mercifully obliterated from before his failing vision by the drifting
   dust from millions of tons of crumbled masonry

   he awakened in the innermost keep of the dungeon in alus citadel

   coming quietly into merediths bedroom about ten oclock in the
   morning dr cowlington who had made up his mind overnight on a
   certain matter quietly led his initial conversation with his
   observationpatient around to the subject which had been most prominent
   in his mind since their conference of yesterday over the strange
   linguistic terms which meredith had noted down

   it has occurred to me that i might very well tell you about something
   quite out of the ordinary which came under my notice seven or eight
   years ago it happened while i was chief intern in the connecticut
   state hospital for the insane i served there for two years under dr
   floyd haviland before i went into private practice we had a few
   private patients in the hospital and one of these who was in my
   particular charge was a gentleman of middleage who had come to us
   because of havilands enormous reputation without commitment this
   gentleman whom i will call `smith was neither legally nor actually
   `insane his difficulty which had interfered very seriously with the
   course of his life and affairs would ordinarily be classified as
   `delusions he was with us for nearly two months as a voluntary
   patient of the institution and being a man of means he had private
   rooms he was in every way normal except for his intensive mental
   preoccupation with what i have called his delusions in daily contact
   with him during this period i became convinced that mr smith was not
   suffering from anything like a delusive affection of the mind

   i diagnosed his difficultyand dr haviland agreed with methat this
   patient smith was suffering mentally from the effects of an ancestral
   memory

   such a case is so rare as to be virtually unique the average
   psychiatrist would go through a lifetime working at his specialty
   without encountering anything of the sort there are however recorded
   cases we were able to send our patient home in a mental condition of
   almost complete normality as sometimes occurs in mental cases his
   virtual cure was accomplished by making our diagnosis very clear to
   himimpressing upon his mind through reiterated and very positive
   statements that he was in no sense of the word demented and that his
   condition while unusual was not outside the range and limitations of
   complete normality

   it must have been a very interesting case said meredith his reply
   was dictated by nothing deeper than a desire to be courteous for his
   mind was full of the affairs of the general bothon raging now in his
   prisonchamber; his mind harried anxious over the fate of his
   surviving soldiers; that lurid glare dimmed by the remoteness of his
   flametinted prisonchamber in his eyes; his mind tortured and his
   keen sense of hearing stultified by the sustained dreadful roaring of
   that implacable sea he meredith for reasons far too deep for his own
   analysis felt utterly incapable of telling dr cowlington what was
   transpiring in those dreams of his all his inmost basic instincts were
   warning him though subconsciously that what he might tell now if he
   would could not possibly be believed! dr cowlington looking at his
   patient saw a face drawn and lined as though from some devastating
   mental stress; a deeply introspective expression in the eyes which
   professionally speaking he did not like the doctor considered a
   moment before resuming erect in his chair his knees crossed his
   fingertips joined in a somewhat judicial attitude

   frankly meredith i emphasized the fact that the man i have called
   smith was in no sense insane because i feel that i must go farther and
   tell you that the nature of his apparent delusions was in one
   striking particular related to your own case i did not wish to give
   you the slightest alarm over the perfect soundness of your own
   mentality! to put the matter plainly mr smith remembered although
   rather vaguely and dimly certain phases of those ancestral memories i
   mentioned and was able to reproduce a number of the terms of some
   unknown and apparently prehistoric language meredith  the doctor
   turned and looked intensely into the eyes of his now interested
   patient there were three or four of smiths words identical with
   yours!

   good god! meredith exclaimed what were the words doctor? did you
   make notes of them?

   yes i have them here answered the psychiatrist

   meredith was out of his chair and leaning eagerly over the doctors
   shoulder long before cowlington had his papers arranged he gazed with
   a consuming intensity at the words and phrases carefully typed on
   several sheets of foolscap; listened with an almost tremulous
   attention while dr cowlington carefully reproduced the sounds of
   these uncouth terms then taking the sheets and resuming his chair he
   read through all that had been written down pronouncing the words
   though very quietly under his breath his lips barely moving

   he was pale and shaking from head to foot when he rose at last and
   handed back hands trembling the thin fascicle of papers to its owner
   dr cowlington looked at him anxiously his professional mind alert
   his fears somewhat aroused over the wisdom of this experiment of his in
   bringing his former case thus abruptly to his patients attention dr
   cowlington felt if he had cared to put his impression into words
   somewhat baffled he could not despite his long and careful training
   in dealing with mental nervous and borderland cases quite put his
   acute professional finger upon just which one of the known simple and
   complex emotions was for this moment dominating this very interesting
   patient of his

   dr cowlington would have been even more completely puzzled if he had
   known

   for meredith reading through the strange babblings of the patient
   smith had recognized all the words and terms and had lit upon the
   phrase:

   our beloved bothon has disappeared

   dr cowlington sensing accurately that it might be unwise to prolong
   this particular interview concluded wisely that meredith would most
   readily regain his normal poise and equanimity if left alone to cope
   with whatever for the timebeing held possession of his mind rose
   quietly and walked over to the bedroom door

   he paused there however for an instant before leaving the room and
   looked back at the man meredith had not apparently so much as noted
   the doctors movements towards departure his mind very obviously was
   turned inward he was it appeared entirely oblivious to his
   surroundings

   and dr cowlington whose professional outward deportment acquired
   through years of contact with abnormal people had not wholly
   obliterated a kindly disposition noted with a certain emotion of his
   own that there were unchecked tears plainly visible in his patients
   inwardgazing eyes

   summoned back to merediths room an hour later by one of his house
   nurses dr cowlington found his patient restored to his accustomer
   urbane normality

   i asked you to come up for a moment doctor began meredith because
   i wanted to inquire if there is anything that you would care to give a
   patient to induce sleep then with a deprecating smile: the only
   such things i know about are morphine and laudanum! i dont know very
   much about medicine and naturally you wouldnt want to give me one of
   those any more than i would want to take it

   dr cowlington resumed his judicial manner he thought rapidly about
   this unexpected request he took into consideration how his story about
   the patient smith had appeared to upset meredith he deliberately
   refrained from inquiring why meredith wanted a sleeping potion then he
   nodded his head

   i use a very simple preparation; he said it is nonhabitforming;
   based on a rather dangerous drug chloral; but as i use it for my
   patients compounded with an aromatic syrup and diluted with half a
   tumbler of water it works very well i will send some up to you but
   remember please four teaspoonfuls of the syrup is the outside dose
   two will probably be enough never more than four at any time and not
   more than one dose in twentyfour hours

   dr cowlington rose came over to meredith and looked at the place
   where he had struck the side of his head against the marble wall of his
   showerbath the bruise was still there the doctor passed his fingers
   lightly over the contusion

   its beginning to go down he remarked then he smiled pleasantly
   again nodded his head at meredith and started to leave meredith
   stopped him as he was about to go out of the room

   i wanted to ask you said meredith i wanted to ask you doctor if
   you would be willing to put me in touch with the man to whom you
   referred as smith?

   the doctor shook his head im sorry mr smith died two years ago

   in ten minutes the house nurse fetched in a small tray on it was a
   tumbler a mixing spoon and a freshly put up eightounce bottle
   containing a reddish colored pleasant tasting syrup

   twenty minutes later meredith who had compromised on three teaspoons
   was deeply asleep on his bed; and the general bothon in the innermost
   dungeon chamber of the great citadel of alu was standing poised in the
   center of that dungeons smooth stone floor tensed to leap in any
   direction; while all about him the rending crashes of thousands of tons
   of the riven and falling masonry of the citadel itself was deafening
   him against all other sounds except the incessant and indescribably
   thunderous fury of the now utterly maddened ocean the lurid glare of
   the tires from without had been markedly heightened detonation after
   detonation came to bothons ears at frequent intervals the aluans were
   blowing up this central portion of their great city in order to check
   the advance of the conflagration which had raged for days and nights
   and was utterly beyond control these detonations seemed actually faint
   to the alert man in that prison room against the hideous crashing of
   the sections of the citadel itself and the sustained roar of the
   ocean

   abruptly the crisis for which he had been waiting arrived the stone
   flooring beneath his feet buckled and sagged at his right he whirled
   about and leaped far in the other direction pressing himself hands
   and arms stretched out above his head against the wall of the
   prisonchamber his heart pounding wildly his breath coming in great
   gasps and sobs as the stifling earthquakedeadened air about him
   shrank to a sudden and devastating attenuation then the solid wall
   opposite split in a tearing gap from top to bottom and an even more
   stifling cloud of white dust sifted abruptly through the room as the
   ceiling was riven asunder

   stifling choking fighting for breath and life the general bothon
   lowered his arms and whirled about again in the direction of this
   thunderous breakage and groped his way across the now precarious
   flooring in the faint hope of discovering an avenue of escape he
   struggled up a steep mound of débris through the grey darkness of the
   hanging dust where a few seconds before there had been a level floor of
   solid masonry he groped his way through thicker clouds of the
   drifting settling stonedust skirted the irregular edges of yawning
   holes and toiled up and down mounded heaps of rubble far past the
   place where the confining wall of his dungeon had stood onward and
   forward resolutely towards that vague goal of freedom

   at last the resources of his mighty body spent his eyes two tortured
   red holes his mouth and throat one searing pain bothon emerged across
   the last hill of rubbish which had been the citadel of alu and came out
   upon the corner edge of one of the largest of the citys great public
   squares

   for the first time in the course of his progress out of that death
   trap bothon suddenly trod on something soft and yielding he paused
   he could hardly see and he crouched and felt with his hands under the
   thickly mounded dust

   it was the body of a man in chain mail bothon exhaled a painful
   breath of satisfaction he rolled the body over freeing it from the
   pounds of dust upon it and slid his hand along the copperstudded
   leather belt to where a short heavy onehanded battleaxe was
   attached this he drew from its sheath

   then from the dead mans silken tunic he tore off a large section and
   cleansed his eyes and mouth and wiped the sweatcaked dust from his
   face

   finally he took from the corpse a heavy leathern purse he lay down for
   a few moments beside the dead soldier on the soft dust for a brief
   rest some ten minutes later he rose stretched himself testing the
   heavy axe with three or four singing strokes through the clearing air
   and dusted out and readjusted his garments finally tightening a
   loosened sandal thong

   he stood free now in the center of alu he was adequately armed a
   great gust of energy surged through him he oriented himself; then he
   turned with an instinct as sure as a homing bees in the direction he
   had been seeking and began to march at the unhurrying spacedevouring
   pace of a ludektan legionary straight for the imperial palace

   bothon had thoroughly settled in his mind the answer to a question
   which for the first few days of his captivity had puzzled him greatly
   why had he been left alone and undisturbed in that confinement; food
   and water brought to him at regular intervals in accordance with the
   ordinary routine of the citadel? why to put the matter plainly having
   been obviously captured by the emperors retainers while lying
   unconscious within two squares of the imperial palace had he not been
   summarily crucified? his keen trained mind had apprised him that the
   answer was to be found in the hideous turmoil of the raging sea and in
   the fearful sounds of a disintegrating city the emperor had been too
   greatly occupied by those cataclysms even to command the punishment of
   this leader of such an armed attack against the worlds metropolis as
   had not been known in all the long history of the mother continent

   skirting its enormous outer walls bothon came at last to the massive
   chief entranceway to the imperial palace this enormous structure its
   basic walls eight feet thick stood massive magnificent intact
   without any hesitation he began mounting the many broad steps straight
   towards the magnificent entrancegates of copper and gold and porphyry

   before these gates in the rigid line and under the command of an
   officer beneath whose corselet appeared the pale blue tunic of the
   emperors householdguards stood a dozen fully armed soldiers one of
   these at a word from the officer ran down the steps to turn back this
   intruder bothon slew him with a single crashing stroke and continued
   to mount the steps at this a shouted command of the officer sent the
   entire troop down the steps upon him in close order bothon paused and
   waiting until the foremost was no more than the space of two of the
   broad steps above him leaped lightly to his right then as the
   foremost four of the soldiers passed beyond him under the impetus of
   their downward charge bothon as lightly leaped back again his heavy
   axe falling upon the troops flank with deadly short quickswinging
   blows

   before they could collect themselves the officer and five of his men
   lay dead upon the steps leaving the demoralized remainder to gather
   themselves together as best they might bothon leaped up the
   intervening steps and was through the great entrancedoors and with a
   pair of lightninglike rightandleft strokes of his axe had disposed
   of the two menatarms stationed just inside the doorway

   his way into the palace now entirely unobstructed bothon sped through
   wellremembered rooms and along broad corridors into the heart of the
   imperial palace of alu

   within thirty seconds he had located the entrance to the brother of the
   emperor netvis toldons apartments and had passed through the
   doorway

   he discovered the family reclining about the horseshoeshaped table in
   the refectory for it was the hour of the evening meal he paused in
   the doorway was met with surprised glances and bowed low to the
   netvis toldon

   i beseech you to pardon this intrusion my lord netvis it would be
   inexcusable under other circumstances at a more favorable time the
   nobleman returned no answer only stared in surprise then the dear
   lady of his heart the netvissa ledda rose to her feet from her place
   at her fathers table her eyes wide with wonderment a dawning
   realization of what this strange invasion might mean made her lovely
   face suddenly the hue of the aluan roses she looked at this heroically
   formed lover of hers her soul in her eyes

   come my lady ledda said bothon quickly and as lightly as a deer the
   netvissa ledda ran to him

   he took her arm very quietly and before the assembled members of the
   family of toldon had recovered from their surprise the two were
   hastening along the corridor towards the palace entrance

   from around the first corner before them came then abrupt sounds of
   armed men they paused listening and bothon shifted his axe into his
   right hand and stepped before the lady ledda but she laid firm hands
   upon his left arm this way swiftly she whispered and led him down
   a narrow passageway at the wide corridors left this they traversed in
   haste and had barely negotiated a sharp turn when they heard the
   guardtroop rush along the main corridor and a voice commanding:

   to the apartment of my lord the netvis toldon!

   the narrow passageway led them past cookrooms and scullerychambers
   and ended at a small door which opened upon a narrow court rapidly
   traversing this they emerged upon a square at the west side of the
   palace and well before any pursuit could have traced their course
   were indistinguishable among the vast concourse of the people who
   thronged the wide avenues of alu

   bothon now resumed the direction of their course of escape leading the
   way across a larger adjacent square he reached the secluded corner
   mounded about with débris where he had secured his weapon it was not
   yet past the early dusk of a midsummer evening and now there was
   nothing to interfere with his keen vision

   yes it was as he had guessed from the quality of that torn fragment of
   silken tunic with which he had wiped his tortured eyes free of the
   stonedust the dead man was an officer of one of the imperial legions

   seating the lady ledda upon a block of granite and requesting her to
   watch bothon knelt swiftly beside the dead body and busied himself
   upon it

   at the end of two intensive minutes the netvissa ledda looked up at his
   touch upon her shoulder to see her lover apparelled from head to foot
   in the uniform armor and accoutrements of an elton of the imperial
   legion of the hawk

   then they hurried southward side by side across the great square with
   its desolation of shattered buildings towards one of the few remaining
   residences of the rich before which four coalblack slaves in the
   livery of their household were lowering an ornamental litter to the
   ground

   from the luxurious vehicle as they arrived beside it there emerged a
   stout citizen who stared at them inquiringly his initial fear
   disappearing at recognition of the emperors niece and the uniform of
   an imperial legion

   we request the loan of your litter my lord said bothon

   most willingly returned the citizen bowing bothon expressed
   thanks handed his companion into the litter distributed a handful of
   silver among the four slaves and gave the destination to the negro who
   stood beside the forward lefthand pole then he climbed in himself and
   drew the red silk curtains together

   the strong litterpoles strained and creaked as the load was hoisted to
   four brawny shoulders and then the litter swung away from the
   residence of its still bowing and smirking owner towards the military
   enclosure which housed and guarded the flyingvessels of the aluvian
   standing army

   you may have observed how very completely i have entrusted my imperial
   person to you remarked the netvissa ledda smiling she was very well
   aware of the reasons for the imperial request which had sent bothon
   back to ludekta and for the first armed invasion against the aluvian
   metropolis

   i have not so much as inquired as to our destination! 

   it is my intention to seek safety to the northwest answered bothon
   gravely i am convinced the prediction of bal lord of fields as to
   the destruction of the mother continent is not a mere classic to be
   learned as we learned it in our childhood as a formal exercise in
   rhetoric here all about us is the evidence more my four augurs
   warned me of the continents danger ere i brought my wargalleys up
   upon the beaches of alu the four great forces they insisted were in
   collusion to that end do we not see and hear them at work? fire raging
   through the land; earth shaking mightily; winds such as never were
   encountered hitherto upon the planet else the old records lie! water
   the commotion of which surpasses all experiences;is it not so my
   beloved? am i not constrained to speak thus to be heard amidst this
   hellish tumult?

   the lady ledda nodded grave now in her turn

   there are many deafened in the palace she remarked where are we to
   go for refuge?

   we depart straight this night for the great mountains of `awahii
   answered bothon if so be the four great forces allow us possession of
   a war chariot and to that end your ring my beloved

   the lady ledda nodded again understandingly and removed from the
   middle finger of her right hand the ring of the two suns and the
   eightpointed star which as a member of the royal family she was
   entitled to wear bothon received it and slipped it upon the little
   finger of his right hand

   the sentinel on guard before the barracks of the officer commanding the
   military enclosure of the aluvian supplybarracks saluted the
   commanding looking elton of the legion of the hawk who stepped down
   from the ornamented litter the elton addressed him in formal military
   phrases

   report at once to the kakalbo netro the arrival of the elton barko
   of the legion of the hawk conveying a member of the imperial household
   into exile i am requisitioning one battlechariot of capacity for two
   persons and officers rations sufficient for fourteen days together
   with the medicinal supply for a full kitva of men my authority the
   imperial signet behold!

   the sentinel saluted the sunandstar ring of the emperor repeated his
   orders like an efficient automaton saluted the elton of the hawk
   legion and departed at the double to fetch the commandant the
   kakalbo netro

   the kakalbo arrived promptly in answer to this summons he saluted the
   imperial signet and as a kakalbo outranked an elton by one full
   grade was punctiliously saluted according to military usage by the
   elton barko of the legion of the hawk an officer whose personal
   acquaintance he had not previously made

   within ten minutes the netvissa ledda had been ceremoniously carried to
   and placed upon her seat in the commandeered battlechariot and the
   elton barko had taken his place beside her then the dozen sweating
   mechanicians who had carried out their commandants orders in record
   time standing in a stiff saluting row the battlechariot started off
   at a stiff gallop the driver standing and plying his long thong with
   loud snapping reports over the horses backs while at the great
   chariots rear the sparehorse leader whistled continuously to the four
   relay animals which galloped behind

   the heights of `awahii to the northwest gave some promise in
   bothons opinion of security from the anciently predicted submersion
   of the continent those towering mountains would at least be among
   the last sections to sink should the gas belts hypothecated by the
   scientists of the mother continent explode and remove the underseas
   support of this great land of the globes most ancient and noble
   civilization

   shortly after daybreak and accurately according to the map and
   careful explanations of the painstaking kakalbo netro the chariot
   paused in the centre of a great level tableland one quarter of the way
   to his destination the country was utterly uninhabited they were
   relatively safe here in a region only lightly visited by the
   earthquakes and not at all by fire the roar of the north wind
   troubled the netvissa ledda severely bothon barely noticed it he was
   now convinced that he was losing his sense of hearing

   they ate and slept and resumed their journey at noon after a
   readjustment of the provisions and a change of the now rested animals

   their four days journey steadily northwest was uneventful the
   charioteer drove onward steadily on the fourth day as the coppery
   ball which was the smoking sun reached and touched a flat horizon they
   caught their first view of the lofty summits of the `awahii region
   a goal of a possible immunity

   dr cowlington an anxious look on his face was standing beside
   merediths bed when he awakened in midmorning he had slept twenty
   hours however what the doctor thought of as his patients mental
   condition was so entirely normal and his cheerfulness so pronounced
   after his protracted sleep that dr cowlington was reassured and
   changed his mind about removing the bottle of sleeping medicine
   plainly it had had an excellent effect on meredith

   stretched out in his usual quietinducing attitude on the davenport
   just before lunch meredith suddenly ceased reading and put down his
   magazine it had occurred to him that he had heard none of the turmoil
   of alu during that waking period he sat up puzzled bothon he
   remembered had been hearing the sounds about him only dimly a
   strange perhaps a significant coincidence

   he felt the bruise behind his right ear it was no longer even slightly
   painful to the touch he pressed his fingertips firmly against the
   place the contusion was now barely perceptible to the sense of touch

   he reported the apparent loss of what the earspecialist gatefield had
   named his clairaudience to dr cowlington after lunch

   your bruise is going down said the doctor significantly he examined
   the posterior edge of merediths right temporal area

   i thought so remarked the doctor nodding your secondary `hearing
   began with that injury to your head as it goes down some obscure
   stimulation of the auditory apparatus which accounts for your ability
   to hear those sounds diminishes accordingly you could probably hear
   only some stupendous sound from there now and in a day or so i predict
   that you will be hearing nothing more and then you can go home!

   and within an hour came the stupendous sound in very truth it broke
   in upon merediths quiet reading once more as though someone had opened
   that soundproof door

   a curious secondary mental vision accompanied it it was as though
   meredith in his own proper person yet through the strange connection
   of his personality with the general bothon stood on the heights of
   tharanyud overlooking the stricken city of alu the utter fury of
   mountainous waves accompanied the now titanic rumblings of malignant
   earth the wholesale crashing of the cyclopean masonry of alu as the
   vast city crumbled and melted beneath his horrified eyes with these
   hellish horrors went the wild roaring of ravaging flame and the
   despairing hysterical cacophony of alus doomed millions

   then there came at last a sound as of the veritable yawning of the
   nethermost watery gulf of earth and the high sun itself was blotted
   out by a monstrous green wall of advancing death the sea rose up and
   fell upon accursed alu drowning forever the shrieks of utter despair
   the piping and chittering of the obscurely gnawing gyaahua distracted
   at last from their loathsome banquethissings roarings shriekings
   whinings tearings seethingsa cacophony more than human ears might
   bear a sight of utter devastation more onerous than man might look
   upon and live

   there came to meredith a merciful stupor as the waters of muiadon
   closed in forever over the mother continent and as his consciousness
   failed him he emerged once more out of that quiet bedroomaway from
   his overlooking of the worlds major catastrophe and as bothon walked
   beside the lady ledda along a wooded ravine in `a o wahii goal of
   safety among laden fruit trees yet not it seemed upon the towering
   heights of those noble mountains but upon an island about the shores of
   which rolled and roared a brown and viscid ocean choked with the mud
   which had been the soil of the mother continent

   we are safe here it would appear my bothon said the netvissa
   ledda let us lie down and sleep for i am very weary

   and after watching for a little space while the lady ledda reclined and
   slept bothon lay down beside her and fell at once into the deep and
   dreamless slumber of utter physical exhaustion

   meredith awakened on his davenport the room was dark and when he had
   risen switched on the lights and looked at his watch he found that it
   was four oclock in the morning he undressed and went to bed and
   awakened three hours later without having dreamed

   a world and an era had come to its cataclysmic end and he had been
   witness of it

   the contusion on his head had disappeared dr cowlington observed
   later in the morning

   i think you can go home now youll never hear again said the
   doctor in his judicial manner but by the way meredith what if
   you can remember was the name of that `mother continent of yours?

   we called it mu said meredith the doctor was silent for a while;
   then he nodded his head he had made up his mind

   i thought so said he gravely

   why? meredith asked

   because smith called it that replied the doctor

   cats and dogs
   by h p lovecraft
   written november 23 1926 published in something about cats and other
   pieces arkham house 1949
   14356cats and dogsh p lovecraft

   being told of the catanddog fight about to occur in your literary
   club i cannot resist contributing a few thomastic yowls and sibilants
   upon my side of the dispute though conscious that the word of a
   venerable exmember can scarcely have much weight against the
   brilliancy of such still active adherents as may bark upon the other
   side aware of my ineptitude at argument a valued correspondent has
   supplied me with the records of a similar controversy in the new york
   tribune in which mr carl van doran is on my side and mr albert
   payson terhune on that of the canine tribe from this i would be glad
   to plagiarise such data as i need; but my friend with genuinely
   machiavellian subtlety has furnished me with only a part of the feline
   section whilst submitting the doggish brief in full no doubt he
   imagines that this arrangement in view of my own emphatic bias makes
   for something like ultimate fairness; but for me it is exceedingly
   inconvenient since it will force me to be more or less original in
   several parts of the ensuing remarks

   between dogs and cats my degree of choice is so great that it would
   never occur to me to compare the two i have no active dislike for
   dogs any more than i have for monkeys human beings tradesmen cows
   sheep or pterodactyls; but for the cat i have entertained a particular
   respect and affection ever since the earliest days of my infancy in
   its flawless grace and superior selfsufficiency i have seen a symbol
   of the perfect beauty and bland impersonality of the universe itself
   objectively considered and in its air of silent mystery there resides
   for me all the wonder and fascination of the unknown the dog appeals
   to cheap and facile emotions; the cat to the deepest founts of
   imagination and cosmic perception in the human mind it is no accident
   that the contemplative egyptians together with such later poetic
   spirits as poe gautier baudelaire and swinburne were all sincere
   worshippers of the supple grimalkin

   naturally ones preference in the matter of cats and dogs depends
   wholly upon ones temperament and point of view the dog would appear
   to me to be the favorite of superficial sentimental and emotional
   people  people who feel rather than think who attach importance to
   mankind and the popular conventional emotions of the simple and who
   find their greatest consolation in the fawning and dependent
   attachments of a gregarious society such people live in a limited
   world of imagination; accepting uncritically the values of common
   folklore and always preferring to have their naive beliefs feelings
   and prejudices tickled rather than to enjoy a purely aesthetic and
   philosophic pleasure arising from discrimination contemplation and
   the recognition of austere absolute beauty this is not to say that
   the cheaper elements do not also reside in the average catlovers love
   of cats but merely to point out that in ailurophily there exists a
   basis of true aestheticism which kynophily does not possess the real
   lover of cats is one who demands a clearer adjustment to the universe
   than ordinary household platitudes provide; one who refuses to swallow
   the sentimental notion that all good people love dogs children and
   horses while all bad people dislike and are disliked by such he is
   unwilling to set up himself and his cruder feelings as a measure of
   universal values or to allow shallow ethical notions to warp his
   judgment in a word he had rather admire and respect than effuse and
   dote; and does not fall into the fallacy that pointless sociability and
   friendliness or slavering devotion and obedience constitute anything
   intrinsically admirable or exalted doglovers base their whole case on
   these commonplace servile and plebeian qualities and amusingly judge
   the intelligence of a pet by its degree of conformity to their own
   wishes catlovers escape this delusion repudiate the idea that
   cringing subservience and sidling companionship to man are supreme
   merits and stand free to worship aristocratic independence
   selfrespect and individual personality joined to extreme grace and
   beauty as typified by the cool lithe cynical and unconquered lord of
   the housetops

   persons of commonplace ideas  unimaginative worthy burghers who are
   satisfied with the daily round of things and who subscribe to the
   popular credo of sentimental values  will always be doglovers to
   them nothing will ever be more important than themselves and their own
   primitive feelings and they will never cease to esteem and glorify the
   fellowanimal who best typifies these such persons are submerged in
   the vortex of oriental idealism and abasement which ruined classic
   civilisation in the dark ages and live in a bleak world of abstract
   sentimental values wherein the mawkish illusions of meekness
   gentleness brotherhood and whining humility are magnified into
   supreme virtues and a whole false ethic and philosophy erected on the
   timid reactions of the flexor system of muscles this heritage
   ironically foisted on us when roman politics raised the faith of a
   whipped and broken people to supremacy in the later empire has
   naturally kept a strong hold over the weak and sentimentally
   thoughtless; and perhaps reached its culmination in the insipid
   nineteenth century when people were wont to praise dogs because they
   are so human (as if humanity were any valid standard of merit!) and
   honest edwin landseer painted hundreds of smug fidoes and carlos and
   rovers with all the anthropoid triviality pettiness and cuteness of
   eminent victorians

   but amidst this chaos of intellectual and emotional groveling a few
   free souls have always stood out for the old civilised realities which
   mediaevalism eclipsed  the stern classic loyalty to truth strength
   and beauty given a clear mind and uncowed spirit to the fullliving
   western aryan confronted by natures majesty loveliness and
   aloofness this is the virile aesthetic and ethic of the extensor
   muscles  the bold buoyant assertive beliefs and preferences of
   proud dominant unbroken and unterrified conquerors hunters and
   warriors  and it has small use for the shams and whimperings of the
   brotherly affection slobbering peacemaker and cringer and
   sentimentalist beauty and sufficiency  twin qualities of the cosmos
   itself  are the gods of this unshackled and pagan type; to the
   worshipper of such eternal things the supreme virtue will not be found
   in lowliness attachment obedience and emotional messiness this sort
   of worshipper will look for that which best embodies the loveliness of
   the stars and the worlds and the forests and the seas and the sunsets
   and which best acts out the blandness lordliness accuracy
   selfsufficiency cruelty independence and contemptuous and
   capricious impersonality of the all governing nature beauty 
   coolness  aloofness  philosophic repose  selfsufficiency 
   untamed mastery  where else can we find these things incarnated with
   even half the perfection and completeness that mark their incarnation
   in the peerless and softly gliding cat which performs its mysterious
   orbit with the relentless and obtrusive certainty of a planet in
   infinity?

   that dogs are dear to the unimaginative peasantburgher whilst cats
   appeal to the sensitive poetaristocrat philosopher will be clear in a
   moment when we reflect on the matter of biological association
   practical plebeian folk judge a thing only by its immediate touch
   taste and smell; while more delicate types form their estimates from
   the linked images and ideas which the object calls up in their minds
   now when dogs and cats are considered the stolid churl sees only the
   two animals before him and bases his favour on their relative capacity
   to pander to his sloppy uniformed ideas of ethics and friendship and
   flattering subservience on the other hand the gentleman and thinker
   sees each in all its natural affiliations and cannot fail to notice
   that in the great symmetries of organic life dogs fall in with slovenly
   wolves and foxes and jackals and coyotes and dingoes and painted
   hyaenas whilst cats walk proudly with the jungles lords and own the
   haughty lion the sinuous leopard the regal tiger and the shapely
   panther and jaguar as their kin dogs are the hieroglyphs of blind
   emotion inferiority servile attachment and gregariousness  the
   attributes of commonplace stupidly passionate and intellectually and
   imaginatively underdeveloped men cats are the runes of beauty
   invincibility wonder pride freedom coldness selfsufficiency and
   dainty individuality  the qualities of sensitive enlightened
   mentally developed pagan cynical poetic philosophic dispassionate
   reserved independent nietzschean unbroken civilised masterclass
   men the dog is a peasant and the cat is a gentleman

   we may indeed judge the tone and bias of a civilisation by its
   relative attitude toward dogs and cats the proud egypt wherein pharaoh
   was pharaoh and pyramids rose in beauty at the wish of him who dreamed
   them bowed down to the cat and temples were built to its goddess at
   bubastis in imperial rome the graceful leopard adorned most homes of
   quality lounging in insolent beauty in the atrium with golden collar
   and chain; while after the age of the antonines the actual cat was
   imported from egypt and cherished as a rare and costly luxury so much
   for the dominant and enlightened peoples when however we come to the
   groveling middle ages with their superstitions and ecstasies and
   monasticisms and maunderings over saints and their relics we find the
   cool and impersonal loveliness of the felidae in very low esteem; and
   behold a sorry spectacle of hatred and cruelty shown toward the
   beautiful little creature whose mousing virtues alone gained it
   sufferance amongst the ignorant churls who resented its selfrespecting
   coolness and feared its cryptical and elusive independence as something
   akin to the dark powers of witchcraft these boorish slaves of eastern
   darkness could not tolerate what did not serve their own cheap emotions
   and flimsy purposes they wished a dog to fawn and hunt and fetch and
   carry and had no use for the cats gift of eternal disinterested
   beauty to feed the spirit one can imagine how they must have resented
   pussys magnificent reposefulness unhurriedness relaxation and scorn
   for trivial human aims and concernments throw a stick and the servile
   dog wheezes and pants and stumbles to bring it to you do the same
   before a cat and he will eye you with coolly polite and somewhat bored
   amusement and just as inferior people prefer the inferior animal which
   scampers excitedly because someone else wants something so do superior
   people respect the superior animal which lives its own life and knows
   that the puerile stickthrowings of alien bipeds are none of its
   business and beneath its notice the dog barks and begs and tumbles to
   amuse you when you crack the whip that pleases a meeknessloving
   peasant who relishes a stimulus to his self importance the cat on the
   other hand charms you into playing for its benefit when it wishes to
   be amused; making you rush about the room with a paper on a string when
   it feels like exercise but refusing all your attempts to make it play
   when it is not in the humour that is personality and individuality and
   selfrespect  the calm mastery of a being whose life is its own and
   not yours  and the superior person recognises and appreciates this
   because he too is a free soul whose position is assured and whose only
   law is his own heritage and aesthetic sense altogether we may see
   that the dog appeals to those primitive emotional souls whose chief
   demands on the universe are for meaningless affection aimless
   companionship and flattering attention and subservience; whilst the
   cat reigns among those more contemplative and imaginative spirits who
   ask of the universe only the objective sight of poignant ethereal
   beauty and the animate symbolisation of natures bland relentless
   reposeful unhurried and impersonal order and sufficiency the dog
   gives but the cat is

   simple folk always overstress the ethical element in life and it is
   quite natural that they should extend it to the realm of their pets
   accordingly we hear many inane dicta in favour of dogs on the ground
   that they are faithful whilst cats are treacherous now just what does
   this really mean? where are the points of reference? certainly the dog
   has so little imagination and individuality that it knows no motives
   but its masters; but what sophisticated mind can descry a positive
   virtue in this stupid abnegation of its birthright? discrimination must
   surely award the palm to the superior cat which has too much natural
   dignity to accept any scheme of things but its own and which
   consequently cares not one whit what any clumsy human thinks or wishes
   or expects of it it is not treacherous because it has never
   acknowledged any allegiance to anything outside its own leisurely
   wishes; and treachery basically implies a departure from some covenant
   explicitly recognised the cat is a realist and no hypocrite he takes
   what pleases him when he wants it and gives no promises he never
   leads you to expect more from him than he gives and if you choose to
   be stupidly victorian enough to mistake his purrs and rubbings of
   selfsatisfaction for marks of transient affection toward you that is
   no fault of his he would not for a moment have you believe that he
   wants more of you than food and warmth and shelter and amusement  and
   he is certainly justified in criticising your aesthetic and imaginative
   development if you fail to find his grace beauty and cheerful
   decorative influence an aboundingly sufficient repayment for all you
   give him the catlover need not be amazed at anothers love for dogs
    indeed he may also possess this quality himself; for dogs are often
   very comely and as lovable in a condescending way as a faithful old
   servant or tenant in the eyes of a master  but he cannot help feeling
   astonished at those who do not share his love for cats the cat is such
   a perfect symbol of beauty and superiority that it seems scarcely
   possible for any true aesthete and civilised cynic to do other than
   worship it we call ourselves a dogs master  but who ever dared
   call himself the master of a cat? we own a dog  he is with us as a
   slave and inferior because we wish him to be but we entertain a cat 
   he adorns our hearth as a guest fellowlodger and equal because he
   wishes to be there it is no compliment to be the stupidly idolised
   master of a dog whose instinct it is to idolise but it is a very
   distinct tribute to be chosen as the friend and confidant of a
   philosophic cat who is wholly his own master and could easily choose
   another companion if he found such a one more agreeable and
   interesting a trace i think of this great truth regarding the higher
   dignity of the cat has crept into folklore in the use of the names
   cat and dog as terms of opprobrium whilst cat has never been
   applied to any sort of offender more than the mildly spiteful and
   innocuously sly female gossip and commentator the words dog and
   cur have always been linked with vileness dishonor and degradation
   of the gravest type in the crystallisation of this nomenclature there
   has undoubtedly been present in the popular mind some dim
   halfunconscious realisation that there are depths of slinking
   whining fawning and servile ignobility which no kith of the lion and
   the leopard could ever attain the cat may fall low but he is always
   unbroken he is like the nordic among men one of those who govern
   their own lives or die

   we have but to glance analytically at the two animals to see the points
   pile up in favour of the cat beauty which is probably the only thing
   of any basic significance in all the cosmos ought to be our chief
   criterion; and here the cat excels so brilliantly that all comparisons
   collapse some dogs it is true have beauty in a very ample degree;
   but even the highest level of canine beauty falls far below the feline
   average the cat is classic whilst the dog is gothic  nowhere in the
   animal world can we discover such really hellenic perfection of form
   with anatomy adapted to function as in the felidae puss is a doric
   temple  an ionic colonnade  in the utter classicism of its
   structural and decorative harmonies and this is just as true
   kinetically as statically for art has no parallel for the bewitching
   grace of the cats slightest motion the sheer perfect aestheticism of
   kittys lazy stretchings industrious facewashings playful rollings
   and little involuntary shiftings in sleep is something as keen and
   vital as the best pastoral poetry or genre painting; whilst the
   unerring accuracy of his leaping and springing running and hunting
   has an artvalue just as high in a more spirited way but it is his
   capacity for leisure and repose which makes the cat preeminent mr
   carl van vechten in peter whiffle holds up the timeless restfulness
   of the cat as a model for lifes philosophy and prof william lyon
   phelps has very effectively captured the secret of felinity when he
   says that the cat does not merely lie down but pours his body out on
   the floor like a glass of water what other creature has thus merged
   the aestheticism of mechanics and hydraulics? contrast this with the
   inept panting wheezing fumbling drooling scratching and general
   clumsiness of the average dog with his false and wasted motions and in
   the details of neatness the fastidious cat is of course immeasurably
   ahead we always love to touch a cat but only the insensitive can
   uniformly welcome the frantic and humid nuzzlings and pawings of a
   dusty and perhaps not inodorous canine which leaps and fusses and
   writhes about in awkward feverishness for no particular reason save
   that blind nervecentres have been spurred by certain meaningless
   stimuli there is a wearying excess of bad manners in all this doggish
   fury  wellbred people dont paw and maul one and surely enough we
   invariably find the cat gentle and reserved in his advances and
   delicate even when he glides gracefully into your lap with cultivated
   purrs or leaps whimsical on the table where you are writing to play
   with your pen in modulated seriocomic pats i do not wonder that
   mahomet that sheik of perfect manners loved cats for their urbanity
   and disliked dogs for their boorishness; or that cats are the favorites
   in the polite latin countries whilst dogs take the lead in heavy
   practical and beerdrinking central europe watch a cat eat and then
   watch a dog the one is held in check by an inherent and inescapable
   daintiness and lends a kind of grace to one of the most ungraceful of
   all processes the dog on the other hand is wholly repulsive in his
   bestial and insatiate greediness; living up to his forest kinship of
   wolfing most openly and unashamedly returning to beauty of line 
   is it not significant that while many normal breeds of dogs are
   conspicuously and admittedly ugly no healthy and welldeveloped feline
   of any species whatsoever is other than beautiful? there are of
   course many ugly cats; but these are always individual cases of
   mongrelism malnutrition deformity or injury no breed of cats in its
   proper condition can by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as
   even slightly ungraceful  a record against which must be pitted the
   depressing spectacle of impossibly flattened bulldogs grotesquely
   elongated dachshunds hideously shapeless and shaggy airedales and
   the like of course it may be said that no aesthetic standard is other
   than relative  but we always work with such standards as we
   empirically have and in comparing cats and dogs under the western
   european aesthetic we cannot be unfair to either if any undiscovered
   tribe in tibet finds airedales beautiful and persian cats ugly we will
   not dispute them on their own territory  but just now we are dealing
   with ourselves and our territory and here the verdict would not admit
   of much doubt even from the most ardent kynophile such an one usually
   passes the problem off in an epigrammatic paradox and says that
   snookums is so homely hes pretty! this is the childish penchant for
   the grotesque and tawdrily cute which we see likewise embodied in
   popular cartoons freak dolls and all the malformed decorative
   trumpery of the billikin or krazy kat order found in the dens and
   cosy corners of the wouldbesophisticated yokelry

   in the matter of intelligence we find the caninites making amusing
   claims  amusing because they so naively measure what they conceive to
   be an animals intelligence by its degree of subservience to the human
   will a dog will retrieve a cat will not; therefore (sic!) the dog is
   the more intelligent dogs can be more elaborately trained for the
   circus and vaudeville acts than cats therefore (o zeus o royal
   mount!) they are cerebrally superior now of course this is all the
   sheerest nonsense we would not call a weakspirited man more
   intelligent than an independent citizen because we can make him vote as
   we wish whereas we cant influence the independent citizen yet
   countless persons apply an exactly parallel argument in appraising the
   grey matter of dogs and cats competition in servility is something to
   which no selfrespecting thomas or tabitha ever stooped and it is
   plain that any really effective estimate of canine and feline
   intelligence must proceed from a careful observation of dogs and cats
   in a detached state  uninfluenced by human beings  as they
   formulate certain objectives of their own and use their own mental
   equipment in achieving them when we do this we arrive at a very
   wholesome respect for our purring hearthside friend who makes so little
   display about his wishes and business methods; for in every conception
   and calculation he shows a steelcold and deliberate union of
   intellect will and sense of proportion which puts utterly to shame
   the emotional sloppingsover and docilely acquired artificial tricks of
   the clever and faithful pointer or sheepdog watch a cat decide to
   move through a door and see how patiently he waits for his
   opportunity never losing sight of his purpose even when he finds it
   expedient to feign other interests in the interim watch him in the
   thick of the chase and compare his calculating patience and quite
   study of his terrain with the noisy floundering and pawing of his
   canine rival it is not often that he returns emptyhanded he knows
   what he wants and means to get it in the most effective way even at
   the sacrifice of time  which he philosophically recognises as
   unimportant in the aimless cosmos there is no turning him aside or
   distracting his attention  and we know that among humans this is the
   quality of mental tenacity this ability to carry a single thread
   through complex distractions is considered a pretty good sign of
   intellectual vigour and maturity children old crones peasants and
   dogs ramble cats and philosophers stick to their point in
   resourcefulness too the cat attests his superiority dogs can be well
   trained to do a single thing but psychologists tell us that these
   responses to an automatic memory instilled from outside are of little
   worth as indices of real intelligence to judge the abstract
   development of a brain confront it with new and unfamiliar conditions
   and see how well its own strength enables it to achieve its object by
   sheer reasoning without blazed trails here the cats can silently
   devise a dozen mysterious and successful alternatives whilst poor fido
   is barking in bewilderment and wondering what it is all about granted
   that rover the retriever may make a greater bid for popular sentimental
   regard by going into the burning house and saving the baby in
   traditional cinema fashion it remains a fact that whiskered and
   purring nig is a highergrade biological organism  something
   physiologically and psychologically nearer a man because of his very
   freedom from mans orders and as such entitled to a higher respect
   from those who judge by purely philosophic and aesthetic standards we
   can respect a cat as we cannot respect a dog no matter which
   personally appeals the more to our mere doting fancy; and if we be
   aesthetes and analysts rather than commonplacelovers and
   emotionalists the scales must inevitably turn completely in kittys
   favour

   it may be added moreover that even the aloof and sufficient cat is by
   no means devoid of sentimental appeal once we get rid of the
   uncivilised ethical bias  the treacherous and horrid birdcatcher
   prejudice  we find in the harmless cat the very apex of happy
   domestic symbolism; whilst small kittens become objects to adore
   idealise and celebrate in the most rhapsodic of dactyls and anapaests
   iambics and trochaics i in my own senescent mellowness confess to an
   inordinate and wholly unphilosophic predilection for tiny coalblack
   kittens with large yellow eyes and could no more pass one without
   petting him than dr johnson could pass a sidewalk post without
   striking it there is likewise in many cats quite analogous to the
   reciprocal fondness so loudly extolled in dogs human beings horses
   and the like cats come to associate certain persons with acts
   continuously contributing to their pleasure and acquire for them a
   recognition and attachment which manifests itself in pleasant
   excitement at their approach  whether or not bearing food and drink
    and a certain pensiveness at their protracted absence a cat with
   whom i was on intimate terms reached the point of accepting food from
   no hand but one and would actually go hungry rather than touch the
   least morsel from a kindly neighbour source he also had distinct
   affections amongst the other cats of that idyllic household;
   voluntarily offering food to one of his whiskered friends whilst
   disputing most savagely the least glance which his coalblack rival
   snowball would bestow upon his plate if it be argued that these
   feline fondnesses are essentially selfish and practical in their
   ultimate composition let us inquire in return how many human
   fondnesses apart from those springing directly upon primitive brute
   instinct have any other basis after the returning board has brought
   in the grand total of zero we shall be better able to refrain from
   ingenuous censure of the selfish cat

   the superior imaginative inner life of the cat resulting in superior
   selfpossession is well known a dog is a pitiful thing depending
   wholly on companionship and utterly lost except in packs or by the
   side of his master leave him alone and he does not know what to do
   except bark and howl and trot about till sheer exhaustion forces him to
   sleep a cat however is never without the potentialities of
   contentment like a superior man he knows how to be alone and happy
   once he looks about and finds no one to amuse him he settles down to
   the task of amusing himself; and no one really knows cats without
   having occasionally peeked stealthily at some lively and well balanced
   kitten which believes itself to be alone only after such a glimpse of
   unaffected tailchasing grace and unstudied purring can one fully
   understand the charm of those lines which coleridge wrote with
   reference to the human rather than the feline young  page eleven
    a limber elf
   singing dancing to itself

   but whole volumes could be written on the playing of cats since the
   varieties and aesthetic aspects of such sportiveness are infinite be
   it sufficient to say that in such pastimes cats have exhibited traits
   and actions which psychologists authentically declare to be motivated
   by genuine humour and whimsicality in its purest sense; so that the
   task of making a cat laugh may not be so impossible a thing even
   outside the borders of cheshire in short a dog is an incomplete
   thing like an inferior man he needs emotional stimuli from outside
   and must set something artificial up as a god and motive the cat
   however is perfect in himself like the human philosopher he is a
   self sufficient entity and microcosm he is a real and integrated
   being because he thinks and feels himself to be such whereas the dog
   can conceive of himself only in relation to something else whip a dog
   and he licks your hand frauth! the beast has no idea of himself except
   as an inferior part of an organism whereof you are the superior part 
   he would no more think of striking back at you than you would think of
   pounding your own head when it punishes you with a headache but whip a
   cat and watch it glare and move backward hissing in outraged dignity
   and selfrespect! one more blow and it strikes you in return; for it
   is a gentleman and your equal and will accept no infringement on its
   personality and body of privileges it is only in your house anyway
   because it wishes to be or perhaps even as a condescending favour to
   yourself it is the house not you it likes; for philosophers realise
   that human beings are at best only minor adjuncts to scenery go one
   step too far and it leaves you altogether you have mistaken your
   relationship to it and imagined you are its master and no real cat can
   tolerate that breach of good manners henceforward it will seek
   companions of greater discrimination and clearer perspective let
   anaemic persons who believe in turning the other cheek console
   themselves with cringing dogs  for the robust pagan with the blood of
   nordic twilights in his veins there is no beast like the cat; intrepid
   steed of freya who can boldly look even thor and odin full in the face
   and stare with great round eyes of undimmed yellow or green

   in these observations i believe i have outlined with some fullness the
   diverse reasons why in my opinion and in the smartly timed
   titlephrase of mr van doren gentlemen prefer cats the reply of
   mrterhune in a subsequent issue of the tribune appears to me beside
   the point; insomuch as it is less a refutation of facts than a mere
   personal affirmation of the authors membership in that conventional
   very human majority who take affection and companionship seriously
   enjoy being important to something alive hate a parasite on mere
   ethical ground without consulting the right of beauty to exist for ½its
   own sake and therefore love mans noblest and most faithful friend
   the perennial dog i suppose mrterhune loves horses and babies also
   for the three go conventionally together in the great
   hundredpercenters credo as highly essential likings for every good
   and lovable heman of the arrow collar and harold bell wright hero
   school even though the automobile and margaret sanger have done much
   to reduce the last two items

   dogs then are peasants and the pets of peasants cats are gentlemen
   and the pets of gentlemen the dog is for him who places crude feeling
   and outgrown ethic and humanocentricity above austere and disinterested
   beauty; who just loves folks and folksiness and doesnt mind sloppy
   clumsiness if only something will truly care for him (tableau of dog
   across masters grave  cf lanseer the old shepherds chief
   mourner) the guy who isnt much for highbrow stuff but is always on
   the square and dont (sic) often find the saddypost or the ny world
   too deep for him; who hadnt much use for valentino but thinks doug
   fairbanks is just about right for an evenings entertainment wholesome
    constructive  nonmorbid  civicminded  domestic  (i forgot
   to mention the radio) normal  thats the sort of gogetter that ought
   to go in for dogs

   the cat is for the aristocrat  whether by birth or inclinations or
   both  who admires his fellowaristocrats he is for the man who
   appreciates beauty as the one living force in a blind and purposeless
   universe and who worships that beauty in all its forms without regard
   for the sentimental and ethical illusions of the moment for the man
   who knows the hollowness of feeling and the emptiness of human objects
   and aspirations and who therefore clings solely to what is real  as
   beauty is real because it pretends to a significance beyond the emotion
   which it excites and is for the man who feels sufficient in the
   cosmos and asks no scruples of conventional prejudice but loves
   repose and strength and freedom and luxury and sufficiency and
   contemplation; who as a strong fearless soul wishes something to
   respect instead of something to lick his face and accept his alternate
   blows and strokings; who seeks a proud and beautiful equal in the
   peerage of individualism rather than a cowed and cringing satellite in
   the hierarchy of fear subservience and devolution the cat is not for
   the brisk selfimportant little worker with a mission  but for the
   enlightened dreaming poet who knows that the world contains nothing
   really worth doing the dilettante  the connoisseur  the decadent
   if you will though in a healthier age than this there were things for
   such men to do so that they were the planners and leader of those
   glorious pagan times the cat is for him who does things not for empty
   duty but for power pleasure splendour romance and glamour  for
   the harpist who sings alone in the night of old battles or the warrior
   who goes out to fight such battles for beauty glory fame and the
   splendour of a land athwart which no shadow of weakness falls for him
   who will be lulled by no sops of prose and usefulness but demands for
   his comfort the ease and beauty and ascendancy and cultivation which
   make effort worth while for the man who knows that play not work and
   leisure not bustle are the great things of life; and that the round
   of striving merely in order to strive some more is a bitter irony of
   which the civilised soul accepts as little as it can

   beauty sufficiency ease and good manners  what more can
   civilisation require? we have them all in the divine monarch who
   lounges gloriously on his silken cushion before the hearth loveliness
   and joy for their own sake  pride and harmony and coordination 
   spirit restfulness and completeness  all here are present and need
   but a sympathetic disillusionment for worship in full measure what
   fully civilised soul but would eagerly serve as high priest of bast?
   the star of the cat i think is just now in the ascendant as we
   emerge little by little from the dreams of ethics and conformity which
   clouded the nineteenth century and raised the grubbing and unlovely dog
   to the pinnacle of sentimental regard whether a renaissance of power
   and beauty will restore our western civilisation or whether the forces
   of disintegration are already too powerful for any hand to check none
   may yet say but in the present moment of cynical worldunmasking
   between the pretence of the eighteenhundreds and the ominous mystery
   of the decades ahead we have at least a flash of the old pagan
   perspective and the old pagan clearness and honesty

   and one idol lit up by that flash seen fair and lovely on a
   dreamthrone of silk and gold under a chryselephantine dome is a shape
   of deathless grace not always given its due among groping mortals 
   the haughty the unconquered the mysterious the luxurious the
   babylonian the impersonal the eternal companion of superiority and
   art  the type of perfect beauty and the brother of poetry  the
   bland grave compliant and patrician cat

   in a dream kuranes saw the city in the valley and the seacoast beyond
   and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted galleys
   that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets
   the sky in a dream it was also that he came by his name of kuranes
   for when awake he was called by another name
         perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name; for he was
   the last of his family and alone among the indifferent millions of
   london so there were not many to speak to him and to remind him who he
   had been his money and lands were gone and he did not care for the
   ways of the people about him but preferred to dream and write of his
   dreams what he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he showed it so
   that after a time he kept his writings to himself and finally ceased
   to write
         the more he withdrew from the world about him the more wonderful
   became his dreams; and it would have been quite futile to try to
   describe them on paper kuranes was not modern and did not think like
   others who wrote whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered
   robes of myth and to show in naked ugliness the foul thing that is
   reality kuranes sought for beauty alone when truth and experience
   failed to reveal it he sought it in fancy and illusion and found it
   on his very doorstep amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and
   dreams
         there are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to
   them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we
   listen and dream we think but halfformed thoughts and when as men we
   try to remember we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life but
   some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills
   and gardens of fountains that sing in the sun of golden cliffs
   overhanging murmuring seas of plains that stretch down to sleeping
   cities of bronze and stone and of shadowy companies of heroes that
   ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests; and
   then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that
   world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappy
         kuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood he
   had been dreaming of the house where he had been born; the great stone
   house covered with ivy where thirteen generations of his ancestors had
   lived and where he had hoped to die it was moonlight and he had
   stolen out into the fragrant summer night through the gardens down
   the terraces past the great oaks of the park and along the long white
   road to the village the village seemed very old eaten away at the
   edge like the moon which had commenced to wane and kuranes wondered
   whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death in the
   streets were spears of long grass and the windowpanes on either side
   broken or filmily staring kuranes had not lingered but had plodded on
   as though summoned toward some goal he dared not disobey the summons
   for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of
   waking life which do not lead to any goal then he had been drawn down
   a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs
   and had come to the end of things to the precipice and the abyss where
   all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing
   emptiness of infinity and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit
   by the crumbling moon and the peering stars faith had urged him on
   over the precipice and into the gulf where he had floated down down
   down; past dark shapeless undreamed dreams faintly glowing spheres
   that may have been partly dreamed dreams and laughing winged things
   that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds then a rift seemed
   to open in the darkness before him and he saw the city of the valley
   glistening radiantly far far below with a background of sea and sky
   and a snowcapped mountain near the shore
         kuranes had awakened the very moment he beheld the city yet he
   knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephaïs in
   the valley of oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where his spirit
   had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long
   ago when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm seabreeze
   lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the
   village he had protested then when they had found him waked him and
   carried him home for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail
   in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the
   sky and now he was equally resentful of awaking for he had found his
   fabulous city after forty weary years
         but three nights afterward kuranes came again to celephaïs as
   before he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead and of
   the abyss down which one must float silently; then the rift appeared
   again and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city and saw the
   graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour and watched the
   gingko trees of mount aran swaying in the seabreeze but this time he
   was not snatched away and like a winged being settled gradually over a
   grassy hillside til finally his feet rested gently on the turf he had
   indeed come back to the valley of oothnargai and the splendid city of
   celephaïs
         down the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked
   kuranes over the bubbling naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he
   had carved his name so many years ago and through the whispering grove
   to the great stone bridge by the city gate all was as of old nor were
   the marble walls discoloured nor the polished bronze statues upon them
   tarnished and kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he
   knew be vanished; for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same
   and still as young as he remembered them when he entered the city
   past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements the merchants and
   cameldrivers greeted him as if he had never been away; and it was the
   same at the turquoise temple of nathhorthath where the
   orchidwreathed priests told him that there is no time in oothnargai
   but only perpetual youth then kuranes walked through the street of
   pillars to the seaward wall where gathered the traders and sailors
   and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky there he
   stayed long gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples
   sparkled beneath an unknown sun and where rode lightly the galleys
   from far places over the water and he gazed also upon mount aran
   rising regally from the shore its lower slopes green with swaying
   trees and its white summit touching the sky
         more than ever kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far
   places of which he had heard so many strange tales and he sought again
   the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago he found the man
   athib sitting on the same chest of spice he had sat upon before and
   athib seemed not to realize that any time had passed then the two
   rowed to a galley in the harbour and giving orders to the oarmen
   commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenarian sea that leads to the
   sky for several days they glided undulatingly over the water till
   finally they came to the horizon where the sea meets the sky here the
   galley paused not at all but floated easily in the blue of the sky
   among fleecy clouds tinted with rose and far beneath the keel kuranes
   could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty
   spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or
   disappear at length athib told him that their journey was near its
   end and that they would soon enter the harbour of serannian the pink
   marble city of the clouds which is built on that ethereal coast where
   the west wind flows into the sky; but as the highest of the citys
   carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space and
   kuranes awaked in his london garret
         for many months after that kuranes sought the marvellous city of
   celephaïs and its skybound galleys in vain; and though his dreams
   carried him to many gorgeous and unheardof places no one whom he met
   could tell him how to find oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills one
   night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint lone
   campfires at great distances apart and strange shaggy herds with
   tinkling bells on the leaders and in the wildest part of this hilly
   country so remote that few men could ever have seen it he found a
   hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges
   and valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands and of
   such a length that neither end of it could be seen beyond that wall in
   the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees and
   when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers green
   foliage and lawns white paths diamond brooks blue lakelets carven
   bridges and redroofed pagodas that he for a moment forgot celephaïs
   in sheer delight but he remembered it again when he walked down a
   white path toward a redroofed pagoda and would have questioned the
   people of this land about it had he not found that there were no
   people there but only birds and bees and butterflies on another night
   kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly and came to a
   tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon;
   and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought
   he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before he
   would have descended and asked the way to oothnargai had not a
   fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon
   showing the ruin and antiquity of the city and the stagnation of the
   reedy river and the death lying upon that land as it had lain since
   king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of
   the gods
         so kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of
   celephaïs and its galleys that sail to serannian in the sky meanwhile
   seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the highpriest not
   to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and
   dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery in the cold desert
   plateau of leng in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of
   day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of
   sleep hasheesh helped a great deal and once sent him to a part of
   space where form does not exist but where glowing gases study the
   secrets of existence and a violetcoloured gas told him that this part
   of space was outside what he had called infinity the gas had not heard
   of planets and organisms before but identified kuranes merely as one
   from the infinity where matter energy and gravitation exist kuranes
   was now very anxious to return to minaretstudded celephaïs and
   increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more money left
   and could buy no drugs then one summer day he was turned out of his
   garret and wandered aimlessly through the streets drifting over a
   bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner and it was
   there that fulfillment came and he met the cortege of knights come
   from celephaïs to bear him thither forever
         handsome knights they were astride roan horses and clad in
   shining armour with tabards of clothofgold curiously emblazoned so
   numerous were they that kuranes almost mistook them for an army but
   they were sent in his honour; since it was he who had created
   oothnargai in his dreams on which account he was now to be appointed
   its chief god for evermore then they gave kuranes a horse and placed
   him at the head of the cavalcade and all rode majestically through the
   downs of surrey and onward toward the region where kuranes and his
   ancestors were born it was very strange but as the riders went on
   they seemed to gallop back through time; for whenever they passed
   through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and
   villagers as chaucer or men before him might have seen and sometimes
   they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers when
   it grew dark they travelled more swiftly till soon they were flying
   uncannily as if in the air in the dim dawn they came upon the village
   which kuranes had seen alive in his childhood and asleep or dead in
   his dreams it was alive now and early villagers curtsied as the
   horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that
   ends in the abyss of dreams kuranes had previously entered that abyss
   only at night and wondered what it would look like by day; so he
   watched anxiously as the column approached its brink just as they
   galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came
   somewhere out of the west and hid all the landscape in effulgent
   draperies the abyss was a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean
   splendour and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly
   entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past
   glittering clouds and silvery coruscations endlessly down the horsemen
   floated their chargers pawing the aether] as if galloping over golden
   sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater
   brightness the brightness of the city celephaïs and the sea coast
   beyond and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted
   galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the
   sea meets the sky
         and kuranes reigned thereafter over oothnargai and all the
   neighboring regions of dream and held his court alternately in
   celephaïs and in the cloudfashioned serannian he reigns there still
   and will reign happily for ever though below the cliffs at innsmouth
   the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had
   stumbled through the halfdeserted village at dawn; played mockingly
   and cast it upon the rocks by ivycovered trevor towers where a
   notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the
   purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility

   dam bor glued each of his six eyes to the lenses of the cosmoscope his
   nasal tentacles were orange with fear and his antennae buzzed hoarsely
   as he dictated his report to the operator behind him it has come! he
   cried that blur in the ether can be nothing less than a fleet from
   outside the spacetime continuum we know nothing like this has ever
   appeared before it must be an enemy give the alarm to the
   intercosmic chamber of commerce theres no time to loseat this rate
   theyll be upon us in less than six centuries hak ni must have a
   chance to get the fleet in action at once i glanced up from the windy
   city grabbag which had beguiled my inactive peacetime days in the
   supergalactic patrol the handsome young vegetable with whom i shared
   my bowl of caterpillar custard since earliest infancy and with whom i
   had been thrown out of every joint in the intradimensional city of
   kastorya had really a worried look upon his lavender face after he
   had given the alarm we jumped on our etherbikes and hastened across to
   the outer planet on which the chamber held its sessions within the
   great council chamber which measured twentyeight square feet (with
   quite a high ceiling) were gathered delegates from all the
   thirtyseven galaxies of our immediate universe oll stof president of
   the chamber and representative of the milliners soviet raised his
   eyeless snout with dignity and prepared to address the assembled
   multitude he was a highly developed protozoan organism from novkas
   and spoke by emitting alternate waves of heat and cold gentlemen he
   radiated a terrible peril has come upon us which i feel i must bring
   to your attention everybody applauded riotously as a wave of
   excitement rippled through the variegated audience; those who were
   handless slithering their tentacles together he continued: hak ni
   crawl upon the dais! there was a thunderous silence during which a
   faint prompting was heard from the dizzy summit of the platform hak
   ni the yellowfurred and valorous commander of our ranks through
   numerous installments ascended to the towering peak inches above the
   floor my friends he began with an eloquent scraping of his
   posterior limbs these treasured walls and pillars shall not mourn on
   my account at this point one of his numerous relatives cheered
   well do i remember when oll stof interrupted him you have
   anticipated my thoughts and orders go forth and win for dear old
   intercosmic two paragraphs later found us soaring out past
   innumerable stars toward where a faint blur half a million lightyears
   long marked the presence of the hated enemy whom we had not seen what
   monsters of malformed grotesqueness seethed out there among the moons
   of infinity we really didnt know but there was a malign menace in
   the glow that steadily increased until it spanned the entire heavens
   very soon we made out separate objects in the blur before all my
   horrorstricken visionareas there spread an endless array of
   scissorsshaped spaceships of totally unfamiliar form then from the
   direction of the enemy there came a terrifying sound which i soon
   recognised as a hail and a challenge an answering thrill crept through
   me as i met with uplifted antennae this threat of battle with a
   monstrous intrusion upon our fair system from unknown outside abysses
   at the sound which was something like that of a rusty sewingmachine
   only more horrible hak ni too raised his snout in defiance radiating
   a masterful order to the captains of the fleet instantly the huge
   spaceships swung into battle formation with only a hundred or two of
   them many lightyears out of line

   cool air
   by hp lovecraft

    cool air is a short story by the american horror fiction writer h p
   lovecraft written in march 1926 and published in the march 1928 issue
   of tales of magic and mystery  excerpted from cool air on wikipedia
                           the free encyclopedia

   8394cool airhp lovecraft

   you ask me to explain why i am afraid of a draught of cool air; why i
   shiver more than others upon entering a cold room and seem nauseated
   and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a
   mild autumn day there are those who say i respond to cold as others do
   to a bad odour and i am the last to deny the impression what i will
   do is to relate the most horrible circumstance i ever encountered and
   leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable
   explanation of my peculiarity

   it is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with
   darkness silence and solitude i found it in the glare of
   midafternoon in the clangour of a metropolis and in the teeming
   midst of a shabby and commonplace roominghouse with a prosaic landlady
   and two stalwart men by my side in the spring of 1923 i had secured
   some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of new york; and
   being unable to pay any substantial rent began drifting from one cheap
   boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might
   combine the qualities of decent cleanliness endurable furnishings and
   very reasonable price it soon developed that i had only a choice
   between different evils but after a time i came upon a house in west
   fourteenth street which disgusted me much less than the others i had
   sampled

   the place was a fourstory mansion of brownstone dating apparently
   from the late forties and fitted with woodwork and marble whose
   stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of
   tasteful opulence in the rooms large and lofty and decorated with
   impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices there
   lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the
   floors were clean the linen tolerably regular and the hot water not
   too often cold or turned off so that i came to regard it as at least a
   bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again the
   landlady a slatternly almost bearded spanish woman named herrero did
   not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the lateburning
   electric light in my thirdfloor front hall room; and my fellowlodgers
   were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire being mostly
   spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade only the din
   of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance

   i had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident
   occurred one evening at about eight i heard a spattering on the floor
   and became suddenly aware that i had been smelling the pungent odour of
   ammonia for some time looking about i saw that the ceiling was wet
   and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the
   side toward the street anxious to stop the matter at its source i
   hastened to the basement to tell the landlady; and was assured by her
   that the trouble would quickly be set right

   doctair muñoz she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me he have
   speel hees chemicals he ees too seeck for doctair heemselfseecker
   and seecker all the timebut he weel not have no othair for help he
   ees vairy queer in hees seecknessall day he take funneesmelling
   baths and he cannot get excite or warm all hees own housework he
   dohees leetle room are full of bottles and machines and he do not
   work as doctair but he was great oncemy fathair in barcelona have
   hear of heemand only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get
   hurt of sudden he nevair go out only on roof and my boy esteban he
   breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals my gawd
   the salammoniac that man use for keep heem cool!

   mrs herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor and i
   returned to my room the ammonia ceased to drip and as i cleaned up
   what had spilled and opened the window for air i heard the landladys
   heavy footsteps above me dr muñoz i had never heard save for certain
   sounds as of some gasolinedriven mechanism; since his step was soft
   and gentle i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this
   man might be and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not
   the result of a rather baseless eccentricity there is i reflected
   tritely an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person
   who has come down in the world

   i might never have known dr muñoz had it not been for the heart attack
   that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room
   physicians had told me of the danger of those spells and i knew there
   was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said about
   the invalids help of the injured workman i dragged myself upstairs
   and knocked feebly at the door above mine my knock was answered in
   good english by a curious voice some distance to the right asking my
   name and business; and these things being stated there came an opening
   of the door next to the one i had sought

   a rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the
   hottest of late june i shivered as i crossed the threshold into a
   large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this
   nest of squalor and seediness a folding couch now filled its diurnal
   role of sofa and the mahogany furniture sumptuous hangings old
   paintings and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentlemans study
   rather than a boardinghouse bedroom i now saw that the hall room
   above minethe leetle room of bottles and machines which mrs
   herrero had mentionedwas merely the laboratory of the doctor; and
   that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose
   convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide
   all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices dr muñoz most
   certainly was a man of birth cultivation and discrimination

   the figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned and clad
   in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit a highbred face of
   masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short
   irongrey full beard and an oldfashioned pincenez shielded the full
   dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a moorish touch to
   a physiognomy otherwise dominantly celtiberian thick welltrimmed
   hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully
   above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking
   intelligence and superior blood and breeding

   nevertheless as i saw dr muñoz in that blast of cool air i felt a
   repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify only his lividly
   inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a
   physical basis for this feeling and even these things should have been
   excusable considering the mans known invalidism it might too have
   been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was
   abnormal on so hot a day and the abnormal always excites aversion
   distrust and fear

   but repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration for the strange
   physicians extreme skill at once became manifest despite the
   icecoldness and shakiness of his bloodlesslooking hands he clearly
   understood my needs at a glance and ministered to them with a masters
   deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly
   hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies
   to death and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a
   lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and
   extirpation something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in
   him and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and
   mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory
   room evidently he found the society of a wellborn man a rare novelty
   in this dingy environment and was moved to unaccustomed speech as
   memories of better days surged over him

   his voice if queer was at least soothing; and i could not even
   perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out
   he sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his
   theories and experiments; and i remember his tactfully consoling me
   about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are
   stronger than organic life itself so that if a bodily frame be but
   originally healthy and carefully preserved it may through a scientific
   enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation
   despite the most serious impairments defects or even absences in the
   battery of specific organs he might he half jestingly said some day
   teach me to liveor at least to possess some kind of conscious
   existencewithout any heart at all! for his part he was afflicted
   with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which
   included constant cold any marked rise in temperature might if
   prolonged affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his
   habitationsome 55 or 56 degrees fahrenheitwas maintained by an
   absorption system of ammonia cooling the gasoline engine of whose
   pumps i had often heard in my own room below

   relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while i left the
   shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse after that
   i paid him frequent overcoated calls; listening while he told of secret
   researches and almost ghastly results and trembling a bit when i
   examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his
   shelves i was eventually i may add almost cured of my disease for
   all time by his skillful ministrations it seems that he did not scorn
   the incantations of the mediaevalists since he believed these cryptic
   formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably
   have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which
   organic pulsations had fled i was touched by his account of the aged
   dr torres of valencia who had shared his earlier experiments and
   nursed him through the great illness of eighteen years before whence
   his present disorders proceeded no sooner had the venerable
   practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim
   enemy he had fought perhaps the strain had been too great; for dr
   muñoz made it whisperingly clearthough not in detailthat the
   methods of healing had been most extraordinary involving scenes and
   processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative galens

   as the weeks passed i observed with regret that my new friend was
   indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically as mrs
   herrero had suggested the livid aspect of his countenance was
   intensified his voice became more hollow and indistinct his muscular
   motions were less perfectly coordinated and his mind and will
   displayed less resilience and initiative of this sad change he seemed
   by no means unaware and little by little his expression and
   conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me
   something of the subtle repulsion i had originally felt

   he developed strange caprices acquiring a fondness for exotic spices
   and egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a
   sepulchred pharaoh in the valley of kings at the same time his demands
   for cold air increased and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping
   of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating
   machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34 degrees or 40
   degrees and finally even 28 degrees; the bathroom and laboratory of
   course being less chilled in order that water might not freeze and
   that chemical processes might not be impeded the tenant adjoining him
   complained of the icy air from around the connecting door so i helped
   him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty a kind of growing
   horror of outré and morbid cast seemed to possess him he talked of
   death incessantly but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or
   funeral arrangements were gently suggested

   all in all he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet
   in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the
   strangers around him and was careful to dust his room and attend to
   his needs each day muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially
   for the purpose i likewise did much of his shopping and gasped in
   bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and
   laboratory supply houses

   an increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around
   his apartment the whole house as i have said had a musty odour; but
   the smell in his room was worseand in spite of all the spices and
   incense and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he
   insisted on taking unaided i perceived that it must be connected with
   his ailment and shuddered when i reflected on what that ailment might
   be mrs herrero crossed herself when she looked at him and gave him
   up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son esteban continue to run
   errands for him when i suggested other physicians the sufferer would
   fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain he
   evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion yet his will
   and driving force waxed rather than waned and he refused to be
   confined to his bed the lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place
   to a return of his fiery purpose so that he seemed about to hurl
   defiance at the deathdaemon even as that ancient enemy seized him the
   pretence of eating always curiously like a formality with him he
   virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from
   total collapse

   he acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort which he
   carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that i transmit them after
   his death to certain persons whom he namedfor the most part lettered
   east indians but including a once celebrated french physician now
   generally thought dead and about whom the most inconceivable things
   had been whispered as it happened i burned all these papers
   undelivered and unopened his aspect and voice became utterly
   frightful and his presence almost unbearable one september day an
   unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had
   come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed
   effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight that man oddly
   enough had been through the terrors of the great war without having
   incurred any fright so thorough

   then in the middle of october the horror of horrors came with
   stupefying suddenness one night about eleven the pump of the
   refrigerating machine broke down so that within three hours the
   process of ammonia cooling became impossible dr muñoz summoned me by
   thumping on the floor and i worked desperately to repair the injury
   while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless rattling hollowness
   surpassed description my amateur efforts however proved of no use;
   and when i had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring allnight
   garage we learned that nothing could be done till morning when a new
   piston would have to be obtained the moribund hermits rage and fear
   swelling to grotesque proportions seemed likely to shatter what
   remained of his failing physique and once a spasm caused him to clap
   his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom he groped his way out
   with face tightly bandaged and i never saw his eyes again

   the frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing and at
   about 5 am the doctor retired to the bathroom commanding me to keep
   him supplied with all the ice i could obtain at allnight drug stores
   and cafeterias as i would return from my sometimes discouraging trips
   and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door i could hear a
   restless splashing within and a thick voice croaking out the order for
   moremore! at length a warm day broke and the shops opened one by
   one i asked esteban either to help with the icefetching whilst i
   obtained the pump piston or to order the piston while i continued with
   the ice; but instructed by his mother he absolutely refused

   finally i hired a seedylooking loafer whom i encountered on the corner
   of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little
   shop where i introduced him and applied myself diligently to the task
   of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it
   the task seemed interminable and i raged almost as violently as the
   hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless foodless round
   of vain telephoning and a hectic quest from place to place hither and
   thither by subway and surface car about noon i encountered a suitable
   supply house far downtown and at approximately 1:30 pm arrived at my
   boardingplace with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and
   intelligent mechanics i had done all i could and hoped i was in time

   black terror however had preceded me the house was in utter turmoil
   and above the chatter of awed voices i heard a man praying in a deep
   basso fiendish things were in the air and lodgers told over the beads
   of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctors
   closed door the lounger i had hired it seems had fled screaming and
   madeyed not long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result
   of excessive curiosity he could not of course have locked the door
   behind him; yet it was now fastened presumably from the inside there
   was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow thick dripping

   briefly consulting with mrs herrero and the workmen despite a fear
   that gnawed my inmost soul i advised the breaking down of the door;
   but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some
   wire device we had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms
   on that hall and flung all the windows to the very top now noses
   protected by handkerchiefs we tremblingly invaded the accursed south
   room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon

   a kind of dark slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall
   door and thence to the desk where a terrible little pool had
   accumulated something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful blind
   hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws
   that traced the hurried last words then the trail led to the couch and
   ended unutterably

   what was or had been on the couch i cannot and dare not say here but
   this is what i shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper
   before i drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what i puzzled out in
   terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that
   hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police
   station the nauseous words seemed wellnigh incredible in that yellow
   sunlight with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending
   clamorously from crowded fourteenth street yet i confess that i
   believed them then whether i believe them now i honestly do not know
   there are things about which it is better not to speculate and all
   that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia and grow faint at a
   draught of unusually cool air

   the end ran that noisome scrawl is here no more icethe man
   looked and ran away warmer every minute and the tissues cant last i
   fancy you knowwhat i said about the will and the nerves and the
   preserved body after the organs ceased to work it was good theory but
   couldnt keep up indefinitely there was a gradual deterioration i had
   not foreseen dr torres knew but the shock killed him he couldnt
   stand what he had to dohe had to get me in a strange dark place when
   he minded my letter and nursed me back and the organs never would work
   again it had to be done my wayartificial preservationfor you see i
   died that time eighteen years ago

   i am writing this under an appreciable mental strain since by tonight
   i shall be no more penniless and at the end of my supply of the drug
   which alone makes life endurable i can bear the torture no longer; and
   shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street
   below do not think from my slavery to morphine that i am a weakling or
   a degenerate when you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may
   guess though never fully realise why it is that i must have
   forgetfulness or death
         it was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the
   broad pacific that the packet of which i was supercargo fell a victim
   to the german searaider the great war was then at its very beginning
   and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later
   degradation; so that our vessel was made legitimate prize whilst we of
   her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as
   naval prisoners so liberal indeed was the discipline of our captors
   that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small
   boat with water and provisions for a good length of time
         when i finally found myself adrift and free i had but little
   idea of my surroundings never a competent navigator i could only
   guess vaguely by the sun and stars that i was somewhat south of the
   equator of the longitude i knew nothing and no island or coastline
   was in sight the weather kept fair and for uncounted days i drifted
   aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for some passing
   ship or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land but neither
   ship nor land appeared and i began to despair in my solitude upon the
   heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue
         the change happened whilst i slept its details i shall never
   know; for my slumber though troubled and dreaminfested was
   continuous when at last i awaked it was to discover myself half
   sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about
   me in monotonous undulations as far as i could see and in which my
   boat lay grounded some distance away
         though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of
   wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery i
   was in reality more horrified than astonished; for there was in the air
   and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very
   core the region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish and of
   other less describable things which i saw protruding from the nasty mud
   of the unending plain perhaps i should not hope to convey in mere
   words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence
   and barren immensity there was nothing within hearing and nothing in
   sight save a vast reach of black slime; yet the very completeness of
   the stillness and homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a
   nauseating fear
         the sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost
   black in its cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh
   beneath my feet as i crawled into the stranded boat i realised that
   only one theory could explain my position through some unprecedented
   volcanic upheaval a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown
   to the surface exposing regions which for innumerable millions of
   years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths so great was
   the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me that i could not
   detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean strain my ears as i
   might nor were there any seafowl to prey upon the dead things
         for several hours i sat thinking or brooding in the boat which
   lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across
   the heavens as the day progressed the ground lost some of its
   stickiness and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling
   purposes in a short time that night i slept but little and the next
   day i made for myself a pack containing food and water preparatory to
   an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescue
         on the third morning i found the soil dry enough to walk upon
   with ease the odour of the fish was maddening; but i was too much
   concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil and set out
   boldly for an unknown goal all day i forged steadily westward guided
   by a faraway hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the
   rolling desert that night i encamped and on the following day still
   travelled toward the hummock though that object seemed scarcely nearer
   than when i had first espied it by the fourth evening i attained the
   base of the mound which turned out to be much higher than it had
   appeared from a distance an intervening valley setting it out in
   sharper relief from the general surface too weary to ascend i slept
   in the shadow of the hill
         i know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the
   waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern
   plain i was awake in a cold perspiration determined to sleep no more
   such visions as i had experienced were too much for me to endure again
   and in the glow of the moon i saw how unwise i had been to travel by
   day without the glare of the parching sun my journey would have cost
   me less energy; indeed i now felt quite able to perform the ascent
   which had deterred me at sunset picking up my pack i started for the
   crest of the eminence
         i have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a
   source of vague horror to me; but i think my horror was greater when i
   gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an
   immeasurable pit or canyon whose black recesses the moon had not yet
   soard high enough to illuminate i felt myself on the edge of the
   world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night
   through my terror ran curious reminiscences of paradise lost and of
   satans hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness
         as the moon climbed higher in the sky i began to see that the
   slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as i had imagined
   ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a
   descent whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet the declivity
   became very gradual urged on by an impulse which i cannot definitely
   analyse i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the
   gentler slope beneath gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had
   yet penetrated
         all at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular
   object on the opposite slope which rose steeply about an hundred yards
   ahead of me; an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays
   of the ascending moon that it was merely a gigantic piece of stone i
   soon assured myself; but i was conscious of a distinct impression that
   its contour and position were not altogether the work of nature a
   closer scrutiny filled me with sensations i cannot express; for despite
   its enormous magnitude and its position in an abyss which had yawned
   at the bottom of the sea since the world was young i perceived beyond
   a doubt that the strange object was a wellshaped monolith whose
   massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of
   living and thinking creatures
         dazed and frightened yet not without a certain thrill of the
   scientists or archaeologists delight i examined my surroundings more
   closely the moon now near the zenith shone weirdly and vividly above
   the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm and revealed the fact
   that a farflung body of water flowed at the bottom winding out of
   sight in both directions and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the
   slope across the chasm the wavelets washed the base of the cyclopean
   monolith; on whose surface i could now trace both inscriptions and
   crude sculptures the writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown
   to me and unlike anything i had ever seen in books; consisting for the
   most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes eels
   octopi crustaceans molluscs whales and the like several characters
   obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern
   world but whose decomposing forms i had observed on the oceanrisen
   plain
         it was the pictorial carving however that did most to hold me
   spellbound plainly visible across the intervening water on account of
   their enormous size were an array of basreliefs whose subjects would
   have excited the envy of doré i think that these things were supposed
   to depict menat least a certain sort of men; though the creatures
   were shewn disporting like fishes in waters of some marine grotto or
   paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the
   waves as well of their faces and forms i dare not speak in detail; for
   the mere remembrance makes me grow faint grotesque beyond the
   imagination of a poe or a bulwer they were damnably human in general
   outline despite webbed hands and feet shockingly wide and flabby lips
   glassy bulging eyes and other features less pleasant to recall
   curiously enough they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of
   proportion with their scenic background; for one of the creatures was
   shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger
   than himself i remarked as i say their grotesqueness and strange
   size but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods
   of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some tribe whose last
   descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the piltdown
   or neanderthal man was born awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into
   a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist i stood
   musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel
   before me
         then suddenly i saw it with only a slight churning to mark its
   rise to the surface the thing slid into view above the dark waters
   vast polyphemuslike and loathsome it darted like a stupendous
   monster of nightmares to the monolith about which it flung its
   gigantic scaly arms the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent
   to certain measured sounds i think i went mad then
         of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff and of my delirious
   journey back to the stranded boat i remember little i believe i sang
   a great deal and laughed oddly when i was unable to sing i have
   indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the
   boat; at any rate i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones
   which nature utters only in her wildest moods
         when i came out of the shadows i was in a san francisco hospital;
   brought thither by the captain of the american ship which had picked up
   my boat in midocean in my delirium i had said much but found that my
   words had been given scant attention of any land upheaval in the
   pacific my rescuers knew nothing; nor did i deem it necessary to
   insist upon a thing which i knew they could not believe once i sought
   out a celebrated ethnologist and amused him with peculiar questions
   regarding the ancient philistine legend of dagon the fishgod; but
   soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional i did not press my
   inquiries
         it is at night especially when the moon is gibbous and waning
   that i see the thing i tried morphine; but the drug has given only
   transient surcease and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless
   slave so now i am to end it all having written a full account for the
   information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellowmen often i ask
   myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasma mere freak of
   fever as i lay sunstricken and raving in the open boat after my escape
   from the german manofwar this i ask myself but ever does there come
   before me a hideously vivid vision in reply i cannot think of the deep
   sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very
   moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed worshipping their
   ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on
   submarine obelisks of watersoaked granite i dream of a day when they
   may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the
   remnants of puny warexhausted mankindof a day when the land shall
   sink and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal
   pandemonium
         the end is near i hear a noise at the door as of some immense
   slippery body lumbering against it it shall not find me god that
   hand! the window! the window!

   oer the midnight moorlands crying
   thro the cypress forests sighing
   in the nightwind madly flying
        hellish forms with streaming hair;
   in the barren branches creaking
   by the stagnant swamppools speaking
   past the shorecliffs ever shrieking
        damnd demons of despair
   once i think i half remember
   ere the grey skies of november
   quenchd my youths aspiring ember
        livd there such a thing as bliss;
   skies that now are dark were beaming
   bold and azure splendid seeming
   till i learnd it all was dreaming 
        deadly drowsiness of dis
   but the stream of time swift flowing
   brings the torment of halfknowing 
   dimly rushing blindly going
        past the nevertrodden lea;
   and the voyager repining
   sees the wicked deathfires shining
   hears the wicked petrels whining
        as he helpless drifts to sea
   evil wings in ether beating;
   vultures at the spirit eating;
   things unseen forever fleeting
        black against the leering sky
   ghastly shades of bygone gladness
   clawing fiends of future sadness
   mingle in a cloud of madness
        ever on the soul to lie
   thus the living lone and sobbing
   in the throes of anguish throbbing
   with the loathsome furies robbing
        night and noon of peace and rest
   but beyond the groans and grating
   of abhorrent life is waiting
   sweet oblivion culminating
        all the years of fruitless quest

   when the last days were upon me and the ugly trifles of existence
   began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that
   torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body i
   loved the irradiate refuge of sleep in my dreams i found a little of
   the beauty i had vainly sought in life and wandered through old
   gardens and enchanted woods

   once when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling and
   sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars

   once when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless
   stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight
   iridescent arbours and undying roses

   and once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves
   and ruins and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines and
   pierced by a little gate of bronze

   many times i walked through that valley and longer and longer would i
   pause in the spectral halflight where the giant trees squirmed and
   twisted grotesquely and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to
   trunk sometimes disclosing the mouldstained stones of buried temples
   and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vinegrown wall with
   the little gate of bronze therein

   after awhile as the days of waking became less and less bearable from
   their greyness and sameness i would often drift in opiate peace
   through the valley and the shadowy groves and wonder how i might seize
   them for my eternal dwellingplace so that i need no more crawl back
   to a dull world stript of interest and new colours and as i looked
   upon the little gate in the mighty wall i felt that beyond it lay a
   dreamcountry from which once it was entered there would be no
   return

   so each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in
   the ivied antique wall though it was exceedingly well hidden and i
   would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting
   merely but more lovely and radiant as well

   then one night in the dreamcity of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus
   filled with the thoughts of dreamsages who dwelt of old in that city
   and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world therein were
   written many things concerning the world of dream and among them was
   lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples and a high
   wall pierced by a little bronze gate when i saw this lore i knew that
   it touched on the scenes i had haunted and i therefore read long in
   the yellowed papyrus

   some of the dreamsages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the
   irrepassable gate but others told of horror and disappointment i knew
   not which to believe yet longed more and more to cross forever into
   the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures and no
   new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the
   commonplace so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate
   and drive me through i resolved to take it when next i awaked

   last night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden
   valley and the shadowy groves; and when i came this time to the antique
   wall i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar from beyond came a
   glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the
   buried temples and i drifted on songfully expectant of the glories of
   the land from whence i should never return

   but as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream
   pushed me through i knew that all sights and glories were at an end;
   for in that new realm was neither land nor sea but only the white void
   of unpeopled and illimitable space so happier than i had ever dared
   hope to be i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal
   oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and
   desolate hour

   fact and fancy  (1917)
   by h p lovecraft
   published february 1917
   9414fact and fancyh p lovecraft1917

   how dull the wretch whose philosophic mind
   disdains the pleasures of fantastic kind;
   whose prosy thoughts the joys of life exclude
   and wreck the solace of the poets mood!
   young zeno practisd in the stoics art
   rejects the language of the glowing heart;
   dissolves sweet nature to a mess of laws;
   condemns th effect whilst looking for the cause;
   freezes poor ovid in an iced review
   and sneers because his fables are untrue!
   in search of hope the hopeful zealot goes
   but all the sadder tums the more he knows!
   stay! vandal sophist whose deep lore would blast
   the grateful legends of the storied past;
   whose tongue in censure flays th embellishd page
   and scorns the comforts of a dreary age:
   wouldst strip the foliage from the vital bough
   till all men grow as wisely dull as thou?
   happy the man whose fresh untainted eye
   discerns a pantheon in the spangled sky;
   finds sylphs and dryads in the waving trees
   and spies soft notus in the southern breeze
   for whom the stream a cheering carol sings
   while reedy music by the fountain rings;
   to whom the waves a nereid tale confide
   till friendly presence fills the rising tide
   happy is he who void of learnings woes
   th ethereal life of bodied nature knows;
   i scorn the sage that tells me it but seems
   and flout his gravity in sunlight dreams!

   8401facts concerning the late arthur jermyn and his familyh p
   lovecraft

i[edit]

   life is a hideous thing and from the background behind what we know of
   it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a
   thousandfold more hideous science already oppressive with its
   shocking revelations will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our
   human speciesif separate species we befor its reserve of unguessed
   horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world
   if we knew what we are we should do as sir arthur jermyn did; and
   arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one
   night no one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial
   to him who had been; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were
   found which made men wish to forget some who knew him do not admit
   that he ever existed

   arthur jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the
   boxed object which had come from africa it was this object and not
   his peculiar personal appearance which made him end his life many
   would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of
   arthur jermyn but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded
   learning was in his blood for his greatgrandfather sir robert
   jermyn bt had been an anthropologist of note whilst his
   greatgreatgreatgrandfather sir wade jermyn was one of the earliest
   explorers of the congo region and had written eruditely of its tribes
   animals and supposed antiquities indeed old sir wade had possessed
   an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania; his bizarre
   conjectures on a prehistoric white congolese civilisation earning him
   much ridicule when his book observation on the several parts of
   africa was published in 1765 this fearless explorer had been placed
   in a madhouse at huntingdon

   madness was in all the jermyns and people were glad there were not
   many of them the line put forth no branches and arthur was the last
   of it if he had not been one can not say what he would have done when
   the object came the jermyns never seemed to look quite
   rightsomething was amiss though arthur was the worst and the old
   family portraits in jermyn house showed fine faces enough before sir
   wades time certainly the madness began with sir wade whose wild
   stories of africa were at once the delight and terror of his few
   friends it showed in his collection of trophies and specimens which
   were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve and
   appeared strikingly in the oriental seclusion in which he kept his
   wife the latter he had said was the daughter of a portuguese trader
   whom he had met in africa; and did not like english ways she with an
   infant son born in africa had accompanied him back from the second and
   longest of his trips and had gone with him on the third and last
   never returning no one had ever seen her closely not even the
   servants; for her disposition had been violent and singular during her
   brief stay at jermyn house she occupied a remote wing and was waited
   on by her husband alone sir wade was indeed most peculiar in his
   solicitude for his family; for when he returned to africa he would
   permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman
   from guinea upon coming back after the death of lady jermyn he
   himself assumed complete care of the boy

   but it was the talk of sir wade especially when in his cups which
   chiefly led his friends to deem him mad in a rational age like the
   eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about
   wild sights and strange scenes under a congo moon; of the gigantic
   walls and pillars of a forgotten city crumbling and vinegrown and of
   damp silent stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness
   of abysmal treasurevaults and inconceivable catacombs especially was
   it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place;
   of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged
   cityfabulous creatures which even a pliny might describe with
   scepticism; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had
   overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars the vaults and
   the weird carvings yet after he came home for the last time sir wade
   would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest mostly
   after his third glass at the knights head; boasting of what he had
   found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known
   only to him and finally he had spoken of the living things in such a
   manner that he was taken to the madhouse he had shown little regret
   when shut into the barred room at huntingdon for his mind moved
   curiously ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy he
   had liked his home less and less till at last he had seemed to dread
   it the knights head had been his headquarters and when he was
   confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection three
   years later he died

   wade jermyns son philip was a highly peculiar person despite a strong
   physical resemblance to his father his appearance and conduct were in
   many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned though he
   did not inherit the madness which was feared by some he was densely
   stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence in frame
   he was small but intensely powerful and was of incredible agility
   twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of
   his gamekeeper a person said to be of gypsy extraction but before his
   son was born joined the navy as a common sailor completing the general
   disgust which his habits and misalliance had begun after the close of
   the american war he was heard of as sailor on a merchantman in the
   african trade having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and
   climbing but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the
   congo coast

   in the son of sir philip jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity
   took a strange and fatal turn tall and fairly handsome with a sort of
   weird eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion
   robert jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator it was he who
   first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his
   mad grandfather had brought from africa and who made the family name
   as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration in 1815 sir robert
   married a daughter of the seventh viscount brightholme and was
   subsequently blessed with three children the eldest and youngest of
   whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and
   body saddened by these family misfortunes the scientist sought relief
   in work and made two long expeditions in the interior of africa in
   1849 his second son nevil a singularly repellent person who seemed to
   combine the surliness of philip jermyn with the hauteur of the
   brightholmes ran away with a vulgar dancer but was pardoned upon his
   return in the following year he came back to jermyn house a widower
   with an infant son alfred who was one day to be the father of arthur
   jermyn

   friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind
   of sir robert jermyn yet it was probably merely a bit of african
   folklore which caused the disaster the elderly scholar had been
   collecting legends of the onga tribes near the field of his
   grandfathers and his own explorations hoping in some way to account
   for sir wades wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid
   creatures a certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor
   suggested that the madmans imagination might have been stimulated by
   native myths on october 19 1852 the explorer samuel seaton called at
   jermyn house with a manuscript of notes collected among the ongas
   believing that certain legends of a gray city of white apes ruled by a
   white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist in his conversation
   he probably supplied many additional details; the nature of which will
   never be known since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into
   being when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind
   the strangled corpse of the explorer and before he could be
   restrained had put an end to all three of his children; the two who
   were never seen and the son who had run away nevil jermyn died in the
   successful defence of his own twoyearold son who had apparently been
   included in the old mans madly murderous scheme sir robert himself
   after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter an
   articulate sound died of apoplexy in the second year of his
   confinement

   sir alfred jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday but his
   tastes never matched his title at twenty he had joined a band of
   musichall performers and at thirtysix had deserted his wife and
   child to travel with an itinerant american circus his end was very
   revolting among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled
   was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a
   surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers
   with this gorilla alfred jermyn was singularly fascinated and on many
   occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the
   intervening bars eventually jermyn asked and obtained permission to
   train the animal astonishing audiences and fellow performers alike
   with his success one morning in chicago as the gorilla and alfred
   jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match the former
   delivered a blow of more than the usual force hurting both the body
   and the dignity of the amateur trainer of what followed members of
   the greatest show on earth do not like to speak they did not expect
   to hear sir alfred jermyn emit a shrill inhuman scream or to see him
   seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands dash it to the floor of
   the cage and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat the gorilla was off
   its guard but not for long and before anything could be done by the
   regular trainer the body which had belonged to a baronet was past
   recognition

ii[edit]

   arthur jermyn was the son of sir alfred jermyn and a musichall singer
   of unknown origin when the husband and father deserted his family the
   mother took the child to jermyn house; where there was none left to
   object to her presence she was not without notions of what a
   noblemans dignity should be and saw to it that her son received the
   best education which limited money could provide the family resources
   were now sadly slender and jermyn house had fallen into woeful
   disrepair but young arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents
   he was not like any other jermyn who had ever lived for he was a poet
   and a dreamer some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of
   old sir wade jermyns unseen portuguese wife declared that her latin
   blood must be showing itself; but most persons merely sneered at his
   sensitiveness to beauty attributing it to his musichall mother who
   was socially unrecognised the poetic delicacy of arthur jermyn was the
   more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance most of the
   jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast but arthurs
   case was very striking it is hard to say just what he resembled but
   his expression his facial angle and the length of his arms gave a
   thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time

   it was the mind and character of arthur jermyn which atoned for his
   aspect gifted and learned he took highest honours at oxford and
   seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family though of
   poetic rather than scientific temperament he planned to continue the
   work of his forefathers in african ethnology and antiquities utilising
   the truly wonderful though strange collection of sir wade with his
   fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which
   the mad explorer had so implicitly believed and would weave tale after
   tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latters wilder
   notes and paragraphs for the nebulous utterances concerning a
   nameless unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling
   of mingled terror and attraction speculating on the possible basis of
   such a fancy and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data
   gleaned by his greatgrandfather and samuel seaton amongst the ongas

   in 1911 after the death of his mother sir arthur jermyn determined to
   pursue his investigations to the utmost extent selling a portion of
   his estate to obtain the requisite money he outfitted an expedition
   and sailed for the congo arranging with the belgian authorities for a
   party of guides he spent a year in the onga and kahn country finding
   data beyond the highest of his expectations among the kaliris was an
   aged chief called mwanu who possessed not only a highly retentive
   memory but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old
   legends this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard
   adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had
   been told to him

   according to mwanu the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no
   more having been annihilated by the warlike nbangus many years ago
   this tribe after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live
   beings had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object
   of their quest; the white apegoddess which the strange beings
   worshipped and which was held by congo tradition to be the form of one
   who had reigned as a princess among these beings just what the white
   apelike creatures could have been mwanu had no idea but he thought
   they were the builders of the ruined city jermyn could form no
   conjecture but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend
   of the stuffed goddess

   the apeprincess it was said became the consort of a great white god
   who had come out of the west for a long time they had reigned over the
   city together but when they had a son all three went away later the
   god and princess had returned and upon the death of the princess her
   divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house
   of stone where it was worshipped then he departed alone the legend
   here seemed to present three variants according to one story nothing
   further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of
   supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it it was for this reason
   that the nbangus carried it off a second story told of a gods return
   and death at the feet of his enshrined wife a third told of the return
   of the son grown to manhoodor apehood or godhood as the case might
   beyet unconscious of his identity surely the imaginative blacks had
   made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant
   legendry

   of the reality of the jungle city described by old sir wade arthur
   jermyn had no further doubt; and was hardly astonished when early in
   1912 he came upon what was left of it its size must have been
   exaggerated yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere
   negro village unfortunately no carvings could be found and the small
   size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one
   visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults
   which sir wade had mentioned the white apes and the stuffed goddess
   were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region but it
   remained for a european to improve on the data offered by old mwanu m
   verhaeren belgian agent at a tradingpost on the congo believed that
   he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess of which he
   had vaguely heard; since the once mighty nbangus were now the
   submissive servants of king alberts government and with but little
   persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had
   carried off when jermyn sailed for england therefore it was with the
   exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a
   priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his
   greatgreatgreatgrandfathers narrativesthat is the wildest which
   he had ever heard countrymen near jermyn house had perhaps heard
   wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to sir wade
   around the tables of the knights head

   arthur jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from m
   verhaeren meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts
   left by his mad ancestor he began to feel closely akin to sir wade
   and to seek relics of the latters personal life in england as well as
   of his african exploits oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded
   wife had been numerous but no tangible relic of her stay at jermyn
   house remained jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or
   permitted such an effacement and decided that the husbands insanity
   was the prime cause his greatgreatgreatgrandmother he recalled
   was said to have been the daughter of a portuguese trader in africa no
   doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the dark
   continent had caused her to flout sir wades tales of the interior a
   thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive she had died in
   africa perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what
   he had told but as jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not
   but smile at their futility a century and a half after the death of
   both his strange progenitors

   in june 1913 a letter arrived from m verhaeren telling of the
   finding of the stuffed goddess it was the belgian averred a most
   extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to
   classify whether it was human or simian only a scientist could
   determine and the process of determination would be greatly hampered
   by its imperfect condition time and the congo climate are not kind to
   mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed
   to be the case here around the creatures neck had been found a golden
   chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt
   some hapless travellers keepsake taken by the nbangus and hung upon
   the goddess as a charm in commenting on the contour of the mummys
   face m verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison; or rather
   expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his corespondent
   but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in
   levity the stuffed goddess he wrote would arrive duly packed about a
   month after receipt of the letter

   the boxed object was delivered at jermyn house on the afternoon of
   august 3 1913 being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which
   housed the collection of african specimens as arranged by sir robert
   and arthur what ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants
   and from things and papers later examined of the various tales that
   of aged soames the family butler is most ample and coherent
   according to this trustworthy man sir arthur jermyn dismissed everyone
   from the room before opening the box though the instant sound of
   hammer and chisel showed that he did not delay the operation nothing
   was heard for some time; just how long soames cannot exactly estimate
   but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the
   horrible scream undoubtedly in jermyns voice was heard immediately
   afterward jermyn emerged from the room rushing frantically toward the
   front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy the expression
   on his face a face ghastly enough in repose was beyond description
   when near the front door he seemed to think of something and turned
   back in his flight finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar
   the servants were utterly dumbfounded and watched at the head of the
   stairs but their master did not return a smell of oil was all that
   came up from the regions below after dark a rattling was heard at the
   door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a stableboy saw
   arthur jermyn glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of
   that fluid steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor
   surrounding the house then in an exaltation of supreme horror
   everyone saw the end a spark appeared on the moor a flame arose and
   a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens the house of jermyn no
   longer existed

   the reason why arthur jermyns charred fragments were not collected and
   buried lies in what was found afterward principally the thing in the
   box the stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight withered and eaten away
   but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species less
   hairy than any recorded variety and infinitely nearer mankindquite
   shockingly so detailed description would be rather unpleasant but two
   salient particulars must be told for they fit in revoltingly with
   certain notes of sir wade jermyns african expeditions and with the
   congolese legends of the white god and the apeprincess the two
   particulars in question are these: the arms on the golden locket about
   the creatures neck were the jermyn arms and the jocose suggestion of
   m verhaeren about certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled
   face applied with vivid ghastly and unnatural horror to none other
   than the sensitive arthur jermyn greatgreatgreatgrandson of sir
   wade jermyn and an unknown wife members of the royal anthropological
   institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well and some
   of them do not admit that arthur jermyn ever existed

   festival
   by h p lovecraft
   published december 1926 in weird tales
   12047festivalh p lovecraft

   there is snow on the ground
     and the valleys are cold
   and a midnight profound
    blackly squats oer the wold;
   but a light on the hilltops halfseen hints of
     feastings unhallowed and old

   there is death in the clouds
     there is fear in the night
   for the dead in their shrouds
     hail the suns turning flight
   and chant wild in the woods as they dance
     round a yulealtar fungous and white

   to no gale of earths kind
     sways the forest of oak
   where the thick boughs entwined
     by mad mistletoes choke
   for these powrs are the powrs of the dark
     from the graves of the lost druidfolk

   and mayst thou to such deeds
     be an abbot and priest
   singing cannibal greeds
     at each devilwrought feast
   and to all the incredulous world
     shewing dimly the sign of the beast

   four oclock  (1922)
   by sonia h greene
   1345510four oclocksonia h greene1922

   about two in the morning i knew it was coming the great black silences
   of nights depth told me and a monstrous cricket chirping with a
   persistence too hideous to be unmeaning made it certain it is to be
   at four oclock  at four in the dusk before dawn just as he said it
   would be i had not fully believed it previously because the
   prophecies of vindictive madmen are seldom to be taken with
   seriousness besides i was not justly to be blamed for what had
   befallen him at four oclock on that other morning; that terrible
   morning whose memory will never leave me and when at length he had
   died and was buried in the ancient cemetery just across the road from
   my east windows i was certain that his curse could not harm me had i
   not seen his lifeless clay securely pinned down by huge shovelfuls of
   mould? might i not feel assured that his crumbling bones would be
   powerless to bring me the doom at a day and an hour so precisely
   stated? such indeed had been my thoughts until this shocking night
   itself; this night of incredible chaos of shattered certainties and
   of nameless portents

   i had retired early hoping fatuously to snatch a few hours of sleep
   despite the prophecy which haunted me now that the time was so close
   at hand i found it harder and harder to dismiss the vague fears which
   had always lain beneath my conscious thoughts as the cooling sheets
   soothed my fevered body i could find nothing to soothe my still more
   fevered mind; but lay tossing and uneasily awake trying first one
   position and then another in a desperate effort to banish with slumber
   that one damnably insistent notion  that it is to occur at four
   oclock

   was this frightful unrest due to my surroundings; to the fateful
   locality in which i was sojourning after so many years? why i now
   asked myself bitterly had i permitted circumstance to place me on this
   night of all nights in that wellremembered house and that
   wellremembered room whose east windows overlook the lonely road and
   the ancient country cemetery beyond? in my minds eye every detail of
   that unpretentious necropolis rose before me  its white fence its
   ghostlike granite shafts and the hovering auras of those on whom the
   worms fed finally the force of the conception led my vision to depths
   more remote and more forbidden and i saw under the neglected grass the
   silent shapes of the things from which the auras came  the calm
   sleepers the rotting things the things which had twisted frantically
   in their coffins before sleep came and the peaceful bones in every
   stage of disintegration from the complete and coherent skeleton to the
   huddled handful of dust most of all i envied the dust then new terror
   came as my fancy encountered his grave into that sepulcher i dared not
   let my thought stray and i should have screamed had not something
   forestalled the malign power that pulled my mental sight that
   something was a sudden gust of wind sprung from nowhere amidst the
   calm night which unfastened the shutter of the nearest window
   throwing it back with a shivery slam and uncovering to my actual waking
   glance the antique cemetery itself brooding spectrally beneath an
   early morning moon

   i speak of this gust as something merciful yet know now that it was
   only transiently and mockingly so for no sooner had my eyes compassed
   the moonlight scene than i became aware of a fresh omen this time too
   unmistakable to be classed as an empty phantasm which arose from among
   the gleaming tombs across the road having glanced with instinctive
   apprehension toward the spot where he lay mouldering  a spot cut off
   from my gaze by the windowframe  i perceived with trepidation the
   approach of an indescribable something which flowed menacingly from
   that very direction ; a vague vaporous formless mass of greyish
   white substance or spirit dull and tenuous as yet but every moment
   increasing in awesome and cataclysmic potentiality try as i might to
   dismiss it as a natural meteorological phenomenon its fearsomely
   portentous and deliberate character grew upon me amidst new thrills of
   horror and apprehension; so that i was scarcely unprepared for the
   definitely purposeful and malevolent culmination which soon occurred
   that culmination bringing with it a hideous symbolic foreshadowing of
   the end was equally simple and threatening the vapor each moment
   thickened and piled up assuming at last a half tangible aspect; while
   the surface toward me gradually became circular in outline and
   markedly concave; as it slowly ceased its advance and stood spectrally
   at the end of the road and as it stood there faintly quivering in the
   damp night air under that unwholesome moon i saw that its aspect was
   that of the pallid and gigantic dial of a distorted clock

   hideous events now followed in demoniac succession there took shape in
   the lower righthand part of the vaporous dial a black and formidable
   creature shapeless and only half seen yet having four prominent claws
   which reached out greedily at me  claws redolent of noxious fatality
   in their very contour and location; since they formed too plainly the
   dreaded outlines and filled too unmistakably the exact position of
   the numeral iv on the quivering dial of doom presently the monstrosity
   stepped or wriggled out of the concave surface of the dial and began
   to approach me by some unexplained kind of locomotion the four talons
   long thin and straight were now seen to be tipped by disgusting
   threadlike tentacles each with a vile intelligence of its own which
   groped about incessantly slowly at first but gradually increasing in
   velocity until i was nearly driven mad by the sheer dizziness of their
   motion and as a crowning horror i began to hear all the subtle and
   cryptical noises that pierced the intensified night silence; a
   thousandfold magnified and in one voice reminding me of the abhorred
   hour of four in vain i tried to pull up the coverlet to shut them out;
   in vain i tried to drown them with my screams i was mute and
   paralyzed yet agonizingly aware of every unnatural sight and sound in
   that devastating mooncursed stillness once i managed to get my head
   beneath the covers  once when the crickets shrieking of that hideous
   phrase fouroclock seemed about to shatter my brain  but that only
   aggravated the terror making the roars of that detestable creature
   strike me like the blows of a titanic sledgehammer

   and now as i withdrew my tortured head from its fruitless protection
   i found augmented diabolism to harass my eyes upon the newly painted
   wall of my apartment as if called forth by the tentacled monster from
   the tomb there danced mockingly before me a myriad company of beings
   black grey and white such as only the fancy of the godstricken
   might visualize some were of infinitesimal smallness; others covered
   vast areas in minor details each had a grotesque and horrible
   individuality in general outlines they all conformed to the same
   nightmare pattern despite their vastly varied size again i tried to
   shut out the abnormalities of the night but vainly as before the
   dancing things on the wall waxed and waned in magnitude approaching
   and receding as they trod their morbid and menacing measure and the
   aspect of each was that of some demon clockface with one sinister hour
   always figured thereon  the dreaded the doomdelivering hour of four

   baffled in every attempt to shake off the circling and relentless
   delirium i glanced once more toward the unshuttered window and beheld
   again the monster which had come from the grave horrible it had been
   before; indescribable it had now become the creature formerly of
   indeterminate substance was now formed of red and malignant fire; and
   waved repulsively its four tentacled claws  unspeakable tongues of
   living flame it stared and stared at me out of the blackness;
   sneeringly mockingly; now advancing now retiring then in the
   tenebrous silence those four writhing talons of fire beckoned
   invitingly to their demoniacally dancing counterparts on the walls and
   seemed to beat time rhythmically to the shocking saraband till the
   world was one ghoulishly gyrating vortex of leaping prancing gliding
   leering taunting threatening four oclocks

   somewhere beginning afar off and advancing slowly over the sphinx like
   sea and the febrile marshes i heard the early morning wind come
   soughing; faintly at first then louder and louder until its unceasing
   burden flowed as a deluge of whirring buzzing cacophony bringing
   always the hideous threat `four oclock four oclock four oclock
   monotonously it grew from a whimper to a deafening roar as of a giant
   cataract but finally reached a climax and began to subside as it
   receded into the distance it left upon my sensitive ears such a
   vibration as is left by the passing of a swift and ponderous railway
   train; this and a stark dread whose intensity gave it something of the
   tranquility of resignation

   the end is near all sound and vision have become one vast chaotic
   maelstrom of lethal clamorous menace wherein are fused all the
   ghastly and unhallowed four oclocks which have existed since
   immemorial time began and all which will exist in eternities to come
   the flaming monster is advancing closely now its charnel tentacles
   brushing my face and its talons curving hungrily as they grope toward
   my throat at last i can see its face through the churning and
   phosphorescent vapors of the graveyard air and with devastating pangs
   i realize that it is in essence an awful colossal gargoylelike
   caricature of his face  the face of him from whose uneasy grave it
   has issued now i know that my doom is indeed sealed; that the wild
   threats of the madman were in truth the demon maledictions of a potent
   fiend and that my innocence will prove no protection against the
   malign volition which craves a causeless vengeance he is determined to
   pay me with interest for what he suffered at that spectral hour;
   determined to drag me out of the world into realms which only the mad
   and the devilridden know

   and as amidst the seething of hells flames and the tumult of the
   damned those fiery claws point murderously at my throat i hear upon
   the mantel the faint whirring sound of a timepiece; the whirring which
   tells me that it is about to strike the hour whose name now flows
   incessantly from the deathlike and cavernous throat of the rattling
   jeering croaking gravemonster before me  the accursed the infernal
   hour of four oclock

   horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my
   best friend crawford tillinghast i had not seen him since that day
   two months and a half before when he told me toward what goal his
   physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered
   my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his
   laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage i had known that
   he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed
   electrical machine eating little and excluding even the servants but
   i had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and
   disfigure any human creature it is not pleasant to see a stout man
   suddenly grown thin and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes
   yellowed or grayed the eyes sunken circled and uncannily glowing
   the forehead veined and corrugated and the hands tremulous and
   twitching and if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness a
   wild disorder of dress a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots
   and an unchecked growth of white beard on a face once cleanshaven the
   cumulative effect is quite shocking but such was the aspect of
   crawford tilllinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me
   to his door after my weeks of exile; such was the specter that trembled
   as it admitted me candle in hand and glanced furtively over its
   shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient lonely house
   set back from benevolent street

   that crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and
   philosophy was a mistake these things should be left to the frigid and
   impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives
   to the man of feeling and action; despair if he fail in his quest and
   terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed tillinghast had
   once been the prey of failure solitary and melancholy; but now i knew
   with nauseating fears of my own that he was the prey of success i had
   indeed warned him ten weeks before when he burst forth with his tale
   of what he felt himself about to discover he had been flushed and
   excited then talking in a high and unnatural though always pedantic
   voice

   what do we know he had said of the world and the universe about
   us? our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few and our
   notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow we see things only as
   we are constructed to see them and can gain no idea of their absolute
   nature with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the
   boundlessly complex cosmos yet other beings with wider stronger or
   different range of senses might not only see very differently the
   things we see but might see and study whole worlds of matter energy
   and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the
   senses we have i have always believed that such strange inaccessible
   worlds exist at our very elbows and now i believe i have found a way
   to break down the barriers i am not joking within twentyfour hours
   that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized
   sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges
   those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several
   unknown to anything we consider organic life we shall see that at
   which dogs howl in the dark and that at which cats prick up their ears
   after midnight we shall see these things and other things which no
   breathing creature has yet seen we shall overleap time space and
   dimensions and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation

   when tillinghast said these things i remonstrated for i knew him well
   enough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic and
   drove me from the house now he was no less a fanatic but his desire
   to speak had conquered his resentment and he had written me
   imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognize as i entered the
   abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle
   i became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the
   shadows the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied
   forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light and i
   sickened at the hollow altered voice of my host i wished the servants
   were about and did not like it when he said they had all left three
   days previously it seemed strange that old gregory at least should
   desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i it was he who
   had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was
   repulsed in rage

   yet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and
   fascination just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could
   only guess but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to
   impart i could not doubt before i had protested at his unnatural
   pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to
   some degree i almost shared his spirit terrible though the cost of
   victory appeared up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed
   the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody of man the
   electricity seemed to be turned off and when i asked my guide he said
   it was for a definite reason

   it would be too much i would not dare he continued to mutter i
   especially noted his new habit of muttering for it was not like him to
   talk to himself we entered the laboratory in the attic and i observed
   that detestable electrical machine glowing with a sickly sinister
   violet luminosity it was connected with a powerful chemical battery
   but seemed to be receiving no current; for i recalled that in its
   experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action in reply
   to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not
   electrical in any sense that i could understand

   he now seated me near the machine so that it was on my right and
   turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs
   the usual sputtering began turned to a whine and terminated in a
   drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence meanwhile the
   luminosity increased waned again then assumed a pale outrè colour or
   blend of colours which i could neither place nor describe tillinghast
   had been watching me and noted my puzzled expression

   do you know what that is? he whispered that is ultraviolet he
   chuckled oddly at my surprise you thought ultraviolet was invisible
   and so it is  but you can see that and many other invisible things
   now

   listen to me! the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping
   senses in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the
   state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity i have
   seen the truth and i intend to show it to you do you wonder how it
   will seem? i will tell you here tillinghast seated himself directly
   opposite me blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes
   your existing senseorgans  ears first i think  will pick up many
   of the impressions for they are closely connected with the dormant
   organs then there will be others you have heard of the pineal gland?
   i laugh at the shallow endocrinologist fellowdupe and fellowparvenu
   of the freudian that gland is the great sense organ of organs  i have
   found out it is like sight in the end and transmits visual pictures
   to the brain if you are normal that is the way you ought to get most
   of it i mean get most of the evidence from beyond

   i looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall
   dimly lit by rays which the every day eye cannot see the far corners
   were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which
   obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and
   phantasm during the interval that tillinghast was long silent i
   fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of longdead gods; some
   vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a
   floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision
   the picture was very vivid for a while but gradually gave way to a
   more horrible conception; that of utter absolute solitude in infinite
   sightless soundless space there seemed to be a void and nothing
   more and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip
   pocket the revolver i carried after dark since the night i was held up
   in east providence then from the farthermost regions of remoteness
   the sound softly glided into existence it was infinitely faint subtly
   vibrant and unmistakably musical but held a quality of surpassing
   wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole
   body i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally
   scratching ground glass simultaneously there developed something like
   a cold draught which apparently swept past me from the direction of
   the distant sound as i waited breathlessly i perceived that both sound
   and wind were increasing; the effect being to give me an odd notion of
   myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching
   locomotive i began to speak to tillinghast and as i did so all the
   unusual impressions abruptly vanished i saw only the man the glowing
   machines and the dim apartment tillinghast was grinning repulsively
   at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn but from his
   expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i if not a
   great deal more i whispered what i had experienced and he bade me to
   remain as quiet and receptive as possible

   dont move he cautioned for in these rays we are able to be seen
   as well as to see i told you the servants left but i didnt tell you
   how it was that thickwitted housekeeper  she turned on the lights
   downstairs after i had warned her not to and the wires picked up
   sympathetic vibrations it must have been frightful  i could hear the
   screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hearing from another
   direction and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of
   clothes around the house mrs updikes clothes were close to the front
   hall switch  thats how i know she did it it got them all but so
   long as we dont move were fairly safe remember were dealing with a
   hideous world in which we are practically helpless keep still!

   the combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me
   a kind of paralysis and in my terror my mind again opened to the
   impressions coming from what tillinghast called beyond i was now in
   a vortex of sound and motion with confused pictures before my eyes i
   saw the blurred outlines of the room but from some point in space
   there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes
   or clouds penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right
   of me then i glimpsed the temple  like effect again but this time
   the pillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light which sent down
   one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen
   before after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic and in
   the jumble of sights sounds and unidentified senseimpressions i felt
   that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form one
   definite flash i shall always remember i seemed for an instant to
   behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining revolving
   spheres and as it receded i saw that the glowing suns formed a
   constellation or galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the
   distorted face of crawford tillinghast at another time i felt the huge
   animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting
   through my supposedly solid body and thought i saw tillinghast look at
   them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually i
   recalled what he had said of the pineal gland and wondered what he saw
   with this preternatural eye

   suddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight over
   and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which though
   vague held the elements of consistency and permanence it was indeed
   somewhat familiar for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual
   terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted
   curtain of a theater i saw the attic laboratory the electrical
   machine and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me; but of all
   the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant
   indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting
   disarray and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien
   unknown entities it likewise seemed that all the known things entered
   into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa foremost
   among the living objects were inky jellyfish monstrosities which
   flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine they
   were present in loathsome profusion and i saw to my horror that they
   overlapped; that they were semifluid and capable of passing through
   one another and through what we know as solids these things were never
   still but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose
   sometimes they appeared to devour one another the attacker launching
   itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from
   sight shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the
   unfortunate servants and could not exclude the thing from my mind as i
   strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies
   unseen around us but tillinghast had been watching me and was
   speaking

   you see them? you see them? you see the things that float and flop
   about you and through you every moment of your life? you see the
   creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky? have i
   not succeeded in breaking down the barrier; have i not shown you worlds
   that no other living men have seen? i heard his scream through the
   horrible chaos and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close
   to mine his eyes were pits of flame and they glared at me with what i
   now saw was overwhelming hatred the machine droned detestably

   you think those floundering things wiped out the servants? fool they
   are harmless! but the servants are gone arent they? you tried to stop
   me; you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i
   could get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth you damned coward but
   now ive got you! what swept up the servants? what made them scream so
   loud? dont know eh! youll know soon enough look at me  listen
   to what i say  do you suppose there are really any such things as time
   and magnitude? do you fancy there are such things as form or matter? i
   tell you i have struck depths that your little brain cant picture i
   have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from the
   stars i have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world
   to sow death and madness space belongs to me do you hear? things
   are hunting me now  the things that devour and dissolve  but i know
   how to elude them it is you they will get as they got the servants
   stirring dear sir? i told you it was dangerous to move i have saved
   you so far by telling you to keep still  saved you to see more sights
   and to listen to me if you had moved they would have been at you long
   ago dont worry they wont hurt you they didnt hurt the servants 
   it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so my pets are not
   pretty for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are 
   very different disintegration is quite painless i assure you  but i
   want you to see them i almost saw them but i knew how to stop you
   are curious? i always knew you were no scientist trembling eh
   trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things i have discovered
   why dont you move then? tired? well dont worry my friend for they
   are coming look look curse you look its just over your left
   shoulder

   what remains to be told is very brief and may be familiar to you from
   the newspaper accounts the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast
   house and found us there  tillinghast dead and me unconscious they
   arrested me because the revolver was in my hand but released me in
   three hours after they found it was apoplexy which had finished
   tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious
   machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor i
   did not tell very much of what i had seen for i feared the coroner
   would be skeptical; but from the evasive outline i did give the doctor
   told me that i had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and
   homicidal madman

   i wish i could believe that doctor it would help my shaky nerves if i
   could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and
   above me i never feel alone or comfortable and a hideous sense of
   pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary what prevents
   me from believing the doctor is one simple fact  that the police never
   found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast
   murdered

i the book[edit]

   the place was dark and dusty and halflost
   in tangles of old alleys near the quays
   reeking of strange things brought in from the seas
   and with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed
   small lozenge panes obscured by smoke and frost
   just shewed the books in piles like twisted trees
   rotting from floor to roof  congeries
   of crumbling elder lore at little cost

   i entered charmed and from a cobwebbed heap
   took up the nearest tome and thumbed it through
   trembling at curious words that seemed to keep
   some secret monstrous if one only knew
   then looking for some seller old in craft
   i could find nothing but a voice that laughed

ii pursuit[edit]

   i held the book beneath my coat at pains
   to hide the thing from sight in such a place;
   hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes
   with oftenturning head and nervous pace
   dull furtive windows in old tottering brick
   peered at me oddly as i hastened by
   and thinking what they sheltered i grew sick
   for a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky

   no one had seen me take the thing  but still
   a blank laugh echoed in my whirling head
   and i could guess what nighted worlds of ill
   lurked in that volume i had coveted
   the way grew strange  the walls alike and madding 
   and far behind me unseen feet were padding

iii the key[edit]

   i do not know what windings in the waste
   of those strange sealanes brought me home once more
   but on my porch i trembled white with haste
   to get inside and bolt the heavy door
   i had the book that told the hidden way
   across the void and through the spacehung screens
   that hold the undimensioned worlds at bay
   and keep lost aeons to their own demesnes

   at last the key was mine to those vague visions
   of sunset spires and twilight woods that brood
   dim in the gulfs beyond this earths precisions
   lurking as memories of infinitude
   the key was mine but as i sat there mumbling
   the attic window shook with a faint fumbling

iv recognition[edit]

   the day had come again when as a child
   i saw  just once  that hollow of old oaks
   grey with a groundmist that enfolds and chokes
   the slinking shapes which madness has defiled
   it was the same  an herbage rank and wild
   clings round an altar whose carved sign invokes
   that nameless one to whom a thousand smokes
   rose aeons gone from unclean towers uppiled

   i saw the body spread on that dank stone
   and knew those things which feasted were not men;
   i knew this strange grey world was not my own
   but yuggoth past the starry voids  and then
   the body shrieked at me with a dead cry
   and all too late i knew that it was i!

v homecoming[edit]

   the daemon said that he would take me home
   to the pale shadowy land i half recalled
   as a high place of stair and terrace walled
   with marble balustrades that skywinds comb
   while miles below a maze of dome on dome
   and tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled
   once more he told me i would stand enthralled
   on those old heights and hear the faroff foam

   all this he promised and through sunsets gate
   he swept me past the lapping lakes of flame
   and redgold thrones of gods without a name
   who shriek in fear at some impending fate
   then a black gulf with seasounds in the night:
   here was your home he mocked when you had sight!

vi the lamp[edit]

   we found the lamp inside those hollow cliffs
   whose chiseled sign no priest in thebes could read
   and from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphs
   warned every living creature of earths breed
   no more was there  just that one brazen bowl
   with traces of a curious oil within;
   fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll
   and symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin

   little the fears of forty centuries meant
   to us as we bore off our slender spoil
   and when we scanned it in our darkened tent
   we struck a match to test the ancient oil
   it blazed  great god! but the vast shapes we saw
   in that mad flash have seared our lives with awe

vii zamans hill[edit]

   the great hill hung close over the old town
   a precipice against the main streets end;
   green tall and wooded looking darkly down
   upon the steeple at the highway bend
   two hundred years the whispers had been heard
   about what happened on the manshunned slope 
   tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird
   or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope

   one day the mailman found no village there
   nor were its folk or houses seen again;
   people came out from aylesbury to stare 
   yet they all told the mailman it was plain
   that he was mad for saying he had spied
   the great hills gluttonous eyes and jaws stretched wide

viii the port[edit]

   ten miles from arkham i had struck the trail
   that rides the cliffedge over boynton beach
   and hoped that just at sunset i could reach
   the crest that looks on innsmouth in the vale
   far out at sea was a retreating sail
   white as hard years of ancient winds could bleach
   but evil with some portent beyond speech
   so that i did not wave my hand or hail

   sails out of innsmouth! echoing old renown
   of longdead times but now a tooswift night
   is closing in and i have reached the height
   whence i so often scan the distant town
   the spires and roofs are there  but look! the gloom
   sinks on dark lanes as lightless as the tomb!

ix the courtyard[edit]

   it was the city i had known before;
   the ancient leprous town where mongrel throngs
   chant to strange gods and beat unhallowed gongs
   in crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore
   the rotting fisheyed houses leered at me
   from where they leaned drunk and halfanimate
   as edging through the filth i passed the gate
   to the black courtyard where the man would be

   the dark walls closed me in and loud i cursed
   that ever i had come to such a den
   when suddenly a score of windows burst
   into wild light and swarmed with dancing men:
   mad soundless revels of the dragging dead 
   and not a corpse had either hands or head!

x the pigeonflyers[edit]

   they took me slumming where gaunt walls of brick
   bulge outward with a viscous storedup evil
   and twisted faces thronging foul and thick
   wink messages to alien god and devil
   a million fires were blazing in the streets
   and from flat roofs a furtive few would fly
   bedraggled birds into the yawning sky
   while hidden drums droned on with measured beats

   i knew those fires were brewing monstrous things
   and that those birds of space had been outside 
   i guessed to what dark planets crypts they plied
   and what they brought from thog beneath their wings
   the others laughed  till struck too mute to speak
   by what they glimpsed in one birds evil beak

xi the well[edit]

   farmer seth atwood was past eighty when
   he tried to sink that deep well by his door
   with only eb to help him bore and bore
   we laughed and hoped hed soon be sane again
   and yet instead young eb went crazy too
   so that they shipped him to the county farm
   seth bricked the wellmouth up as tight as glue 
   then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm

   after the funeral we felt bound to get
   out to that well and rip the bricks away
   but all we saw were iron handholds set
   down a black hole deeper than we could say
   and yet we put the bricks back  for we found
   the hole too deep for any line to sound

xii the howler[edit]

   they told me not to take the briggs hill path
   that used to be the highroad through to zoar
   for goody watkins hanged in seventeenfour
   had left a certain monstrous aftermath
   yet when i disobeyed and had in view
   the vinehung cottage by the great rock slope
   i could not think of elms or hempen rope
   but wondered why the house still seemed so new

   stopping a while to watch the fading day
   i heard faint howls as from a room upstairs
   when through the ivied panes one sunset ray
   struck in and caught the howler unawares
   i glimpsed  and ran in frenzy from the place
   and from a fourpawed thing with human face

xiii hesperia[edit]

   the winter sunset flaming beyond spires
   and chimneys halfdetached from this dull sphere
   opens great gates to some forgotten year
   of elder splendours and divine desires
   expectant wonders burn in those rich fires
   adventurefraught and not untinged with fear;
   a row of sphinxes where the way leads clear
   toward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres

   it is the land where beautys meaning flowers;
   where every unplaced memory has a source;
   where the great river time begins its course
   down the vast void in starlit streams of hours
   dreams bring us close  but ancient lore repeats
   that human tread has never soiled these streets

xiv starwinds[edit]

   it is a certain hour of twilight glooms
   mostly in autumn when the starwind pours
   down hilltop streets deserted outofdoors
   but shewing early lamplight from snug rooms
   the dead leaves rush in strange fantastic twists
   and chimneysmoke whirls round with alien grace
   heeding geometries of outer space
   while fomalhaut peers in through southward mists

   this is the hour when moonstruck poets know
   what fungi sprout in yuggoth and what scents
   and tints of flowers fill nithons continents
   such as in no poor earthly garden blow
   yet for each dream these winds to us convey
   a dozen more of ours they sweep away!

xv antarktos[edit]

   deep in my dream the great bird whispered queerly
   of the black cone amid the polar waste;
   pushing above the icesheet lone and drearly
   by stormcrazed aeons battered and defaced
   hither no living earthshapes take their courses
   and only pale auroras and faint suns
   glow on that pitted rock whose primal sources
   are guessed at dimly by the elder ones

   if men should glimpse it they would merely wonder
   what tricky mound of natures build they spied;
   but the bird told of vaster parts that under
   the miledeep iceshroud crouch and brood and bide
   god help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
   those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below!

xvi the window[edit]

   the house was old with tangled wings outthrown
   of which no one could ever half keep track
   and in a small room somewhat near the back
   was an odd window sealed with ancient stone
   there in a dreamplagued childhood quite alone
   i used to go where night reigned vague and black;
   parting the cobwebs with a curious lack
   of fear and with a wonder each time grown

   one later day i brought the masons there
   to find what view my dim forbears had shunned
   but as they pierced the stone a rush of air
   burst from the alien voids that yawned beyond
   they fled  but i peered through and found unrolled
   all the wild worlds of which my dreams had told

xvii a memory[edit]

   there were great steppes and rocky tablelands
   stretching halflimitless in starlit night
   with alien campfires shedding feeble light
   on beasts with tinkling bells in shaggy bands
   far to the south the plain sloped low and wide
   to a dark zigzag line of wall that lay
   like a huge python of some primal day
   which endless time had chilled and petrified

   i shivered oddly in the cold thin air
   and wondered where i was and how i came
   when a cloaked form against a campfires glare
   rose and approached and called me by my name
   staring at that dead face beneath the hood
   i ceased to hope  because i understood

xviii the gardens of yin[edit]

   beyond that wall whose ancient masonry
   reached almost to the sky in mossthick towers
   there would be terraced gardens rich with flowers
   and flutter of bird and butterfly and bee
   there would be walks and bridges arching over
   warm lotospools reflecting temple eaves
   and cherrytrees with delicate boughs and leaves
   against a pink sky where the herons hover

   all would be there for had not old dreams flung
   open the gate to that stonelanterned maze
   where drowsy streams spin out their winding ways
   trailed by green vines from bending branches hung?
   i hurried  but when the wall rose grim and great
   i found there was no longer any gate

xix the bells[edit]

   year after year i heard that faint far ringing
   of deeptoned bells on the black midnight wind;
   peals from no steeple i could ever find
   but strange as if across some great void winging
   i searched my dreams and memories for a clue
   and thought of all the chimes my visions carried;
   of quiet innsmouth where the white gulls tarried
   around an ancient spire that once i knew

   always perplexed i heard those far notes falling
   till one march night the bleak rain splashing cold
   beckoned me back through gateways of recalling
   to elder towers where the mad clappers tolled
   they tolled  but from the sunless tides that pour
   through sunken valleys on the seas dead floor

xx nightgaunts[edit]

   out of what crypt they crawl i cannot tell
   but every night i see the rubbery things
   black horned and slender with membraneous wings
   and tails that bear the bifid barb of hell
   they come in legions on the north winds swell
   with obscene clutch that titillates and stings
   snatching me off on monstrous voyagings
   to grey worlds hidden deep in nightmares well

   over the jagged peaks of thok they sweep
   heedless of all the cries i try to make
   and down the nether pits to that foul lake
   where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep
   but oh! if only they would make some sound
   or wear a face where faces should be found!

xxi nyarlathotep[edit]

   and at the last from inner egypt came
   the strange dark one to whom the fellahs bowed;
   silent and lean and cryptically proud
   and wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame
   throngs pressed around frantic for his commands
   but leaving could not tell what they had heard;
   while through the nations spread the awestruck word
   that wild beasts followed him and licked his hands

   soon from the sea a noxious birth began;
   forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;
   the ground was cleft and mad auroras rolled
   down on the quaking citadels of man
   then crushing what he chanced to mould in play
   the idiot chaos blew earths dust away

xxii azathoth[edit]

   out in the mindless void the daemon bore me
   past the bright clusters of dimensioned space
   till neither time nor matter stretched before me
   but only chaos without form or place
   here the vast lord of all in darkness muttered
   things he had dreamed but could not understand
   while near him shapeless batthings flopped and fluttered
   in idiot vortices that raystreams fanned

   they danced insanely to the high thin whining
   of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw
   whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining
   gives each frail cosmos its eternal law
   i am his messenger the daemon said
   as in contempt he struck his masters head

xxiii mirage[edit]

   i do not know if ever it existed 
   that lost world floating dimly on times stream 
   and yet i see it often violetmisted
   and shimmering at the back of some vague dream
   there were strange towers and curious lapping rivers
   labyrinths of wonder and low vaults of light
   and boughcrossed skies of flame like that which quivers
   wistfully just before a winters night

   great moors led off to sedgy shores unpeopled
   where vast birds wheeled while on a windswept hill
   there was a village ancient and whitesteepled
   with evening chimes for which i listen still
   i do not know what land it is  or dare
   ask when or why i was or will be there

xxiv the canal[edit]

   somewhere in dream there is an evil place
   where tall deserted buildings crowd along
   a deep black narrow channel reeking strong
   of frightful things whence oily currents race
   lanes with old walls half meeting overhead
   wind off to streets one may or may not know
   and feeble moonlight sheds a spectral glow
   over long rows of windows dark and dead

   there are no footfalls and the one soft sound
   is of the oily water as it glides
   under stone bridges and along the sides
   of its deep flume to some vague ocean bound
   none lives to tell when that stream washed away
   its dreamlost region from the world of clay

xxv st toads[edit]

   beware st toads cracked chimes! i heard him scream
   as i plunged into those mad lanes that wind
   in labyrinths obscure and undefined
   south of the river where old centuries dream
   he was a furtive figure bent and ragged
   and in a flash had staggered out of sight
   so still i burrowed onward in the night
   toward where more rooflines rose malign and jagged

   no guidebook told of what was lurking here 
   but now i heard another old man shriek:
   beware sttoads cracked chimes! and growing weak
   i paused when a third greybeard croaked in fear:
   beware st toads cracked chimes! aghast i fled 
   till suddenly that black spire loomed ahead

xxvi the familiars[edit]

   john whateley lived about a mile from town
   up where the hills begin to huddle thick;
   we never thought his wits were very quick
   seeing the way he let his farm run down
   he used to waste his time on some queer books
   hed found around the attic of his place
   till funny lines got creased into his face
   and folks all said they didnt like his looks

   when he began those nighthowls we declared
   hed better be locked up away from harm
   so three men from the aylesbury town farm
   went for him  but came back alone and scared
   theyd found him talking to two crouching things
   that at their step flew off on great black wings

xxvii the elder pharos[edit]

   from leng where rocky peaks climb bleak and bare
   under cold stars obscure to human sight
   there shoots at dusk a single beam of light
   whose far blue rays make shepherds whine in prayer
   they say (though none has been there) that it comes
   out of a pharos in a tower of stone
   where the last elder one lives on alone
   talking to chaos with the beat of drums

   the thing they whisper wears a silken mask
   of yellow whose queer folds appear to hide
   a face not of this earth though none dares ask
   just what those features are which bulge inside
   many in mans first youth sought out that glow
   but what they found no one will ever know

xxviii expectancy[edit]

   i cannot tell why some things hold for me
   a sense of unplumbed marvels to befall
   or of a rift in the horizons wall
   opening to worlds where only gods can be
   there is a breathless vague expectancy
   as of vast ancient pomps i half recall
   or wild adventures uncorporeal
   ecstasyfraught and as a daydream free

   it is in sunsets and strange city spires
   old villages and woods and misty downs
   south winds the sea low hills and lighted towns
   old gardens halfheard songs and the moons fires
   but though its lure alone makes life worth living
   none gains or guesses what it hints at giving

xxix nostalgia[edit]

   once every year in autumns wistful glow
   the birds fly out over an ocean waste
   calling and chattering in a joyous haste
   to reach some land their inner memories know
   great terraced gardens where bright blossoms blow
   and lines of mangoes luscious to the taste
   and templegroves with branches interlaced
   over cool paths  all these their vague dreams shew

   they search the sea for marks of their old shore 
   for the tall city white and turreted 
   but only empty waters stretch ahead
   so that at last they turn away once more
   yet sunken deep where alien polyps throng
   the old towers miss their lost remembered song

xxx background[edit]

   i never can be tied to raw new things
   for i first saw the light in an old town
   where from my window huddled roofs sloped down
   to a quaint harbour rich with visionings
   streets with carved doorways where the sunset beams
   flooded old fanlights and small windowpanes
   and georgian steeples topped with gilded vanes 
   these were the sights that shaped my childhood dreams

   such treasures left from times of cautious leaven
   cannot but loose the hold of flimsier wraiths
   that flit with shifting ways and muddled faiths
   across the changeless walls of earth and heaven
   they cut the moments thongs and leave me free
   to stand alone before eternity

xxxi the dweller[edit]

   it had been old when babylon was new;
   none knows how long it slept beneath that mound
   where in the end our questing shovels found
   its granite blocks and brought it back to view
   there were vast pavements and foundationwalls
   and crumbling slabs and statues carved to shew
   fantastic beings of some long ago
   past anything the world of man recalls

   and then we saw those stone steps leading down
   through a choked gate of graven dolomite
   to some black haven of eternal night
   where elder signs and primal secrets frown
   we cleared a path  but raced in mad retreat
   when from below we heard those clumping feet

xxxii alienation[edit]

   his solid flesh had never been away
   for each dawn found him in his usual place
   but every night his spirit loved to race
   through gulfs and worlds remote from common day
   he had seen yaddith yet retained his mind
   and come back safely from the ghooric zone
   when one still night across curved space was thrown
   that beckoning piping from the voids behind

   he waked that morning as an older man
   and nothing since has looked the same to him
   objects around float nebulous and dim 
   false phantom trifles of some vaster plan
   his folk and friends are now an alien throng
   to which he struggles vainly to belong

xxxiii harbour whistles[edit]

   over old roofs and past decaying spires
   the harbour whistles chant all through the night;
   throats from strange ports and beaches far and white
   and fabulous oceans ranged in motley choirs
   each to the other alien and unknown
   yet all by some obscurely focussed force
   from brooding gulfs beyond the zodiacs course
   fused into one mysterious cosmic drone

   through shadowy dreams they send a marching line
   of still more shadowy shapes and hints and views;
   echoes from outer voids and subtle clues
   to things which they themselves cannot define
   and always in that chorus faintly blent
   we catch some notes no earthship ever sent

xxxiv recapture[edit]

   the way led down a dark halfwooded heath
   where mossgrey boulders humped above the mould
   and curious drops disquieting and cold
   sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath
   there was no wind nor any trace of sound
   in puzzling shrub or alienfeatured tree
   nor any view before  till suddenly
   straight in my path i saw a monstrous mound

   half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread
   rankgrassed and cluttered by a crumbling flight
   of lava stairs that scaled the feartopped height
   in steps too vast for any human tread
   i shrieked  and knew what primal star and year
   had sucked me back from mans dreamtransient sphere!

xxxv evening star[edit]

   i saw it from that hidden silent place
   where the old wood half shuts the meadow in
   it shone through all the sunsets glories  thin
   at first but with a slowly brightening face
   night came and that lone beacon amberhued
   beat on my sight as never it did of old;
   the evening star  but grown a thousandfold
   more haunting in this hush and solitude

   it traced strange pictures on the quivering air 
   halfmemories that had always filled my eyes 
   vast towers and gardens; curious seas and skies
   of some dim life  i never could tell where
   but now i knew that through the cosmic dome
   those rays were calling from my far lost home

xxxvi continuity[edit]

   there is in certain ancient things a trace
   of some dim essence  more than form or weight;
   a tenuous aether indeterminate
   yet linked with all the laws of time and space
   a faint veiled sign of continuities
   that outward eyes can never quite descry;
   of locked dimensions harbouring years gone by
   and out of reach except for hidden keys

   it moves me most when slanting sunbeams glow
   on old farm buildings set against a hill
   and paint with life the shapes which linger still
   from centuries less a dream than this we know
   in that strange light i feel i am not far
   from the fixt mass whose sides the ages are

   since the publication of my h p lovecraft: a bibliography (biblio
   press 1952) i have been repeatedly urged to write out my opinion of
   lovecrafts work i have been kept from doing so by the pressure of a
   fulltime library job plus my own creative work in the diverse fields
   of the horror story the western story and poetry as well as the
   semiannual publication of essence and other timeconsuming activities
   such as an unending struggle against censorship groups which are
   violating constitutional rights on both a local and national level

   the following brief essay is an admittedly hurried and incomplete
   attempt to meet demands for a lovecraft critique an entire book
   requiring many months of uninterrupted work could be devoted to the
   project and i sincerely regret that circumstances do not permit me to
   undertake such a task but i hope that my comments in spite of their
   brevity will be of some interest

   nearly twenty years have passed since lovecrafts death but
   unfortunately a final evaluation of the man and of his work is still
   not possible his collected poems though due to appear shortly have
   not yet been published his letters either selected or collected have
   not appeared probably some of the pieces which he contributed under
   pseudonyms to little magazines have never been reprinted and of
   course no complete and carefully written biography of the man has ever
   been published

   with the important exception of the poems and letters however all of
   lovecrafts work of any significance has been in print for some years
   it seems doubtful therefore that an evaluation of his work at this
   time will be seriously qualified by future publication

   in his essay on lovecraft tales of the marvellous and the
   ridiculous which originally appeared in the new yorker and was
   later reprinted in his book classics and commercials edmund wilson
   states flatly: lovecraft was not a good writer (before lovecraft
   admirers reach for their shotguns i might point out that edmund wilson
   also refers to no less a literary figure than somerset maugham as
   secondrate and a halftrashy novelist) even though his criticism
   is far too severetoo much of a generalizationwilson does call
   attention to two lovecraft faults which i must reluctantly acknowledge:
   his frequent prolixity and his tendency to lean on shopworn adjectives
   such as terrible horrible hellish etc to achieve eerie
   effects in a good horror story adjectives such as this are best
   omitted or at least introduced very sparingly beyond these criticisms
   wilson emphasizes the essential weakness and lack of verisimilitude of
   the cthulhu mythos episodes with this too i must grudgingly agree
   and at this point i would like to call attention to the fact that the
   two specific faults mentioned immediately aboveprolixity and
   adjectivitusare more frequently encountered in the mythos stories
   than in any others

   the cthulhu mythos has raised a great commotion over a period of
   years enthusiastic collaborators imitators friends and admirers have
   elevated the cthulhu myth to a pedestal of importance which it scarcely
   deserves the mythos did indeed become the frame for lovecrafts
   later tales but they were not his best tales lovecraft also amused
   himself by employing cthulhu terminology in some of his huge
   correspondence but it now seems doubtful that he attached as much
   importance to the mythos as do some of his disciples!

   many of the cthulhu stories such as the dunwich horror and the
   whisperer in darkness are actually tedious they are too long; our
   interest is apt to flag; our willing suspension of disbelief may not
   hold to the final page all too often we read on without compulsion
   without belief without very much actual enthusiasm

   lovecraft often seems so intent on introducing and exploiting the
   mythos he loses sight of some of the basic elements which are
   essential in a good short story: economy of wordage verisimilitude
   mounting suspense sweeping to a single climax followed quickly by the
   final denouement

   referring to the mythos edmund wilson concluded: it is all more
   amusing in his letters than it is in the stories themselves of course
   it was not intended to be amusing in the stories but i think wilsons
   meaning is clear

   when it still possessed the freshness of novelty the cthulhu mythology
   afforded a vast amount of entertainment but with the passage of time
   the novelty has evaporated and the myth has become threadbare
   lovecraft used it in story after story and his disciples have exploited
   it since his death and it now seems wrung nearly dry of interesting
   effects

   it remains of course an integral part of the bulk of lovecrafts
   work to attempt to dismiss it as incidental or unimportant would be to
   close our eyes to the facts

   in my opinion however lovecrafts future reputation as a writer of
   fine horror stories will rest on a very few of his early tales in which
   the cthulhu mythos is either entirely absent or at most still in its
   formative stages in lovecrafts own mind these early stories which i
   mean to mention were published prior to the appearance of the first
   generally accepted mythos story: the call of cthulhu (weird tales
   february 1928)

   these stories are: the hound (weird tales february 1924); the rats
   in the walls (weird tales march 1924); the music of erich zann
   (weird tales may 1925); the outsider (weird tales april 1926);
   pickmans model (weird tales october 1927)

   of these i think the best of all is the music of erich zann this
   piece which might have been written by poe has everything which many
   of the mythos tales lack: compression sustained and rising suspense
   culminating in a powerfully effective climax followed almost
   immediately by the end of the story stylistically and structurally i
   think lovecraft never surpassed it i think it probable that the old
   german mute will go on sawing his accursed viol in that ghoulinfested
   garret long after great cthulhu has lapsed into silence! this story
   like poes masterpiece the cask of amontillado seems literally
   above criticism there are no wasted words the brief story unfolds
   with a remorseless inevitability nothing could be omitted nothing
   added nothing changed which would improve its quality in its
   particular genre it remains a pure masterpiece

   after the music of erich zann i would cite the rats in the walls
   actually i very nearly voted it first place because it achieves a
   pitch of sheer grisly horror which exceeds the taut terror of the
   music of erich zann on the other hand it does not possess quite the
   same degree of purity and compression but it is a masterpiece of its
   type and again i can think of no lovecraft story after the music of
   erich zann which equals it as a matter of fact one almost feels that
   lovecraft has gone too far in this particular story something inside
   one rebels as the ghastly eldrich grottos reveal their loathsome
   secrets perhaps it is simply that one instinctively refuses to believe
   that homo sapiens could ever descend to such a hellish sublevel but
   this is a philosophical comment not a criticism of the story

   the rats in the walls begins in the somewhat leisurely manner which
   has come to be associated with rather oldfashioned gothic ghost
   stories and for some little time nothing really hairraising happens
   but once the full horror comes to light it simply overwhelms us we
   see at once that the leisurely start was intended to lull us a little
   certainly it kept us interested enough to continue and we did perhaps
   expect some pretty formidable horrorsbut nothing like what we finally
   encounter! for sheer inhuman horror those twilit grottos under the evil
   foundations of exham priory have yet to be surpassed

   in his introduction to best supernatural stories of h p  lovecraft
   august derleth states: it has been said of the outsider that if the
   manuscript had been put forward as an unpublished tale by edgar allan
   poe none would have challenged it perhaps this is not literally
   true but i agree with the spirit of it the outsider is one of
   lovecrafts finest stories it possesses the merit of compression; with
   rising intensity it achieves its single shuddery effectand ends some
   aspects of this story call to mind poes the masque of the red death;
   both stories achieve their effects with a minimum of wordage both
   linger in the mind

   pickmans model is one of lovecrafts strongest stories it has unity
   of effect suspense a highly original plot idea and a climax which
   neatly and forcefully ends the story it is not quite as tightly knit
   as the music of erich zann or the outsider but it is still
   lovecraft writing at his toplevel best the nameless blasphemy with
   glaring red eyes gnawing at a human head would probably feel at home
   in one of those unspeakable grottos under the infamous walls of exham
   priory!

   i have mentioned lovecrafts the hound because it has remained in my
   mind after i first read it many years ago its structure is somewhat
   slight and it does not have the power of lovecrafts very best tales
   but it has splendid atmosphere and again brevity and unity of effect
   it might have been written by the early poe but i cite it primarily
   because it has lingered long in my mind

   the limitations of this little critique do not permit me to touch on
   many other good lovecraft stories i have mentioned only five which i
   think are the best i am merely expressing a personal opiniona
   personal tasteand i am more than willing to admit of other
   opinionsno matter how they may differ from my own time alone will
   decide who is right!

   i have not yet seen all of lovecrafts poetry but i think i have seen
   enough to comment briefly much of the poetry falls into two main
   categories: deliberately archaic work imitative of eighteenthcentury
   verse and a group of weird sonnets known as fungi from yuggoth the
   imitative verse is interesting and often competent but i think the
   fungi sonnets are far more arresting and effective a few of the very
   best of them may survive

   any criticism of lovecrafts work no matter how brief would be
   incomplete if it omitted mention of his famous essay supernatural
   horror in literature even edmund wilson concedes that the essay is a
   really able piece of work in my pamphlet h p lovecraft: a
   bibliography i commented: the background and evolution of the horror
   talea must for anyone seriously interested in the genre the
   comment still holds apart from the letters i think it is probably the
   finest piece of nonfiction which lovecraft ever wrote

   judging from the few letters and extracts from letters which are in
   print lovecrafts selected letters (or collected) will definitely
   enhance his reputation it is probable that their publication will
   revive and intensify interest in both the man and his work lovecrafts
   erudition humor and style is such that it is even possible they will
   eventually tend to eclipse his other work! at this point we can only
   wait and see

   lovecrafts final place in american literature has not yet been
   determined it is too early for that but it seems certain that the
   very best of his work will endure that it will remain important in the
   particular field which he chose if he did not reach the summits
   attained by poe or bierce at his best he scaled some dizzy heights

   note

   this bibliography is a direct outgrowth of my earlier privately
   printed select bibliography of h p lovecraft it contains most of
   the information which was not included in that original checklista
   complete list of the short stories all the anthologies additional
   title and other pertinent items of interest also many of the
   annotations which appeared in the earlier checklist have herein been
   revised and enlarged

   i am immensely indebted to august derleth for his enthusiastic and
   wholehearted assistance he has supplied me with much vital information
   which it would have been virtually impossible for me to obtain unaided
   while busy with his own work he took time out to read the original
   manuscript of the bibliography and to point out important corrections
   and additions

   also i wish to extend wholehearted thanks to miss marion e brown in
   charge special collections brown university library for her kindness
   in listing and describing various lovecraft items at brown which are
   under her care without her generous contributions of both patience and
   time most of these items would probably have remained inaccessible to
   me 

   i am solely responsible however for any errors which may come to
   light

   the steeples are white in the wild moonlight
      and the trees have a silver glare;
   past the chimneys high see the vampires fly
      and the harpies of upper air
      that flutter and laugh and stare

   for the village dead to the moon outspread
      never shone in the sunsets gleam
   but grew out of the deep that the dead years keep
      where the rivers of madness stream
      down the gulfs to a pit of dream

   a chill wind weaves through the rows of sheaves
      in the meadows that shimmer pale
   and comes to twine where the headstones shine
      and the ghouls of the churchyard wail
      for harvests that fly and fail

   not a breath of the strange grey gods of change
      that tore from the past its own
   can quicken this hour when a spectral power
      spreads sleep oer the cosmic throne
      and looses the vast unknown

   so here again stretch the vale and plain
      that moons longforgotten saw
   and the dead leap gay in the pallid ray
      sprung out of the tombs black maw
      to shake all the world with awe

   and all that the morn shall greet forlorn
      the ugliness and the pest
   of rows where thick rise the stones and brick
      shall some day be with the rest
      and brood with the shades unblest

   then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark
      and the leprous spires ascend;
   for new and old alike in the fold
      of horror and death are penned
      for the hounds of time to rend

   tales september 1926 excerpted from he (short story) on wikipedia
   the free encyclopedia

   i saw him on a sleepless night when i was walking desperately to save
   my soul and my vision my coming to new york had been a mistake; for
   whereas i had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming
   labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten
   courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and
   waterfronts equally forgotten and in the cyclopean modern towers and
   pinnacles that rise blackly babylonian under waning moons i had found
   instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to
   master paralyze and annihilate me

   the disillusion had been gradual coming for the first time upon the
   town i had seen it in the sunset from a bridge majestic above its
   waters its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and
   delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming clouds and
   the first stars of evening then it had lighted up window by window
   above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep
   horns bayed weird harmonies and had itself become a starry firmament
   of dream redolent of faery music and one with the marvels of
   carcassonne and samarcand and el dorado and all glorious and
   halffabulous cities shortly afterward i was taken through those
   antique ways so dear to my fancynarrow curving alleys and passages
   where rows of red georgian brick blinked with smallpaned dormers above
   pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and paneled
   coachesand in the first flush of realization of these longwished
   things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me
   in time a poet

   but success and happiness were not to be garish daylight showed only
   squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing
   spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder
   magic; and the throngs of people that seethed through the flumelike
   streets were squat swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow
   eyes shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes
   about them who could never mean aught to a blueeyed man of the old
   folk with the love of fair green lanes and white new england village
   steeples in his heart

   so instead of the poems i had hoped for there came only a shuddering
   blackness and ineffable loneliness; and i saw at last a fearful truth
   which no one had ever dared to breathe beforethe unwhisperable secret
   of secretsthe fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a
   sentient perpetuation of old new york as london is of old london and
   paris of old paris but that it is in fact quite dead its sprawling
   body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which
   have nothing to do with it as it was in life upon making this
   discovery i ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned
   tranquillity came back as i gradually formed the habit of keeping off
   the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night when darkness
   calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraithlike about and
   old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through
   them with this mode of relief i even wrote a few poems and still
   refrained from going home to my people lest i seem to crawl back
   ignobly in defeat

   then on a sleepless nights walk i met the man it was in a grotesque
   hidden courtyard of the greenwich section for there in my ignorance i
   had settled having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and
   artists the archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and
   court had indeed delighted me and when i found the poets and artists
   to be loudvoiced pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives
   are a denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art i stayed
   on for love of these venerable things i fancied them as they were in
   their prime when greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by
   the town; and in the hours before dawn when all the revellers had
   slunk away i used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and
   brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited
   there this kept my soul alive and gave me a few of those dreams and
   visions for which the poet far within me cried out

   the man came upon me at about two one cloudy august morning as i was
   threading a series of detached courtyards; now accessible only through
   the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings but once forming parts
   of a continuous network of picturesque alleys i had heard of them by
   vague rumor and realized that they could not be upon any map of today;
   but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me so that
   i had sought them with twice my usual eagerness now that i had found
   them my eagerness was again redoubled; for something in their
   arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such
   with dark dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls
   and deserted rear tenements or lurking lamplessly behind archways
   unbetrayed by hordes of the foreignspeaking or guarded by furtive and
   uncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite publicity or the
   light of day

   he spoke to me without invitation noting my mood and glances as i
   studied certain knockered doorways above ironrailed steps the pallid
   glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face his own face was in
   shadow and he wore a widebrimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly
   with the outofdate cloak he affected; but i was subtly disquieted
   even before he addressed me his form was very slight; thin almost to
   cadaverousness; and his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow
   though not particularly deep he had he said noticed me several times
   at my wanderings; and inferred that i resembled him in loving the
   vestiges of former years would i not like the guidance of one long
   practiced in these explorations and possessed of local information
   profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly
   have gained?

   as he spoke i caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a
   solitary attic window it was a noble even a handsome elderly
   countenance; and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for
   the age and place yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as
   much as its features pleased meperhaps it was too white or too
   expressionless or too much out of keeping with the locality to make
   me feel easy or comfortable nevertheless i followed him; for in those
   dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had
   to keep my soul alive and i reckoned it a rare favor of fate to fall
   in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much
   farther than mine

   something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a
   long hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the
   briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes
   and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed
   through interstices tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick
   walls and once crawled on hands and knees through a low arched
   passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at
   last every hint of geographical location i had managed to preserve the
   things we saw were very old and marvelous or at least they seemed so
   in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them and i shall
   never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and
   urnheaded iron fenceposts and flaringlinteled windows and decorative
   fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we
   advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity

   we met no person and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer
   and fewer the streetlights we first encountered had been of oil and
   of the ancient lozenge pattern later i noticed some with candles; and
   at last after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had
   to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooded
   gate in a high wall we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by
   lanterns in front of every seventh houseunbelievably colonial tin
   lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides this alley
   led steeply uphillmore steeply than i thought possible in this part
   of new yorkand the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivyclad
   wall of a private estate beyond which i could see a pale cupola and
   the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky in this
   wall was a small lowarched gate of nailstudded black oak which the
   man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key leading me within he
   steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel
   path and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house
   which he unlocked and opened for me

   we entered and as we did so i grew faint from a reek of infinite
   mustiness which welled out to meet us and which must have been the
   fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay my host appeared not to notice
   this and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving
   stairway across a hall and into a room whose door i heard him lock
   behind us then i saw him pull the curtains of the three smallpaned
   windows that barely showed themselves against the lightening sky; after
   which he crossed to the mantel struck flint and steel lighted two
   candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces and made a gesture
   enjoining softtoned speech

   in this feeble radiance i saw that we were in a spacious
   wellfurnished and paneled library dating from the first quarter of the
   eighteenth century with splendid doorway pediments a delightful doric
   cornice and a magnificently carved overmantel with scrollandurn top
   above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were
   wellwrought family portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness
   and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to
   a chair beside the graceful chippendale table before seating himself
   across the table from me my host paused for a moment as if in
   embarrassment; then tardily removing his gloves widebrimmed hat and
   cloak stood theatrically revealed in full midgeorgian costume from
   queued hair and neck ruffles to kneebreeches silk hose and the
   buckled shoes i had not previously noticed now slowly sinking into a
   lyreback chair he commenced to eye me intently

   without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely
   visible before and i wondered if this unperceived mark of singular
   longevity were not one of the sources of my disquiet when he spoke at
   length his soft hollow and carefully muffled voice not infrequently
   quavered; and now and then i had great difficulty in following him as i
   listened with a thrill of amazement and halfdisavowed alarm which grew
   each instant

   you behold sir my host began a man of very eccentrical habits for
   whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and
   inclinations reflecting upon better times i have not scrupled to
   ascertain their ways and adopt their dress and manners; an indulgence
   which offends none if practised without ostentation it hath been my
   good fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors swallowed though
   it was by two towns first greenwich which built up hither after 1800
   then new york which joined on near 1830 there were many reasons for
   the close keeping of this place in my family and i have not been
   remiss in discharging such obligations the squire who succeeded to it
   in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries all
   connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground
   and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding some curious effects
   of these arts and discoveries i now purpose to show you under the
   strictest secrecy; and i believe i may rely on my judgement of men
   enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity

   he paused but i could only nod my head i have said that i was
   alarmed yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material
   daylight world of new york and whether this man were a harmless
   eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts i had no choice save to
   follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to
   offer so i listened

   tomy ancestor he softly continued there appeared to reside some
   very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a
   littlesuspected dominance not only over the acts of ones self and of
   others but over every variety of force and substance in nature and
   over many elements and dimensions deemed more universal than nature
   herself may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as
   space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain
   halfbreed red indians once encamped upon this hill? these indians
   showed choler when the place was built and were plaguey pestilent in
   asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon for years they
   stole over the wall each month when they could and by stealth
   performed sartain acts then in 68 the new squire catched them at
   their doings and stood still at what he saw thereafter he bargained
   with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact
   inwardness of what they did larning that their grandfathers got part
   of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old dutchman in the
   time of the statesgeneral and pox on him im afeared the squire must
   have sarved them monstrous bad rumwhether or not by intentfor a
   week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it
   you sir are the first outsider to be told there is a secret and
   split me if id have risked tampering that much withthe powershad
   ye not been so hot after bygone things

   i shuddered as the man grew colloquialand with the familiar speech of
   another day he went on

   but you must know sir that whatthe squiregot from those mongrel
   savages was but a small part of the larning he came to have he had not
   been at oxford for nothing nor talked to no account with an ancient
   chymist and astrologer in paris he was in fine made sensible that
   all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of
   the vulgar but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any
   cloud of prime virginia tobacco what we want we may make about us;
   and what we dont want we may sweep away i wont say that all this is
   wholly true in body but tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty
   spectacle now and then you i conceive would be tickled by a better
   sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you; so be pleased
   to hold back any fright at what i design to show come to the window
   and be quiet

   my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the
   long side of the malodorous room and at the first touch of his
   ungloved fingers i turned cold his flesh though dry and firm was of
   the quality of ice; and i almost shrank away from his pulling but
   again i thought of the emptiness and horror of reality and boldly
   prepared to follow whithersoever i might be led once at the window
   the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into
   the blackness outside for a moment i saw nothing save a myriad of tiny
   dancing lights far far before me then as if in response to an
   insidious motion of my hosts hand a flash of heatlightning played
   over the scene and i looked out upon a sea of luxuriant
   foliagefoliage unpolluted and not the sea of roofs to be expected by
   any normal mind on my right the hudson glittered wickedly and in the
   distance ahead i saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh
   constellated with nervous fireflies the flash died and an evil smile
   illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer

   that was before my timebefore the new squires time pray let us try
   again

   i was faint even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed
   city had made me

   good god! i whispered can you do that for any time? and as he
   nodded and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs
   i clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling but he
   steadied me with that terrible icecold claw and once more made his
   insidious gesture

   again the lightning flashedbut this time upon a scene not wholly
   strange it was greenwich the greenwich that used to be with here and
   there a roof or row of houses as we see it now yet with lovely green
   lanes and fields and bits of grassy common the marsh still glittered
   beyond but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then
   all of new york; trinity and st pauls and the brick church dominating
   their sisters and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole
   i breathed hard but not so much from the sight itself as from the
   possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up

   can youdare yougo far? i spoke with awe and i think he shared it
   for a second but the evil grin returned

   far? what i have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone! back
   backforward forwardlook ye puling lackwit!

   and as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing
   to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before for
   full three seconds i could glimpse that pandemoniac sight and in those
   seconds i saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams i
   saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things and beneath them
   a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids
   flung savagely to the moon and devillights burning from unnumbered
   windows and swarming loathsomely on aerial galleries i saw the yellow
   squinteyed people of that city robed horribly in orange and red and
   dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettledrums the clatter
   of obscene crotala and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose
   ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the wave of an
   unhallowed ocean of bitumen

   i saw this vista i say and heard as with the minds ear the
   blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it it was the
   shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpsecity had ever
   stirred in my soul and forgetting every injunction to silence i
   screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls
   quivered about me

   then as the flash subsided i saw that my host was trembling too; a
   look of shocking fear halfblotting from his face the serpent
   distortion of rage which my screams had excited he tottered clutched
   at the curtains as i had done before and wriggled his head wildly
   like a hunted animal god knows he had cause for as the echoes of my
   screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive
   that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious it was the steady
   stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door as with the
   ascent of a barefoot or skinshod horde; and at last the cautious
   purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble
   candlelight the old man clawed and spat at me through the moldy air
   and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he
   clutched

   the full moondamn yeye    ye yelping dogye called em and
   theyve come for me! moccasined feetdead mengad sink ye ye red
   devils but i poisoned no rum o yourshant i kept your poxrotted
   magic safeye swilled yourselves sick curse ye and yet must needs
   blame the squirelet go you! unhand that latchive naught for ye
   here

   at this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of
   the door and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic
   magician his fright turning to steely despair left room for a
   resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward the
   table on whose edge i was steadying myself the curtains still
   clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me grew taut and
   finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room
   a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had
   presaged in those greenish beams the candles paled and a new
   semblance of decay spread over the muskreeking room with its wormy
   paneling sagging floor battered mantel rickety furniture and ragged
   draperies it spread over the old man too whether from the same
   source or because of his fear and vehemence and i saw him shrivel and
   blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons
   only his eyes stayed whole and they glared with a propulsive dilated
   incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled

   the rapping was now repeated with greater insistence and this time
   bore a hint of metal the black thing facing me had become only a head
   with eyes impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my
   direction and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal
   malice now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels and
   i saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood i did not
   move for i could not; but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces
   to admit a colossal shapeless influx of inky substance starred with
   shining malevolent eyes it poured thickly like a flood of oil
   bursting a rotten bulkhead overturned a chair as it spread and
   finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the
   blackened head with the eyes still glared at me around that head it
   closed totally swallowing it up and in another moment it had begun to
   recede; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me and
   flowing again out that black doorway and down the unseen stairs which
   creaked as before though in reverse order

   then the floor gave way at last and i slid gaspingly down into the
   nighted chamber below choking with cobwebs and halfswooning with
   terror the green moon shining through broken windows showed me the
   hall door half open; and as i rose from the plasterstrewn floor and
   twisted myself free from the sagged ceiling i saw sweep past it an
   awful torrent of blackness with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it
   it was seeking the door to the cellar and when it found it vanished
   therein i now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the
   upper chamber had done and once a crashing above had been followed by
   the fall past the west window of some thing which must have been the
   cupola now liberated for the instant from the wreckage i rushed
   through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open
   it seized a chair and broke a window climbing frenziedly out upon the
   unkempt lawn where moon light danced over yardhigh grass and weeds
   the wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of
   boxes in a corner i managed to gain the top and cling to the great
   stone urn set there

   about me in my exhaustion i could see only strange walls and windows
   and old gambrel roofs the steep street of my approach was nowhere
   visible and the little i did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that
   rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight suddenly the
   urn to which i clung began to tremble as if sharing my own lethal
   dizziness; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to i
   knew not what fate

   the man who found me said that i must have crawled a long way despite
   my broken bones for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared
   look the gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my
   ordeal and reports could state no more than that i had appeared from a
   place unknown at the entrance to a little black court off perry
   street

   i never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths nor would i
   direct any sane man thither if i could of who or what that ancient
   creature was i have no idea; but i repeat that the city is dead and
   full of unsuspected horrors whither he has gone i do not know; but i
   have gone home to the pure new england lanes up which fragrant
   seawinds sweep at evening

   history of the necronomicon
   by h p lovecraft
   written 1927 published 1938
   12042history of the necronomiconh p lovecraft

   original title al azif  azif being the word used by arabs to
   designate that nocturnal sound (made by insects) supposd to be the
   howling of daemons

   composed by abdul alhazred a mad poet of sanaá in yemen who is said
   to have flourished during the period of the ommiade caliphs circa 700
   ad he visited the ruins of babylon and the subterranean secrets of
   memphis and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of
   arabia  the roba el khaliyeh or empty space of the ancients  and
   dahna or crimson desert of the modern arabs which is held to be
   inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death of this
   desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who
   pretend to have penetrated it in his last years alhazred dwelt in
   damascus where the necronomicon (al azif) was written and of his
   final death or disappearance (738 ad) many terrible and conflicting
   things are told he is said by ebn khallikan (12th cent biographer) to
   have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured
   horribly before a large number of frightfrozen witnesses of his
   madness many things are told he claimed to have seen fabulous irem or
   city of pillars and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain
   nameless desert town the shocking annals and secrets of a race older
   than mankind he was only an indifferent moslem worshipping unknown
   entities whom he called yogsothoth and cthulhu

   in ad 950 the azif which had gained a considerable tho
   surreptitious circulation amongst the philosophers of the age was
   secretly translated into greek by theodorus philetas of constantinople
   under the title necronomicon for a century it impelled certain
   experimenters to terrible attempts when it was suppressed and burnt by
   the patriarch michael after this it is only heard of furtively but
   (1228) olaus wormius made a latin translation later in the middle ages
   and the latin text was printed twice  once in the fifteenth century
   in blackletter (evidently in germany) and once in the seventeenth
   (prob spanish)  both editions being without identifying marks and
   located as to time and place by internal typographical evidence only
   the work both latin and greek was banned by pope gregory ix in 1232
   shortly after its latin translation which called attention to it the
   arabic original was lost as early as wormius time as indicated by his
   prefatory note; and no sight of the greek copy  which was printed in
   italy between 1500 and 1550  has been reported since the burning of a
   certain salem mans library in 1692 an english translation made by dr
   dee was never printed and exists only in fragments recovered from the
   original manuscript of the latin texts now existing one (15th cent)
   is known to be in the british museum under lock and key while another
   (17th cent) is in the bibliothèque nationale at paris a
   seventeenthcentury edition is in the widener library at harvard and
   in the library of miskatonic university at arkham also in the library
   of the university of buenos aires numerous other copies probably exist
   in secret and a fifteenthcentury one is persistently rumoured to form
   part of the collection of a celebrated american millionaire a still
   vaguer rumour credits the preservation of a sixteenthcentury greek
   text in the salem family of pickman; but if it was so preserved it
   vanished with the artist r u pickman who disappeared early in 1926
   the book is rigidly suppressed by the authorities of most countries
   and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism reading leads to
   terrible consequences it was from rumours of this book (of which
   relatively few of the general public know) that robert w chambers is
   said to have derived the idea of his early novel the king in yellow

   homecoming

   the daemon said that he would take me home
   to the pale shadowy land i halfrecalled
   as a high place of stair and terrace walled
   with marble balustrades that skywinds comb
   while miles below a maze of dome on dome
   and tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled
   once more he told me i would stand enthralled
   on those old heights and hear the faroff foam

   all this he promised and through sunsets gate
   he swept me past the lapping lakes of flame
   and redgold thrones of gods without a name
   who shriek in fear at some impending fate
   then a black gulf with seasounds in the night:
   here was your home he mocked when you had sight!

     apropos of sleep that sinister adventure of all our nights we may
     say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be
     incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of
     ignorance of the danger

                                                               baudelaire

   may the merciful gods if indeed there be such guard those hours when
   no power of the will or drug that the cunning of man devises can keep
   me from the chasm of sleep death is merciful for there is no return
   therefrom but with him who has come back out of the nethermost
   chambers of night haggard and knowing peace rests nevermore fool
   that i was to plunge with such unsanctioned frensy into mysteries no
   man was meant to penetrate; fool or god that he was  my only friend
   who led me and went before me and who in the end passed into terrors
   which may yet be mine!

   we met i recall in a railway station where he was the center of a
   crowd of the vulgarly curious he was unconscious having fallen in a
   kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight blackclad body a
   strange rigidity i think he was then approaching forty years of age
   for there were deep lines in the face wan and hollowcheeked but oval
   and actually beautiful; and touches of gray in the thick waving hair
   and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black
   his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus and of a height and
   breadth almost godlike

   i said to myself with all the ardor of a sculptor that this man was a
   fauns statue out of antique hellas dug from a temples ruins and
   brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and
   pressure of devastating years and when he opened his immense sunken
   and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only
   friend the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before
   for i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and
   the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms
   which i had cherished in fancy but vainly sought so as i drove the
   crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and
   leader in unfathomed mysteries and he assented without speaking a
   word afterward i found that his voice was music the music of deep
   viols and of crystalline spheres we talked often in the night and in
   the day when i chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in
   ivory to immortalize his different expressions

   of our studies it is impossible to speak since they held so slight a
   connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it they
   were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and
   consciousness which lies deeper than matter time and space and whose
   existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep those rare dreams
   beyond dreams which come never to common men and but once or twice in
   the lifetime of imaginative men the cosmos of our waking knowledge
   born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a
   jester touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source
   when sucked back by the jesters whim men of learning suspect it
   little and ignore it mostly wise men have interpreted dreams and the
   gods have laughed one man with oriental eyes has said that all time
   and space are relative and men have laughed but even that man with
   oriental eyes has done no more than suspect i had wished and tried to
   do more than suspect and my friend had tried and partly succeeded
   then we both tried together and with exotic drugs courted terrible and
   forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manorhouse in
   hoary kent

   among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments
   inarticulateness what i learned and saw in those hours of impious
   exploration can never be told for want of symbols or suggestions in
   any language i say this because from first to last our discoveries
   partook only of the nature of sensations; sensations correlated with no
   impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of
   receiving they were sensations yet within them lay unbelievable
   elements of time and space things which at bottom possess no distinct
   and definite existence human utterance can best convey the general
   character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for
   in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away
   from all that is real and present rushing aerially along shocking
   unlighted and fearhaunted abysses and occasionally tearing through
   certain wellmarked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous
   uncouth clouds of vapors

   in these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and
   sometimes together when we were together my friend was always far
   ahead; i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a
   species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me golden
   from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty its
   anomalously youthful cheeks its burning eyes its olympian brow and
   its shadowing hair and growth of beard

   of the progress of time we kept no record for time had become to us
   the merest illusion i know only that there must have been something
   very singular involved since we came at length to marvel why we did
   not grow old our discourse was unholy and always hideously ambitious
    no god or demon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like
   those which we planned in whispers i shiver as i speak of them and
   dare not be explicit; though i will say that my friend once wrote on
   paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue and which made
   me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the
   spangled night sky i will hint only hint that he had designs which
   involved the rulership of the visible universe and more; designs
   whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command and the
   destinies of all living things be his i affirm i swear that i had no
   share in these extreme aspirations anything my friend may have said or
   written to the contrary must be erroneous for i am no man of strength
   to risk the unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve
   success

   there was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us
   irresistibly into limitless vacum beyond all thought and entity
   perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon
   us; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy
   yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of
   presentation to others viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid
   succession and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of
   greater remoteness than any we had previously known

   my friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean
   of virgin aether and i could see the sinister exultation on his
   floating luminous tooyouthful memoryface suddenly that face became
   dim and quickly disappeared and in a brief space i found myself
   projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate it was like
   the others yet incalculably denser; a sticky clammy mass if such
   terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a nonmaterial sphere

   i had i felt been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had
   successfully passed struggling anew i came to the end of the
   drugdream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose
   opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my
   fellow dreamer weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed
   goldgreen light on his marble features

   then after a short interval the form in the corner stirred; and may
   pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that
   which took place before me i cannot tell you how he shrieked or what
   vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed
   with fright i can only say that i fainted and did not stir till he
   himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away
   the horror and desolation

   that was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream
   awed shaken and portentous my friend who had been beyond the barrier
   warned me that we must never venture within those realms again what he
   had seen he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we
   must sleep as little as possible even if drugs were necessary to keep
   us awake that he was right i soon learned from the unutterable fear
   which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed

   after each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older whilst my friend
   aged with a rapidity almost shocking it is hideous to see wrinkles
   form and hair whiten almost before ones eyes our mode of life was now
   totally altered heretofore a recluse so far as i know his true name
   and origin never having passed his lips my friend now became frantic
   in his fear of solitude at night he would not be alone nor would the
   company of a few persons calm him his sole relief was obtained in
   revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies
   of the young and gay were unknown to us

   our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which
   i keenly resented but which my friend considered a lesser evil than
   solitude especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the
   stars were shining and if forced to this condition he would often
   glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing
   therein he did not always glance at the same place in the sky it
   seemed to be a different place at different times on spring evenings
   it would be low in the northeast in the summer it would be nearly
   overhead in the autumn it would be in the northwest in winter it
   would be in the east but mostly if in the small hours of morning

   midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him only after two years
   did i connect this fear with anything in particular; but then i began
   to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault
   whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his
   glance a spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealis

   we now had a studio in london never separating but never discussing
   the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world
   we were aged and weak from our drugs dissipations and nervous
   overstrain and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become
   snowwhite our freedom from long sleep was surprising for seldom did
   we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had
   now grown so frightful a menace

   then came one january of fog and rain when money ran low and drugs
   were hard to buy my statues and ivory heads were all sold and i had
   no means to purchase new materials or energy to fashion them even had
   i possessed them we suffered terribly and on a certain night my
   friend sank into a deepbreathing sleep from which i could not awaken
   him i can recall the scene now the desolate pitchblack garret
   studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of our
   lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the
   dressingtable; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part
   of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space;
   and worst of all the deep steady sinister breathing of my friend on
   the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of
   supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres
   forbidden unimagined and hideously remote

   the tension of my vigil became oppressive and a wild train of trivial
   impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind
   i heard a clock strike somewhere not ours for that was not a striking
   clock and my morbid fancy found in this a new startingpoint for idle
   wanderings clocks time space infinity and then my fancy reverted
   to the locale as i reflected that even now beyond the roof and the fog
   and the rain and the atmosphere corona borealis was rising in the
   northeast corona borealis which my friend had appeared to dread and
   whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen
   through the measureless abysses of aether all at once my feverishly
   sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in
   the soft medley of drugmagnified sounds a low and damnably insistent
   whine from very far away; droning clamoring mocking calling from
   the northeast

   but it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and
   set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed;
   not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which
   caused lodgers and police to break down the door it was not what i
   heard but what i saw; for in that dark locked shuttered and
   curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft
   of horrible redgold light a shaft which bore with it no glow to
   disperse the darkness but which streamed only upon the recumbent head
   of the troubled sleeper bringing out in hideous duplication the
   luminous and strangely youthful memoryface as i had known it in dreams
   of abysmal space and unshackled time when my friend had pushed behind
   the barrier to those secret innermost and forbidden caverns of
   nightmare

   and as i looked i beheld the head rise the black liquid and
   deepsunken eyes open in terror and the thin shadowed lips part as if
   for a scream too frightful to be uttered there dwelt in that ghastly
   and flexible face as it shone bodiless luminous and rejuvenated in
   the blackness more of stark teeming brainshattering fear than all
   the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me

   no word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and
   nearer but as i followed the memoryfaces mad stare along that cursed
   shaft of light to its source the source whence also the whining came
   i too saw for an instant what it saw and fell with ringing ears in
   that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the
   police never could i tell try as i might what it actually was that i
   saw; nor could the still face tell for although it must have seen more
   than i did it will never speak again but always i shall guard against
   the mocking and insatiate hypnos lord of sleep against the night sky
   and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy

   just what happened is unknown for not only was my own mind unseated by
   the strange and hideous thing but others were tainted with a
   forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness they have said i
   know not for what reason that i never had a friend; but that art
   philosophy and insanity had filled all my tragic life the lodgers and
   police on that night soothed me and the doctor administered something
   to quiet me nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place
   my stricken friend moved them to no pity but what they found on the
   couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me and
   now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours bald
   graybearded shriveled palsied drugcrazed and broken adoring and
   praying to the object they found

   for they deny that i sold the last of my statuary and point with
   ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold
   petrified and unvocal it is all that remains of my friend; the friend
   who led me on to madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as
   only old hellas could yield young with the youth that is outside time
   and with beauteous bearded face curved smiling lips olympian brow
   and dense locks waving and poppycrowned they say that that haunting
   memoryface is modeled from my own as it was at twentyfive; but upon
   the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of attica

   ibid  (1938)
   by howard phillips lovecraft

    written 1927/1928 published january 1938 in owashtanong 3 no 1

   70603ibidhoward phillips lovecraft1938

     as ibid says in his famous lives of the poets

                                                    from a student theme

   the erroneous idea that ibid is the author of the lives is so
   frequently met with even among those pretending to a degree of
   culture that it is worth correcting it should be a matter of general
   knowledge that cf is responsible for this work ibids masterpiece on
   the other hand was the famous op cit wherein all the significant
   undercurrents of graecoroman expression were crystallised once for all
    and with admirable acuteness notwithstanding the surprisingly late
   date at which ibid wrote there is a false report very commonly
   reproduced in modern books prior to von schweinkopfs monumental
   geschichte der ostrogothen in italien that ibid was a romanised
   visigoth of ataulfs horde who settled in placentia about 410 a d the
   contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for von schweinkopf and
   since his time littlewit1 and bêtenoir 2 have shewn with irrefutable
   force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine roman or at
   least as genuine a roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could
   produce of whom one might well say what gibbon said of boethius that
   he was the last whom cato or tully could have acknowledged for their
   countryman he was like boethius and nearly all the eminent men of
   his age of the great anician family and traced his genealogy with
   much exactitude and selfsatisfaction to all the heroes of the
   republic his full name  long and pompous according to the custom of
   an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic roman
   nomenclature  is stated by von schweinkopf3 to have been caius anicius
   magnus furius camillus aemilianus cornelius valerius pompeius julius
   ibidus; though littlewit4 rejects aemilianus and adds claudius
   deciusfunianus; whilst bêtenoir5 differs radically giving the full
   name as magnus furius camillus aurelius antoninus flavius anicius
   petronius valentinianus aegidus ibidus

   the eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486 shortly
   after the extinction of the roman rule in gaul by clovis rome and
   ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth though it is certain
   that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the
   schools of athens  the extent of whose suppression by theodosius a
   century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial in 512 under
   the benign rule of the ostrogoth theodoric we behold him as a teacher
   of rhetoric at rome and in 516 he held the consulship together with
   pompilius numantius bombastes marcellinus deodamnatus upon the death
   of theodoric in 526 ibidus retired from public life to compose his
   celebrated work (whose pure ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of
   classic atavism as is the verse of claudius claudianus who flourished
   a century before ibidus); but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp
   to act as court rhetorician for theodatus nephew of theodoric

   upon the usurpation of vitiges ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a
   time imprisoned; but the coming of the byzantineroman army under
   belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours throughout the
   siege of rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders and
   afterward followed the eagles of belisarius to alba porto and
   centumcellae after the frankish siege of milan ibidus was chosen to
   accompany the learned bishop datius to greece and resided with him at
   corinth in the year 539 about 541 he removed to constantinopolis
   where he received every mark of imperial favour both from justinianus
   and justinus the second the emperors tiberius and maurice did kindly
   honour to his old age and contributed much to his immortality 
   especially maurice whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old
   rome notwithstanding his birth at arabiscus in cappadocia it was
   maurice who in the poets 101st year secured the adoption of his work
   as a textbook in the schools of the empire an honour which proved a
   fatal tax on the aged rhetoricians emotions since he passed away
   peacefully at his home near the church of st sophia on the sixth day
   before the kalends of september a d 587 in the 102nd year of his
   age

   his remains notwithstanding the troubled state of italy were taken to
   ravenna for interment; but being interred in the suburb of classe were
   exhumed and ridiculed by the lombard duke of spoleto who took his
   skull to king autharis for use as a wassailbowl ibids skull was
   proudly handed down from king to king of the lombard line upon the
   capture of pavia by charlemagne in 774 the skull was seized from the
   tottering desiderius and carried in the train of the frankish
   conqueror it was from this vessel indeed that pope leo administered
   the royal unction which made of the heronomad a holy roman emperor
   charlemagne took ibids skull to his capital at aix soon after ward
   presenting it to his saxon teacher alcuin upon whose death in 804 it
   was sent to alcuins kinsfolk in england

   william the conqueror finding it in an abbey niche where the pious
   family of alcuin had placed it (believing it to be the skull of a
   saint6 who had miraculously annihilated the lombards by his prayers)
   did reverence to its osseous antiquity; and even the rough soldiers of
   cromwell upon destroying ballylough abbey in ireland in 1650 (it
   having been secretly transported thither by a devout papist in 1539
   upon henry viis dissolution of the english monasteries) declined to
   offer violence to a relic so venerable

   it was captured by the private soldier reademandweep hopkins who
   not long after traded it to restinjehovah stubbs for a quid of new
   virginia weed stubbs upon sending forth his son zerubbabel to seek
   his fortune in new england in 1661 (for he thought ill of the
   restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman) gave him st ibids 
   or rather brother ibids for he abhorred all that was popish  skull
   as a talisman upon landing in salem zerubbabel set it up in his
   cupboard beside the chimney he having built a modest house near the
   town pump however he had not been wholly unaffected by the
   restoration influence; and having become addicted to gaming lost the
   skull to one epenetus dexter a visiting freeman of providence

   it was in the house of dexter in the northern part of the town near
   the present intersection of north main and olney streets on the
   occasion of canonchets raid of march 30 1676 during king philips
   war; and the astute sachem recognising it at once as a thing of
   singular venerableness and dignity sent it as a symbol of alliance to
   a faction of the pequots in connecticut with whom he was negotiating
   on april 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed
   but the austere head of ibid continued on its wanderings

   the pequots enfeebled by a previous war could give the now stricken
   narragansetts no assistance; and in 1680 a dutch furtrader of albany
   petrus van schaack secured the distinguished cranium for the modest
   sum of two guilders he having recognised its value from the
   halfeffaced inscription carved in lombardic minuscules (palaeography
   it might be explained was one of the leading accomplishments of
   newnetherland furtraders of the seventeenth century)

   from van schaack sad to say the relic was stolen in 1683 by a french
   trader jean grenier whose popish zeal recognised the features of one
   whom he had been taught at his mothers knee to revere as st ibide
   grenier fired with virtuous rage at the possession of this holy symbol
   by a protestant crushed van schaacks head one night with an axe and
   escaped to the north with his booty; soon however being robbed and
   slain by the halfbreed voyageur michel savard who took the skull 
   despite the illiteracy which prevented his recognising it  to add to a
   collection of similar but more recent material

   upon his death in 1701 his halfbreed son pierre traded it among other
   things to some emissaries of the sacs and foxes and it was found
   outside the chiefs tepee a generation later by charles de langlade
   founder of the trading post at green bay wisconsin de langlade
   regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at
   the expense of many glass beads; yet after his time it found itself in
   many other hands being traded to settlements at the head of lake
   winnebago to tribes around lake mendota and finally early in the
   nineteenth century to one solomon juneau a frenchman at the new
   trading post of milwaukee on the menominee river and the shore of lake
   michigan

   later traded to jacques caboche another settler it was in 1850 lost
   in a game of chess or poker to a newcomer named hans zimmerman; being
   used by him as a beerstein until one day under the spell of its
   contents he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie
   path before his home  where falling into the burrow of a prairiedog
   it passed beyond his power of discovery or recovery upon his awaking

   so for generations did the sainted skull of caius anicius magnus furius
   camillus aemilianus cornelius valerius pompeius julius ibidus consul
   of rome favourite of emperors and saint of the romish church lie
   hidden beneath the soil of a growing town at first worshipped with
   dark rites by the prairiedogs who saw in it a deity sent from the
   upper world it afterward fell into dire neglect as the race of simple
   artless burrowers succumbed before the onslaught of the conquering
   aryan sewers came but they passed by it houses went up  2303 of
   them and more  and at last one fateful night a titan thing occurred
   subtle nature convulsed with a spiritual ecstasy like the froth of
   that regions quondam beverage laid low the lofty and heaved high the
   humble  and behold! in the roseal dawn the burghers of milwaukee rose
   to find a former prairie turned to a highland! vast and farreaching
   was the great upheaval subterrene arcana hidden for years came at
   last to the light for there full in the rifted roadway lay bleached
   and tranquil in bland saintly and consular pomp the domelike skull
   of ibid!

   there is nothing more absurd as i view it than that conventional
   association of the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the
   psychology of the multitude mention a bucolic yankee setting a
   bungling and thickfibred village undertaker and a careless mishap in
   a tomb and no average reader can be brought to expect more than a
   hearty albeit grotesque phase of comedy god knows though that the
   prosy tale which george birchs death permits me to tell has in it
   aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light

   birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881 yet never
   discussed the case when he could avoid it neither did his old
   physician dr davis who died years ago it was generally stated that
   the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby birch
   had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of peck valley
   cemetery escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means; but
   while this much was undoubtedly true there were other and blacker
   things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium
   toward the last he confided in me because i was his doctor and
   because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after
   davis died he was a bachelor wholly without relatives

   birch before 1881 had been the village undertaker of peck valley; and
   was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go
   the practices i heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today at
   least in a city; and even peck valley would have shuddered a bit had it
   known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters
   as the ownership of costly layingout apparel invisible beneath the
   caskets lid and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and
   adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not
   always calculated with sublimest accuracy most distinctly birch was
   lax insensitive and professionally undesirable; yet i still think he
   was not an evil man he was merely crass of fibre and function
   thoughtless careless and liquorish as his easily avoidable accident
   proves and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average
   citizen within certain limits fixed by taste

   just where to begin birchs story i can hardly decide since i am no
   practiced teller of tales i suppose one should start in the cold
   december of 1880 when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found
   they could dig no more graves till spring fortunately the village was
   small and the death rate low so that it was possible to give all of
   birchs inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated
   receiving tomb the undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter
   weather and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness never did he
   knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets or disregard more
   flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he
   slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandon

   at last the spring thaw came and graves were laboriously prepared for
   the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb
   birch though dreading the bother of removal and interment began his
   task of transference one disagreeable april morning but ceased before
   noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse after
   having laid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest that was
   darius peck the nonagenarian whose grave was not far from the tomb
   birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old matthew
   fenner whose grave was also near by; but actually postponed the matter
   for three days not getting to work till good friday the 15th being
   without superstition he did not heed the day at all; though ever
   afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth
   day of the week certainly the events of that evening greatly changed
   george birch

   on the afternoon of friday april 15th then birch set out for the
   tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of matthew fenner that
   he was not perfectly sober he subsequently admitted; though he had not
   then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget
   certain things he was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his
   sensitive horse which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed
   and pawed and tossed its head much as on that former occasion when the
   rain had vexed it the day was clear but a high wind had sprung up;
   and birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and
   entered the sidehill vault another might not have relished the damp
   odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins; but birch in
   those days was insensitive and was concerned only in getting the right
   coffin for the right grave he had not forgotten the criticism aroused
   when hannah bixbys relatives wishing to transport her body to the
   cemetery in the city whither they had moved found the casket of judge
   capwell beneath her headstone

   the light was dim but birchs sight was good and he did not get asaph
   sawyers coffin by mistake although it was very similar he had
   indeed made that coffin for matthew fenner; but had cast it aside at
   last as too awkward and flimsy in a fit of curious sentimentality
   aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had
   been to him during his bankruptcy five years before he gave old matt
   the very best his skill could produce but was thrifty enough to save
   the rejected specimen and to use it when asaph sawyer died of a
   malignant fever sawyer was not a lovable man and many stories were
   told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for
   wrongs real or fancied to him birch had felt no compunction in
   assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way
   in his quest for the fenner casket

   it was just as he had recognised old matts coffin that the door
   slammed to in the wind leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before
   the narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays and the overhead
   ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that he was reduced to a
   profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward
   the latch in this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles
   pushed at the iron panels and wondered why the massive portal had
   grown so suddenly recalcitrant in this twilight too he began to
   realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do
   more than neigh an unsympathetic reply for the longneglected latch
   was obviously broken leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the
   vault a victim of his own oversight

   the thing must have happened at about threethirty in the afternoon
   birch being by temperament phlegmatic and practical did not shout
   long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled
   seeing in a corner of the tomb it is doubtful whether he was touched
   at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position but the
   bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough
   to exasperate him thoroughly his days work was sadly interrupted and
   unless chance presently brought some rambler hither he might have to
   remain all night or longer the pile of tools soon reached and a
   hammer and chisel selected birch returned over the coffins to the
   door the air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this
   detail he paid no attention as he toiled half by feeling at the heavy
   and corroded metal of the latch he would have given much for a lantern
   or bit of candle; but lacking these bungled semisightlessly as best
   he might

   when he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding at least to
   such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these birch
   glanced about for other possible points of escape the vault had been
   dug from a hillside so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top
   ran through several feet of earth making this direction utterly
   useless to consider over the door however the high slitlike
   transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a
   diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his
   brains for means to reach it there was nothing like a ladder in the
   tomb and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom
   took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the
   door only the coffins themselves remained as potential
   steppingstones and as he considered these he speculated on the best
   mode of transporting them three coffinheights he reckoned would
   permit him to reach the transom; but he could do better with four the
   boxes were fairly even and could be piled up like blocks; so he began
   to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable
   platform four deep as he planned he could not but wish that the units
   of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made whether he
   had imagination enough to wish they were empty is strongly to be
   doubted

   finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall to
   place upon this two layers of two each and upon these a single box to
   serve as the platform this arrangement could be ascended with a
   minimum of awkwardness and would furnish the desired height better
   still though he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support
   the superstructure leaving one free to be piled on top in case the
   actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude and so the
   prisoner toiled in the twilight heaving the unresponsive remnants of
   mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose
   course by course several of the coffins began to split under the
   stress of handling and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of
   little matthew fenner for the top in order that his feet might have as
   certain a surface as possible in the semigloom he trusted mostly to
   touch to select the right one and indeed came upon it almost by
   accident since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd
   volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third
   layer

   the tower at length finished and his aching arms rested by a pause
   during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device birch
   cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow
   transom the borders of the space were entirely of brick and there
   seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to
   allow his body to pass as his hammer blows began to fall the horse
   outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and to
   others may have been mocking in either case it would have been
   appropriate; for the unexpected tenacity of the easylooking brickwork
   was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes and the
   source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus

   dusk fell and found birch still toiling he worked largely by feeling
   now since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was
   still slow he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the
   top and bottom of the aperture he could he was sure get out by
   midnight though it is characteristic of him that this thought was
   untinged with eerie implications undisturbed by oppressive reflections
   on the time the place and the company beneath his feet he
   philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a
   fragment hit him in the face and laughing when one struck the
   increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree in time
   the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and
   then shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and
   creaked he would not he found have to pile another on his platform
   to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level
   to use as soon as its size might permit

   it must have been midnight at least when birch decided he could get
   through the transom tired and perspiring despite many rests he
   descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather
   strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside the
   hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily and he
   vaguely wished it would stop he was curiously unelated over his
   impending escape and almost dreaded the exertion for his form had the
   indolent stoutness of early middle age as he remounted the splitting
   coffins he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when upon
   reaching the topmost one he heard that aggravated crackle which
   bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood he had it seems planned in
   vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner
   was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way jouncing
   him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine
   maddened by the sound or by the stench which billowed forth even to
   the open air the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for
   a neigh and plunged madly off through the night the wagon rattling
   crazily behind it

   birch in his ghastly situation was now too low for an easy scramble
   out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined
   try clutching the edges of the aperture he sought to pull himself up
   when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on
   both his ankles in another moment he knew fear for the first time that
   night; for struggle as he would he could not shake clear of the
   unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity horrible
   pains as of savage wounds shot through his calves; and in his mind
   was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that
   suggested splinters loose nails or some other attribute of a breaking
   wooden box perhaps he screamed at any rate he kicked and squirmed
   frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost
   eclipsed in a halfswoon

   instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom and in the
   crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground he could not
   walk it appeared and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible
   sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge; his
   fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste and his body
   responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when
   chased by the phantoms of nightmare there was evidently however no
   pursuer; for he was alone and alive when armington the lodgekeeper
   answered his feeble clawing at the door

   armington helped birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his
   little son edwin for dr davis the afflicted man was fully conscious
   but would say nothing of any consequence; merely muttering such things
   as oh my ankles! let go! or shut in the tomb then the doctor
   came with his medicinecase and asked crisp questions and removed the
   patients outer clothing shoes and socks the wounds for both ankles
   were frightfully lacerated about the achilles tendons seemed to
   puzzle the old physician greatly and finally almost to frighten him
   his questioning grew more than medically tense and his hands shook as
   he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get the
   wounds out of sight as quickly as possible

   for an impersonal doctor davis ominous and awestruck
   crossexamination became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from
   the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience
   he was oddly anxious to know if birch were sure absolutely sure of
   the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how he had chosen it how
   he had been certain of it as the fenner coffin in the dusk and how he
   had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious
   asaph sawyer would the firm fenner casket have caved in so readily?
   davis an oldtime village practitioner had of course seen both at the
   respective funerals as indeed he had attended both fenner and sawyer
   in their last illnesses he had even wondered at sawyers funeral how
   the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely
   akin to that of the diminutive fenner

   after a full two hours dr davis left urging birch to insist at all
   times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and
   splintering wood what else he added could ever in any case be proved
   or believed? but it would be well to say as little as could be said
   and to let no other doctor treat the wounds birch heeded this advice
   all the rest of his life till he told me his story; and when i saw the
   scars ancient and whitened as they then were i agreed that he was
   wise in so doing he always remained lame for the great tendons had
   been severed; but i think the greatest lameness was in his soul his
   thinking processes once so phlegmatic and logical had become
   ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to
   certain chance allusions such as friday tomb coffin and words
   of less obvious concatenation his frightened horse had gone home but
   his frightened wits never quite did that he changed his business but
   something always preyed upon him it may have been just fear and it
   may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for
   bygone crudities his drinking of course only aggravated what it was
   meant to alleviate

   when dr davis left birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to
   the old receiving tomb the moon was shining on the scattered brick
   fragments and marred facade and the latch of the great door yielded
   readily to a touch from the outside steeled by old ordeals in
   dissecting rooms the doctor entered and looked about stifling the
   nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced he
   cried aloud once and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible
   than a cry then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of
   his calling by rousing and shaking his patient and hurling at him a
   succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears
   like the hissing of vitriol

   it was asaphs coffin birch just as i thought! i knew his teeth
   with the front ones missing on the upper jaw never for gods sake
   show those wounds! the body was pretty badly gone but if ever i saw
   vindictiveness on any face or former face you know what a fiend he
   was for revenge how he ruined old raymond thirty years after their
   boundary suit and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a
   year ago last august he was the devil incarnate birch and i
   believe his eyeforaneye fury could beat old father death himself
   god what a rage! id hate to have it aimed at me!

   why did you do it birch? he was a scoundrel and i dont blame you
   for giving him a castaside coffin but you always did go too damned
   far! well enough to skimp on the thing some way but you knew what a
   little man old fenner was

   ill never get the picture out of my head as long as i live you
   kicked hard for asaphs coffin was on the floor his head was broken
   in and everything was tumbled about ive seen sights before but
   there was one thing too much here an eye for an eye! great heavens
   birch but you got what you deserved the skull turned my stomach but
   the other was worse those ankles cut neatly off to fit matt fenners
   castaside coffin!

   in the walls of eryx  (1936)
   by h p lovecraft

   published october 1939 in weird tales vol 34 no 4 p 5068

   before i try to rest i will set down these notes in preparation for the
   report i must make what i have found is so singular and so contrary
   to all past experience and expectations that it deserves a very
   careful description

   i reached the main landing on venus march 18 terrestrial time; vi 9
   of the planets calendar being put in the main group under miller i
   received my equipment  watch tuned to venuss slightly quicker
   rotation  and went through the usual mask drill after two days i was
   pronounced fit for duty

   leaving the crystal companys post at terra nova around dawn vi 12 i
   followed the southerly route which anderson had mapped out from the
   air the going was bad for these jungles are always half impassable
   after a rain it must be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and
   creepers that leathery toughness; a toughness so great that a knife has
   to work ten minutes on some of them by noon it was dryer  the
   vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that my knife went through it
   easily  but even then i could not make much speed these carter oxygen
   masks are too heavy  just carrying one half wears an ordinary man out
   a dubois mask with spongereservoir instead of tubes would give just as
   good air at half the weight

   the crystaldetector seemed to function well pointing steadily in a
   direction verifying andersons report it is curious how that principle
   of affinity works  without any of the fakery of the old divining
   rods back home there must be a great deposit of crystals within a
   thousand miles though i suppose those damnable manlizards always
   watch and guard it possibly they think we are just as foolish for
   coming to venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for grovelling
   in the mud whenever they see a piece of it or for keeping that great
   mass on a pedestal in their temple i wish theyd get a new religion
   for they have no use for the crystals except to pray to barring
   theology they would let us take all we want  and even if they learned
   to tap them for power thered be more than enough for their planet and
   the earth besides i for one am tired of passing up the main deposits
   and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle riverbeds sometime
   ill urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff army
   from home about twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn
   the trick one cant call the damned things men for all their cities
   and towers they havent any skill except building  and using swords
   and poison darts  and i dont believe their socalled cities mean
   much more than anthills or beaverdams i doubt if they even have a
   real language  all the talk about psychological communication through
   those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk what misleads
   people is their upright posture; just an accidental physical
   resemblance to terrestrial man

   id like to go through a venus jungle for once without having to watch
   out for skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts they may
   have been all right before we began to take the crystals but theyre
   certainly a bad enough nuisance now  with their dartshooting and
   their cutting of our water pipes more and more i come to believe that
   they have a special sense like our crystaldetectors no one ever knew
   them to bother a man  apart from longdistance sniping  who didnt
   have crystals on him

   around 1 pm a dart nearly took my helmet off and i thought for a
   second one of my oxygen tubes was punctured the sly devils hadnt made
   a sound but three of them were closing in on me i got them all by
   sweeping in a circle with my flame pistol for even though their colour
   blended with the jungle i could spot the moving creepers one of them
   was fully eight feet tall with a snout like a tapirs the other two
   were average sevenfooters all that makes them hold their own is sheer
   numbers  even a single regiment of flame throwers could raise hell
   with them it is curious though how theyve come to be dominant on
   the planet not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans
   and skorahs or the flying tukahs of the other continent  unless of
   course those holes in the dionaean plateau hide something

   about two oclock my detector veered westward indicating isolated
   crystals ahead on the right this checked up with anderson and i
   turned my course accordingly it was harder going  not only because
   the ground was rising but because the animal life and carnivorous
   plants were thicker i was always slashing ugrats and stepping on
   skorahs and my leather suit was all speckled from the bursting darohs
   which struck it from all sides the sunlight was all the worse because
   of the mist and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least every
   time i stepped my feet sank down five or six inches and there was a
   sucking sort of blup every time i pulled them out i wish somebody
   would invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this
   climate cloth of course would rot; but some thin metallic tissue that
   couldnt tear  like the surface of this revolving decayproof record
   scroll  ought to be feasible sometime

   i ate about 3:30  if slipping these wretched food tablets through my
   mask can be called eating soon after that i noticed a decided change
   in the landscape  the bright poisonouslooking flowers shifting in
   colour and getting wraithlike the outlines of everything shimmered
   rhythmically and bright points of light appeared and danced in the
   same slow steady tempo after that the temperature seemed to fluctuate
   in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drumming

   the whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep regular pulsations
   that filled every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind
   alike i lost all sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily nor did
   it change things in the least when i shut my eyes and covered my ears
   with my hands however my mind was still clear and in a very few
   minutes i realized what had happened

   i had encountered at last one of those curious mirageplants about
   which so many of our men told stories anderson had warned me of them
   and described their appearance very closely  the shaggy stalk the
   spiky leaves and the mottled blossoms whose gaseous dreambreeding
   exhalations penetrate every existing make of mask

   recalling what happened to bailey three years ago i fell into a
   momentary panic and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy
   chaotic world which the plants exhalations had woven around me then
   good sense came back and i realized all i need do was retreat from the
   dangerous blossoms  heading away from the source of the pulsations
   and cutting a path blindly  regardless of what might seem to swirl
   around me  until safely out of the plants effective radius

   although everything was spinning perilously i tried to start in the
   right direction and hack my way ahead my route must have been far from
   straight for it seemed hours before i was free of the mirageplants
   pervasive influence gradually the dancing lights began to disappear
   and the shimmering spectral scenery began to assume the aspect of
   solidity when i did get wholly clear i looked at my watch and was
   astonished to find that the time was only 4:20 though eternities had
   seemed to pass the whole experience could have consumed little more
   than a halfhour

   every delay however was irksome and i had lost ground in my retreat
   from the plant i now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by
   the crystaldetector bending every energy toward making better time
   the jungle was still thick though there was less animal life once a
   carnivorous blossom engulfed my right foot and held it so tightly that
   i had to hack it free with my knife; reducing the flower to strips
   before it let go

   in less than an hour i saw that the jungle growths were thinning out
   and by five oclock  after passing through a belt of treeferns with
   very little underbrush  i emerged on a broad mossy plateau my
   progress now became rapid and i saw by the wavering of my
   detectorneedle that i was getting relatively close to the crystal i
   sought this was odd for most of the scattered egglike spheroids
   occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this
   treeless upland

   the terrain sloped upward ending in a definite crest i reached the
   top about 5:30 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests
   in the distance this without question was the plateau mapped by
   matsugawa from the air fifty years ago and called on our maps eryx
   or the erycinian highland but what made my heart leap was a smaller
   detail whose position could not have been far from the plains exact
   centre it was a single point of light blazing through the mist and
   seeming to draw a piercing concentrated luminescence from the
   yellowish vapourdulled sunbeams this without doubt was the crystal
   i sought  a thing possibly no larger than a hens egg yet containing
   enough power to keep a city warm for a year i could hardly wonder as
   i glimpsed the distant glow that those miserable manlizards worship
   such crystals and yet they have not the least notion of the powers
   they contain

   breaking into a rapid run i tried to reach the unexpected prize as
   soon as possible; and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a
   thin singularly detestable mud studded with occasional patches of
   weeds and creepers but i splashed on heedlessly  scarcely thinking to
   look around for any of the skulking manlizards in this open space i
   was not very likely to be waylaid as i advanced the light ahead
   seemed to grow in size and brilliancy and i began to notice some
   peculiarity in its situation clearly this was a crystal of the very
   finest quality and my elation grew with every spattering step

   it is now that i must begin to be careful in making my report since
   what i shall henceforward have to say involves unprecedented  though
   fortunately verifiable  matters i was racing ahead with mounting
   eagerness and had come within a hundred yards or so of the crystal 
   whose position on a sort of raised place in the omnipresent slime
   seemed very odd  when a sudden overpowering force struck my chest and
   the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward into the
   mud the splash of my fall was terrific nor did the softness of the
   ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head
   from a bewildering jarring for a moment i lay supine too utterly
   startled to think then i half mechanically stumbled to my feet and
   began to scrape the worst of the mud and scum from my leather suit

   of what i had encountered i could not form the faintest idea i had
   seen nothing which could have caused the shock and i saw nothing now
   had i after all merely slipped in the mud? my sore knuckles and
   aching chest forbade me to think so or was this whole incident an
   illusion brought on by some hidden mirageplant? it hardly seemed
   probable since i had none of the usual symptoms and since there was
   no place near by where so vivid and typical a growth could lurk unseen
   had i been on the earth i would have suspected a barrier of nforce
   laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone but in this
   humanless region such a notion would have been absurd

   finally pulling myself together i decided to investigate in a cautious
   way holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me so that it might
   be first to feel the strange force i started once more for the shining
   crystal  preparing to advance step by step with the greatest
   deliberation at the third step i was brought up short by the impact of
   the knife  point on an apparently solid surface  a solid surface
   where my eyes saw nothing

   after a moments recoil i gained boldness extending my gloved left
   hands i verified the presence of invisible solid matter  or a tactile
   illusion of solid matter  ahead of me upon moving my hand i found
   that the barrier was of substantial extent and of an almost glassy
   smoothness with no evidence of the joining of separate blocks nerving
   myself for further experiments i removed a glove and tested the thing
   with my bare hand it was indeed hard and glassy and of a curious
   coldness as contrasted with the air around i strained my eyesight to
   the utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing
   substance but could discern nothing whatsoever there was not even any
   evidence of refractive power as judged by the aspect of the landscape
   ahead absence of reflective power was proved by the lack of a glowing
   image of the sun at any point

   burning curiosity began to displace all other feelings and i enlarged
   my investigations as best i could exploring with my hands i found
   that the barrier extended from the ground to some level higher than i
   could reach and that it stretched off indefinitely on both sides it
   was then a wall of some kind  though all guesses as to its materials
   and its purpose were beyond me again i thought of the mirageplant and
   the dreams it induced but a moments reasoning put this out of my
   head

   knocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife and kicking
   at it with my heavy boots i tried to interpret the sounds thus made
   there was something suggestive of cement or concrete in these
   reverberations though my hands had found the surface more glassy or
   metallic in feel certainly i was confronting something strange beyond
   all previous experience

   the next logical move was to get some idea of the walls dimensions
   the height problem would be hard if not insoluble but the length and
   shape problem could perhaps be sooner dealt with stretching out my
   arms and pressing close to the barrier i began to edge gradually to
   the left  keeping very careful track of the way i faced after several
   steps i concluded that the wall was not straight but that i was
   following part of some vast circle or ellipse and then my attention
   was distracted by something wholly different  something connected with
   the stilldistant crystal which had formed the object of my quest

   i have said that even from a great distance the shining objects
   position seemed indefinably queer  on a slight mound rising from the
   slime now  at about a hundred yards  i could see plainly despite the
   engulfing mist just what that mound was it was the body of a man in
   one of the crystal companys leather suits lying on his back and with
   his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few inches away in his right
   hand crushed convulsively against his chest was the crystal which had
   led me here  a spheroid of incredible size so large that the dead
   fingers could scarcely close over it even at the given distance i
   could see that the body was a recent one there was little visible
   decay and i reflected that in this climate such a thing meant death
   not more than a day before soon the hateful farnothflies would begin
   to cluster about the corpse i wondered who the man was surely no one
   i had seen on this trip it must have been one of the oldtimers absent
   on a long roving commission who had come to this especial region
   independently of andersons survey there he lay past all trouble and
   with the rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his
   stiffened fingers

   for fully five minutes i stood there staring in bewilderment and
   apprehension a curious dread assailed me and i had an unreasonable
   impulse to run away it could not have been done by those slinking
   manlizards for he still held the crystal he had found was there any
   connexion with the invisible wall? where had he found the crystal?
   andersons instrument had indicated one in this quarter well before
   this man could have perished i now began to regard the unseen barrier
   as something sinister and recoiled from it with a shudder yet i knew
   i must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of
   this recent tragedy

   suddenly  wrenching my mind back to the problem i faced  i thought of
   a possible means of testing the walls height or at least of finding
   whether or not it extended indefinitely upward seizing a handful of
   mud i let it drain until it gained some coherence and then flung it
   high in the air toward the utterly transparent barrier at a height of
   perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible surface with a resounding
   splash disintegrating at once and oozing downward in disappearing
   streams with surprising rapidity plainly the wall was a lofty one a
   second handful hurled at an even sharper angle hit the surface about
   eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the first

   i now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful
   as high as i possibly could letting the mud drain and squeezing it to
   maximum dryness i flung it up so steeply that i feared it might not
   reach the obstructing surface at all it did however and this time it
   crossed the barrier and fell in the mud beyond with a violent
   spattering at last i had a rough idea of the height of the wall for
   the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or twentyone feet
   aloft

   with a nineteen  or twentyfoot vertical wall of glassy flatness
   ascent was clearly impossible i must then continue to circle the
   barrier in the hope of finding a gate an ending or some sort of
   interruption did the obstacle form a complete round or other closed
   figure or was it merely an arc or semicircle? acting on my decision
   i resumed my slow leftward circling moving my hands up and down over
   the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or other small
   aperture before starting i tried to mark my position by kicking a
   hole in the mud but found the slime too thin to hold any impression i
   did though gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in
   the distant forest which seemed just on a line with the gleaming
   crystal a hundred yards away if no gate or break existed i could now
   tell when i had completely circumnavigated the wall

   i had not progressed far before i decided that the curvature indicated
   a circular enclosure of about a hundred yards diameter  provided the
   outline was regular this would mean that the dead man lay near the
   wall at a point almost opposite the region where i had started was he
   just inside or just outside the enclosure? this i would soon ascertain

   as i slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate window or
   other break i decided that the body was lying within on closer view
   the features of the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing i found
   something alarming in his expression and in the way the glassy eyes
   stared by the time i was very near i believed i recognized him as
   dwight a veteran whom i had never known but who was pointed out to me
   at the post last year the crystal he clutched was certainly a prize 
   the largest single specimen i had ever seen

   i was so near the body that i could  but for the barrier  have
   touched it when my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the
   unseen surface in a second i had learned that there was an opening
   about three feet wide extending from the ground to a height greater
   than i could reach there was no door nor any evidence of hingemarks
   bespeaking a former door without a moments hesitation i stepped
   through and advanced two paces to the prostrate body  which lay at
   right angles to the hallway i had entered in what seemed to be an
   intersecting doorless corridor it gave me a fresh curiosity to find
   that the interior of this vast enclosure was divided by partitions

   bending to examine the corpse i discovered that it bore no wounds
   this scarcely surprised me since the continued presence of the crystal
   argued against the pseudoreptilian natives looking about for some
   possible cause of death my eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close
   to the bodys feet here indeed was something significant without
   this device no human being could breathe the air of venus for more than
   thirty seconds and dwight  if it were he  had obviously lost his
   probably it had been carelessly buckled so that the weight of the
   tubes worked the straps loose  a thing which could not happen with a
   dubois spongereservoir mask the halfminute of grace had been too
   short to allow the man to stoop and recover his protection  or else
   the cyanogen content of the atmosphere was abnormally high at the time
   probably he had been busy admiring the crystal  wherever he may have
   found it he had apparently just taken it from the pouch in his suit
   for the flap was unbuttoned

   i now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead
   prospectors fingers  a task which the bodys stiffness made very
   difficult the spheroid was larger than a mans fist and glowed as if
   alive in the reddish rays of the weltering sun as i touched the
   gleaming surface i shuddered involuntarily  as if by taking this
   precious object i had transferred to myself the doom which had
   overtaken its earlier bearer however my qualms soon passed and i
   carefully buttoned the crystal into the pouch of my leather suit
   superstition has never been one of my failings

   placing the mans helmet over his dead staring face i straightened up
   and stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the
   great enclosure all my curiosity about the strange edifice now
   returned and i racked my brains with speculations regarding its
   material origin and purpose that the hands of men had reared it i
   could not for a moment believe our ships first reached venus only
   seventytwo years ago and the only human beings on the planet have
   been those at terra nova nor does human knowledge include any
   perfectly transparent nonrefractive solid such as the substance of
   this building prehistoric human invasions of venus can be pretty well
   ruled out so that one must turn to the idea of native construction
   did a forgotten race of highlyevolved beings precede the manlizards
   as masters of venus? despite their elaboratelybuilt cities it seemed
   hard to credit the pseudoreptiles with anything of this kind there
   must have been another race aeons ago of which this is perhaps the
   last relique or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by future
   expeditions? the purpose of such a structure passes all conjecture 
   but its strange and seemingly nonpractical material suggests a
   religious use

   realizing my inability to solve these problems i decided that all i
   could do was to explore the invisible structure itself that various
   rooms and corridors extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud i
   felt convinced; and i believed that a knowledge of their plan might
   lead to something significant so feeling my way back through the
   doorway and edging past the body i began to advance along the corridor
   toward those interior regions whence the dead man had presumably come
   later on i would investigate the hallway i had left

   groping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight i moved slowly
   onward soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward
   the centre in everdiminishing curves now and then my touch would
   reveal a doorless intersecting passage and i several times encountered
   junctions with two three and four diverging avenues in these latter
   cases i always followed the inmost route which seemed to form a
   continuation of the one i had been traversing there would be plenty of
   time to examine the branches after i had reached and returned from the
   main regions i can scarcely describe the strangeness of the experience
    threading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by
   forgotten hands on an alien planet!

   at last still stumbling and groping i felt the corridor end in a
   sizeable open space fumbling about i found i was in a circular
   chamber about ten feet across; and from the position of the dead man
   against certain distant forest landmarks i judged that this chamber lay
   at or near the centre of the edifice out of it opened five corridors
   besides the one through which i had entered but i kept the latter in
   mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on
   the horizon as i stood just within the entrance

   there was nothing in this room to distinguish it  merely the floor of
   thin mud which was everywhere present wondering whether this part of
   the building had any roof i repeated my experiment with an
   upwardflung handful of mud and found at once that no covering
   existed if there had ever been one it must have fallen long ago for
   not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet as i
   reflected it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently
   primordial structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry gaps in
   the walls and other common attributes of dilapidation

   what was it? what had it ever been? of what was it made? why was there
   no evidence of separate blocks in the glassy bafflingly homogenous
   walls? why were there no traces of doors either interior or exterior?
   i knew only that i was in a round roofless doorless edifice of some
   hard smooth perfectly transparent nonrefractive and nonreflective
   material a hundred yards in diameter with many corridors and with a
   small circular room at the centre more than this i could never learn
   from a direct investigation

   i now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the west  a
   goldenruddy disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the
   mistclouded trees of the horizon plainly i would have to hurry if i
   expected to choose a sleepingspot on dry ground before dark i had
   long before decided to camp for the night on the firm mossy rim of the
   plateau near the crest whence i had first spied the shining crystal
   trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the manlizards
   it has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of
   two or more so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours but
   the really small number of night attacks makes the company careless
   about such things those scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in
   seeing at night even with curious glow torches

   having picked out again the hallway through which i had come i started
   to return to the structures entrance additional exploration could
   wait for another day groping a course as best i could through the
   spiral corridors  with only general sense memory and a vague
   recognition of some of the illdefined weed patches on the plain as
   guides  i soon found myself once more in close proximity to the
   corpse there were now one or two farnoth flies swooping over the
   helmetcovered face and i knew that decay was setting in with a
   futile instinctive loathing i raised my hand to brush away his vanguard
   of the scavengers  when a strange and astonishing thing became
   manifest an invisible wall checking the sweep of my arm told me that
    notwithstanding my careful retracing of the way  i had not indeed
   returned to the corridor in which the body lay instead i was in a
   parallel hallway having no doubt taken some wrong turn or fork among
   the intricate passages behind

   hoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead i continued my
   advance but presently came to a blank wall i would then have to
   return to the central chamber and steer my course anew exactly where i
   had made my mistake i could not tell i glanced at the ground to see if
   by any miracle guiding footprints had remained but at once realized
   that the thin mud held impressions only for a very few moments there
   was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre again and once
   there i carefully reflected on the proper outward course i had kept
   too far to the right before this time i must take a more leftward fork
   somewhere  just where i could decide as i went

   as i groped ahead a second time i felt quite confident of my
   correctness and diverged to the left at a junction i was sure i
   remembered the spiralling continued and i was careful not to stray
   into any intersecting passages soon however i saw to my disgust that
   i was passing the body at a considerable distance; this passage
   evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it in the hope
   that another exit might exist in the half of the wall i had not yet
   explored i pressed forward for several paces but eventually came once
   more to a solid barrier clearly the plan of the building was even
   more complicated than i had thought

   i now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try
   some of the lateral corridors extending toward the body if i chose
   this second alternative i would run the risk of breaking my mental
   pattern of where i was; hence i had better not attempt it unless i
   could think of some way of leaving a visible trail behind me just how
   to leave a trail would be quite a problem and i ransacked my mind for
   a solution there seemed to be nothing about my person which could
   leave a mark on anything nor any material which i could scatter  or
   minutely subdivide and scatter

   my pen had no effect on the invisible wall and i could not lay a trail
   of my precious food tablets even had i been willing to spare the
   latter there would not have been even nearly enough  besides which
   the small pellets would have instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud
   i searched my pockets for an oldfashioned notebook  often used
   unofficially on venus despite the quick rottingrate of paper in the
   planets atmosphere  whose pages i could tear up and scatter but
   could find none it was obviously impossible to tear the tough thin
   metal of this revolving decayproof record scroll nor did my clothing
   offer any possibilities in venuss peculiar atmosphere i could not
   safely spare my stout leather suit and underwear had been eliminated
   because of the climate

   i tried to smear mud on the smooth invisible walls after squeezing it
   as dry as possible but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as
   did the heighttesting handfuls i had previously thrown finally i drew
   out my knife and attempted to scratch a line on the glassy phantom
   surface  something i could recognize with my hand even though i would
   not have the advantage of seeing it from afar it was useless however
   for the blade made not the slightest impression on the baffling
   unknown material

   frustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail i again sought the round
   central chamber through memory it seemed easier to act back to this
   room than to steer a definite predetermined course away from it and i
   had little difficulty in finding it anew this time i listed on my
   record scroll every turn i made  drawing a crude hypothetical diagram
   of my route and marking all diverging corridors it was of course
   maddeningly slow work when everything had to be determined by touch
   and the possibilities of error were infinite; but i believed it would
   pay in the long run

   the long twilight of venus was thick when i reached the central room
   but i still had hopes of gaining the outside before dark comparing my
   fresh diagram with previous recollections i believed i had located my
   original mistake so once more set out confidently along the invisible
   hallways i veered further to the left than during my previous
   attempts and tried to keep track of my turnings on the records scroll
   in case i was still mistaken in the gathering dusk i could see the dim
   line of the corpse now the centre of a loathsome cloud of
   farnothflies before long no doubt the muddwelling sificlighs would
   be oozing in from the plain to complete the ghastly work approaching
   the body with some reluctance i was preparing to step past it when a
   sudden collision with a wall told me i was again astray

   i now realized plainly that i was lost the complications of this
   building were too much for offhand solution and i would probably have
   to do some careful checking before i could hope to emerge still i was
   eager to get to dry ground before total darkness set in; hence i
   returned once more to the centre and began a rather aimless series of
   trials and errors  making notes by the light of my electric lamp when
   i used this device i noticed with interest that it produced no
   reflection  not even the faintest glistening  in the transparent
   walls around me i was however prepared for this; since the sun had
   at no time formed a gleaming image in the strange material

   i was still groping about when the dusk became total a heavy mist
   obscured most of the stars and planets but the earth was plainly
   visible as a glowing bluishgreen point in the southeast it was just
   past opposition and would have been a glorious sight in a telescope i
   could even make out the moon beside it whenever the vapours momentarily
   thinned it was now impossible to see the corpse  my only landmark 
   so i blundered back to the central chamber after a few false turns
   after all i would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry ground
   nothing could be done till daylight and i might as well make the best
   of it here lying down in the mud would not be pleasant but in my
   leather suit it could be done on former expeditions i had slept under
   even worse conditions and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer
   repugnance

   so here i am squatting in the slime of the central room and making
   these notes on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp
   there is something almost humorous in my strange unprecedented plight
   lost in a building without doors  a building which i cannot see! i
   shall doubtless get out early in the morning and ought to be back at
   terra nova with the crystal by late afternoon it certainly is a beauty
    with surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp i have
   just had it out examining it despite my fatigue sleep is slow in
   coming so i find myself writing at great length i must stop now not
   much danger of being bothered by those cursed natives in this place
   the thing i like least is the corpse  but fortunately my oxygen mask
   saves me from the worst effects i am using the chlorate cubes very
   sparingly will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in more
   later

   later  afternoon vi 13

   there has been more trouble than i expected i am still in the
   building and will have to work quickly and wisely if i expect to rest
   on dry ground tonight it took me a long time to get to sleep and i
   did not wake till almost noon today as it was i would have slept
   longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze the corpse was a
   rather bad sight  wriggling with sificlighs and with a cloud of
   farnothflies around it something had pushed the helmet away from the
   face and it was better not to look at it i was doubly glad of my
   oxygen mask when i thought of the situation

   at length i shook and brushed myself dry took a couple of food
   tablets and put a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of
   the mask i am using these cubes slowly but wish i had a larger
   supply i felt much better after my sleep and expected to get out of
   the building very shortly

   consulting the notes and sketches i had jotted down i was impressed by
   the complexity of the hallways and by the possibility that i had made
   a fundamental error of the six openings leading out of the central
   space i had chosen a certain one as that by which i had entered 
   using a sightingarrangement as a guide when i stood just within the
   opening the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in line with a
   particular lepidodendron in the faroff forest now it occurred to me
   that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracy  the
   distance of the corpse making its difference of direction in relation
   to the horizon comparatively slight when viewed from the openings next
   to that of my first ingress moreover the tree did not differ as
   distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the horizon

   putting the matter to a test i found to my chagrin that i could not be
   sure which of three openings was the right one had i traversed a
   different set of windings at each attempted exit? this time i would be
   sure it struck me that despite the impossibility of trailblazing
   there was one marker i could leave though i could not spare my suit i
   could  because of my thick head of hair  spare my helmet; and this
   was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud
   accordingly i removed the roughly hemispherical device and laid it at
   the entrance of one of the corridors  the righthand one of the three
   i must try

   i would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct;
   repeating what i seemed to recall as the proper turns and constantly
   consulting and making notes if i did not get out i would
   systematically exhaust all possible variations; and if these failed i
   would proceed to cover the avenues extending from the next opening in
   the same way  continuing to the third opening if necessary sooner or
   later i could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit but i must
   use patience even at worst i could scarcely fail to reach the open
   plain in time for a dry nights sleep

   immediate results were rather discouraging though they helped me
   eliminate the righthand opening in little more than an hour only a
   succession of blind alleys each ending at a great distance from the
   corpse seemed to branch from this hallway; and i saw very soon that it
   had not figured at all in the previous afternoons wanderings as
   before however i always found it relatively easy to grope back to the
   central chamber

   about 1 pm i shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began
   to explore the hallways beyond it at first i thought i recognized the
   turnings but soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of
   corridors i could not get near the corpse and this time seemed cut
   off from the central chamber as well even though i thought i had
   recorded every move i made there seemed to be tricky twists and
   crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams and i
   began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement while
   patience would of course win in the end i saw that my searching would
   have to be minute tireless and longcontinued

   two oclock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridors 
   constantly feeling my way looking alternately at my helmet and at the
   corpse and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence i
   cursed the stupidity and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this
   tangle of unseen walls  reflecting that if i had let the thing alone
   and headed back as soon as i had taken the crystal from the body i
   would even now be safe at terra nova

   suddenly it occurred to me that i might be able to tunnel under the
   invisible walls with my knife and thus effect a short cut to the
   outside  or to some outwardleading corridor i had no means of
   knowing how deep the buildings foundations were but the omnipresent
   mud argued the absence of any floor save the earth facing the distant
   and increasingly horrible corpse i began a course of feverish digging
   with the broad sharp blade

   there was about six inches of semiliquid mud below which the density
   of the soil increased sharply this lower soil seemed to be of a
   different colour  a greyish clay rather like the formations near
   venuss north pole as i continued downward close to the unseen barrier
   i saw that the ground was getting harder and harder watery mud rushed
   into the excavation as fast as i removed the clay but i reached
   through it and kept on working if i could bore any kind of a passage
   beneath the wall the mud would not stop my wriggling out

   about three feet down however the hardness of the soil halted my
   digging seriously its tenacity was beyond anything i had encountered
   before even on this planet and was linked with an anomalous
   heaviness my knife had to split and chip the tightly packed clay and
   the fragments i brought up were like solid stones or bits of metal
   finally even this splitting and chipping became impossible and i had
   to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reach

   the hourlong attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one for it used
   up great stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food
   tablet and to put an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask it
   has also brought a pause in the days gropings for i am still much too
   exhausted to walk after cleaning my hands and arms of the worst of the
   mud i sat down to write these notes  leaning against an invisible wall
   and facing away from the corpse

   that body is simply a writhing mass of vermin now  the odour has begun
   to draw some of the slimy akmans from the faroff jungle i notice that
   many of the efjehweeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous
   feelers toward the thing; but i doubt if any are long enough to reach
   it i wish some really carnivorous organisms like the skorahs would
   appear for then they might scent me and wriggle a course through the
   building toward me things like that have an odd sense of direction i
   could watch them as they came and jot down their approximate route if
   they failed to form a continuous line even that would be a great help
   when i met any the pistol would make short work of them

   but i can hardly hope for as much as that now that these notes are
   made i shall rest a while longer and later will do some more groping
   as soon as i get back to the central chamber  which ought to be fairly
   easy  i shall try the extreme lefthand opening perhaps i can get
   outside by dusk after all

   night  vi 13

   new trouble my escape will be tremendously difficult for there are
   elements i had not suspected another night here in the mud and a
   fight on my hands tomorrow i cut my rest short and was up and groping
   again by four oclock after about fifteen minutes i reached the
   central chamber and moved my helmet to mark the last of the three
   possible doorways starting through this opening i seemed to find the
   going more familiar but was brought up short less than five minutes by
   a sight that jolted me more than i can describe

   it was a group of four or five of those detestable manlizards emerging
   from the forest far off across the plain i could not see them
   distinctly at that distance but thought they paused and turned toward
   the trees to gesticulate after which they were joined by fully a dozen
   more the augmented party now began to advance directly toward the
   invisible building and as they approached i studied them carefully i
   had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy
   shadows of the jungle

   the resemblance to reptiles was perceptible though i knew it was only
   an apparent one since these beings have no point of contact with
   terrestrial life when they drew nearer they seemed less truly
   reptilian  only the flat head and the green slimy froglike skin
   carrying out the idea they walked erect on their odd thick stumps
   and their suctiondiscs made curious noises in the mud these were
   average specimens about seven feet in height and with four long ropy
   pectoral tentacles the motions of those tentacles  if the theories of
   fogg ekberg and janat are right which i formerly doubted but am now
   more ready to believe  indicate that the things were in animated
   conversation

   i drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight the odds were
   bad but the weapon gave me a certain advantage if the things knew
   this building they would come through it after me and in this way
   would form a key to getting out; just as carnivorous skorahs might have
   done that they would attack me seemed certain; for even though they
   could not see the crystal in my pouch they could divine its presence
   through that special sense of theirs

   yet surprisingly enough they did not attack me instead they
   scattered and formed a vast circle around me  at a distance which
   indicated that they were pressing close to the unseen wall standing
   there in a ring the beings stared silently and inquisitively at me
   waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding their heads and gesturing
   with their upper limbs after a while i saw others issue from the
   forest and these advanced and joined the curious crowd those near the
   corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it it was a
   horrible sight yet the manlizards seemed quite unconcerned now and
   then one of them would brush away the farnothflies with its limbs or
   tentacles or crush a wriggling sificligh or akman or an outreaching
   efjehweed with the suction discs on its stumps

   staring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders and wondering
   uneasily why they did not attack me at once i lost for the time being
   the willpower and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out
   instead i leaned limply against the invisible wall of the passage where
   i stood letting my wonder merge gradually into a chain of the wildest
   speculations a hundred mysteries which had previously baffled me
   seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister significance and i
   trembled with an acute fear unlike anything i had experienced before

   i believed i knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly
   around me i believed too that i had the secret of the transparent
   structure at last the alluring crystal which i had seized the body of
   the man who had seized it before me  all these things began to acquire
   a dark and threatening meaning

   it was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in
   this roofless unseen tangle of corridors far from it beyond doubt
   the place was a genuine maze  a labyrinth deliberately built by these
   hellish things whose craft and mentality i had so badly underestimated
   might i not have suspected this before knowing of their uncanny
   architectural skill? the purpose was all too plain it was a trap  a
   trap set to catch human beings and with the crystal spheroid as bait
   these reptilian things in their war on the takers of crystals had
   turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against us

   dwight  if this rotting corpse were indeed he  was a victim he must
   have been trapped some time ago and had failed to find his way out
   lack of water had doubtless maddened him and perhaps he had run out of
   chlorate cubes as well probably his mask had not slipped accidentally
   after all suicide was a likelier thing rather than face a lingering
   death he had solved the issue by removing the mask deliberately and
   letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once the horrible irony
   of his fate lay in his position  only a few feet from the saving exit
   he had failed to find one minute more of searching and he would have
   been safe

   and now i was trapped as he had been trapped and with this circling
   herd of curious starers to mock at my predicament the thought was
   maddening and as it sank in i was seized with a sudden flash of panic
   which set me running aimlessly through the unseen hallways for several
   moments i was essentially a maniac  stumbling tripping bruising
   myself on the invisible walls and finally collapsing in the mud as a
   panting lacerated heap of mindless bleeding flesh

   the fall sobered me a bit so that when i slowly struggled to my feet i
   could notice things and exercise my reason the circling watchers were
   swaying their tentacles in an odd irregular way suggestive of sly
   alien laughter and i shook my fist savagely at them as i rose my
   gesture seemed to increase their hideous mirth  a few of them clumsily
   imitating it with their greenish upper limbs shamed into sense i
   tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situation

   after all i was not as badly off as dwight has been unlike him i
   knew what the situation was  and forewarned is forearmed i had proof
   that the exit was attainable in the end and would not repeat his
   tragic act of impatient despair the body  or skeleton as it would
   soon be  was constantly before me as a guide to the sought  for
   aperture and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if i worked
   long and intelligently enough

   i had however the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian
   devils now that i realized the nature of the trap  whose invisible
   material argued a science and technology beyond anything on earth  i
   could no longer discount the mentality and resources of my enemies
   even with my flamepistol i would have a bad time getting away  though
   boldness and quickness would doubtless see me through in the long run

   but first i must reach the exterior  unless i could lure or provoke
   some of the creatures to advance toward me as i prepared my pistol for
   action and counted over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to
   me to try the effect of its blasts on the invisible walls had i
   overlooked a feasible means of escape? there was no clue to the
   chemical composition of the transparent barrier and conceivably it
   might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese
   choosing a section facing the corpse i carefully discharged the pistol
   at close range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed
   nothing was changed i had seen the flame spread when it struck the
   surface and now i realized that my hope had been vain only a long
   tedious search for the exit would ever bring me to the outside

   so swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the
   elecrolyser of my mask i recommenced the long quest; retracing my
   steps to the central chamber and starting out anew i constantly
   consulted my notes and sketches and made fresh ones  taking one false
   turn after another but staggering on in desperation till the afternoon
   light grew very dim as i persisted in my quest i looked from time to
   time at the silent circle of mocking stares and noticed a gradual
   replacement in their ranks every now and then a few would return to
   the forest while others would arrive to take their places the more i
   thought of their tactics the less i liked them for they gave me a hint
   of the creatures possible motives at any time these devils could have
   advanced and fought me but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles
   to escape i could not but infer that they enjoyed the spectacle  and
   this made me shrink with double force from the prospect of falling into
   their hands

   with the dark i ceased my searching and sat down in the mud to rest
   now i am writing in the light of my lamp and will soon try to get some
   sleep i hope tomorrow will see me out; for my canteen is low and
   lacol tablets are a poor substitute for water i would hardly dare to
   try the moisture in this slime for none of the water in the
   mudregions is potable except when distilled that is why we run such
   long pipe lines to the yellow clay regions  or depend on rainwater
   when those devils find and cut our pipes i have none too many chlorate
   cubes either and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as
   i can my tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon and my later panic
   flight burned up a perilous amount of air tomorrow i will reduce
   physical exertion to the barest minimum until i meet the reptiles and
   have to deal with them i must have a good cube supply for the journey
   back to terra nova my enemies are still on hand; i can see a circle of
   their feeble glowtorches around me there is a horror about those
   lights which will keep me awake

   night  vi 14

   another full day of searching and still no way out! i am beginning to
   be worried about the water problem for my canteen went dry at noon in
   the afternoon there was a burst of rain and i went back to the central
   chamber for the helmet which i had left as a marker  using this as a
   bowl and getting about two cupfuls of water i drank most of it but
   have put the slight remainder in my canteen lacol tablets make little
   headway against real thirst and i hope there will be more rain in the
   night i am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls food
   tablets are none too plentiful but not dangerously low i shall halve
   my rations from now on the chlorate cubes are my real worry for even
   without violent exercise the days endless tramping burned a dangerous
   number i feel weak from my forced economies in oxygen and from my
   constantly mounting thirst when i reduce my food i suppose i shall
   feel still weaker

   there is something damnable  something uncanny  about this labyrinth
   i could swear that i had eliminated certain turns through charting and
   yet each new trial belies some assumption i had thought established
   never before did i realize how lost we are without visual landmarks a
   blind man might do better  but for most of us sight is the king of the
   senses the effect of all these fruitless wanderings is one of profound
   discouragement i can understand how poor dwight must have felt his
   corpse is now just a skeleton and the sificlighs and akmans and
   farnothflies are gone the efjenweeds are nipping the leather
   clothing to pieces for they were longer and fastergrowing than i had
   expected and all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand
   gloatingly around the barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery
   another day and i shall go mad if i do not drop dead from exhaustion

   however there is nothing to do but persevere dwight would have got
   out if he had kept on a minute longer it is just possible that
   somebody from terra nova will come looking for me before long although
   this is only my third day out my muscles ache horribly and i cant
   seem to rest at all lying down in this loathesome mud last night
   despite my terrific fatigue i slept only fitfully and tonight i fear
   will be no better i live in an endless nightmare  poised between
   waking and sleeping yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep my hand
   shakes i can write no more for the time being that circle of feeble
   glowtorches is hideous

   late afternoon  vi 15

   substantial progress! looks good very weak and did not sleep much
   till daylight then i dozed till noon though without being at all
   rested no rain and thirst leaves me very weak ate an extra food
   tablet to keep me going but without water it didnt help much i dared
   to try a little of the slime water just once but it made me violently
   sick and left me even thirstier than before must save chlorate cubes
   so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen cant walk much of the
   time but manage to crawl in the mud about 2 pm i thought i
   recognized some passages and got substantially nearer to the corpse 
   or skeleton  than i had been since the first days trials i was
   sidetracked once in a blind alley but recovered the main trail with
   the aid of my chart and notes the trouble with these jottings is that
   there are so many of them they must cover three feet of the record
   scroll and i have to stop for long periods to untangle them

   my head is weak from thirst suffocation and exhaustion and i cannot
   understand all i have set down those damnable green things keep
   staring and laughing with their tentacles and sometimes they
   gesticulate in a way that makes me think they share some terrible joke
   just beyond my perception

   it was three oclock when i really struck my stride there was a
   doorway which according to my notes i had not traversed before; and
   when i tried it i found i could crawl circuitously toward the
   weedtwined skeleton the route was a sort of spiral much like that by
   which i had first reached the central chamber whenever i came to a
   lateral doorway or junction i would keep to the course which seemed
   best to repeat that original journey as i circled nearer and nearer to
   my gruesome landmark the watchers outside intensified their cryptic
   gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter evidently they saw
   something grimly amusing in my progress  perceiving no doubt how
   helpless i would be in any encounter with them i was content to leave
   them to their mirth; for although i realized my extreme weakness i
   counted on the flame pistol and its numerous extra magazines to get me
   through the vile reptilian phalanx

   hope now soared high but i did not attempt to rise to my feet better
   crawl now and save my strength for the coming encounter with the
   manlizards my advance was very slow and the danger of straying into
   some blind alley very great but nonetheless i seemed to curve steadily
   toward my osseous goal the prospect gave me new strength and for the
   nonce i ceased to worry about my pain my thirst and my scant supply
   of cubes the creatures were now all massing around the entrance 
   gesturing leaping and laughing with their tentacles soon i
   reflected i would have to face the entire horde  and perhaps such
   reinforcements as they would receive from the forest

   i am now only a few yards from the skeleton and am pausing to make
   this entry before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of
   entities i feel confident that with my last ounce of strength i can
   put them to flight despite their numbers for the range of this pistol
   is tremendous then a camp on the dry moss at the plateaus edge and
   in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to terra nova i shall
   be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings again the
   teeth of that skull gleam and grin horribly

   toward night  vi i 5

   horror and despair baffled again! after making the previous entry i
   approached still closer to the skeleton but suddenly encountered an
   intervening wall i had been deceived once more and was apparently
   back where i had been three days before on my first futile attempt to
   leave the labyrinth whether i screamed aloud i do not know  perhaps i
   was too weak to utter a sound i merely lay dazed in the mud for a long
   period while the greenish things outside leaped and laughed and
   gestured

   after a time i became more fully conscious my thirst and weakness and
   suffocation were fast gaining on me and with my last bit of strength i
   put a new cube in the electrolyser  recklessly and without regard for
   the needs of my journey to terra nova the fresh oxygen revived me
   slightly and enabled me to look about more alertly

   it seemed as if i were slightly more distant from poor dwight than i
   had been at that first disappointment and i dully wondered if i could
   be in some other corridor a trifle more remote with this faint shadow
   of hope i laboriously dragged myself forward  but after a few feet
   encountered a dead end as i had on the former occasion

   this then was the end three days had taken me nowhere and my
   strength was gone i would soon go mad from thirst and i could no
   longer count on cubes enough to get me back i feebly wondered why the
   nightmare things had gathered so thickly around the entrance as they
   mocked me probably this was part of the mockery  to make me think i
   was approaching an egress which they knew did not exist

   i shall not last long though i am resolved not to hasten matters as
   dwight did his grinning skull has just turned toward me shifted by
   the groping of one of the efjehweeds that are devouring his leather
   suit the ghoulish stare of those empty eyesockets is worse than the
   staring of those lizard horrors it lends a hideous meaning to that
   dead whitetoothed grin

   i shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength i can this
   record  which i hope may reach and warn those who come after me  will
   soon be done after i stop writing i shall rest a long while then
   when it is too dark for those frightful creatures to see i shall
   muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the record
   scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside
   i shall take care to send it toward the left where it will not hit the
   leaping band of mocking beleaguers perhaps it will be lost forever in
   the thin mud  but perhaps it will land in some widespread clump of
   weeds and ultimately reach the hands of men

   if it does survive to be read i hope it may do more than merely warn
   men of this trap i hope it may teach our race to let those shining
   crystals stay where they are they belong to venus alone our planet
   does not truly need them and i believe we have violated some obscure
   and mysterious law  some law buried deep in the arcane of the cosmos 
   in our attempts to take them who can tell what dark potent and
   widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who guard their
   treasure so strangely? dwight and i have paid as others have paid and
   will pay but it may be that these scattered deaths are only the
   prelude of greater horrors to come let us leave to venus that which
   belongs only to venus

   i am very near death now and fear i may not be able to throw the
   scroll when dusk comes if i cannot i suppose the manlizards will
   seize it for they will probably realize what it is they will not wish
   anyone to be warned of the labyrinth  and they will not know that my
   message holds a plea in their own behalf as the end approaches i feel
   more kindly towards the things in the scale of cosmic entity who can
   say which species stands higher or more nearly approaches a
   spacewide organic norm  theirs or mine?

   i have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my
   last moments it shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the
   dying day the leaping horde have noticed it and their gestures have
   changed in a way i cannot understand i wonder why they keep clustered
   around the entrance instead of concentrating at a still closer point in
   the transparent wall

   i am growing numb and cannot write much more things whirl around me
   yet i do not lose consciousness can i throw this over the wall? that
   crystal glows so yet the twilight is deepening

   dark very weak they are still laughing and leaping around the
   doorway and have started those hellish glowtorches

   are they going away? i dreamed i heard a sound light in the sky

   report of wesley p miller supt group a venus crystal co

   (terra nova on venus  vl 16)

   our operative a49 kenton j stanfield of 5317 marshall street
   richmond va left terra nova early on vi 12 for a shortterm trip
   indicated by detector due back 13th or 14th did not appear by evening
   of 15th so scouting plane fr58 with five men under my command set out
   at 8 pm to follow route with detector needle showed no change from
   earlier readings

   followed needle to erycinian highland played strong searchlights all
   the way triplerange flameguns and dradiation cylinders could have
   dispersed any ordinary hostile force of natives or any dangerous
   aggregation of carnivorous skorahs

   when over the open plain on eryx we saw a group of moving lights which
   we knew were native glowtorches as we approached they scattered into
   the forest probably seventyfive to a hundred in all detector
   indicated crystal on spot where they had been sailing low over this
   spot our lights picked out objects on the ground skeleton tangled in
   efjehweeds and complete body ten feet from it brought plane down
   near bodies and corner of wing crashed on unseen obstruction

   approaching bodies on foot we came up short against a smooth
   invisible barrier which puzzled us enormously feeling along it near
   the skeleton we struck an opening beyond which was a space with
   another opening leading to the skeleton the latter though robbed of
   clothing by weeds had one of the companys numbered metal helmets
   beside it it was operative b9 frederick n dwight of koenigs
   division who had been out of terra nova for two months on a long
   commission

   between this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another
   wall but we could easily identify the second man as stanfield he had
   a record scroll in his left hand and a pen in his right and seemed to
   have been writing when he died no crystal was visible but the
   detector indicated a huge specimen near stanfields body

   we had great difficulty in getting at stanfield but finally succeeded
   the body was still warm and a great crystal lay beside it covered by
   the shallow mud we at once studied the record scroll in the left hand
   and prepared to take certain steps based on its data the contents of
   the scroll forms the long narrative prefixed to this report; a
   narrative whose main descriptions we have verified and which we append
   as an explanation of what was found the later parts of this account
   show mental decay but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it
   stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst suffocation
   cardiac strain and psychological depression his mask was in place
   and freely generating oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supply

   our plane being damaged we sent a wireless and called out anderson
   with repair plane pg7 a crew of wreckers and a set of blasting
   materials by morning fh58 was fixed and went back under anderson
   carrying the two bodies and the crystal we shall bury dwight and
   stanfield in the company graveyard and ship the crystal to chicago on
   the next earthbound liner later we shall adopt stanfields
   suggestion  the sound one in the saner earlier part of his report 
   and bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether with
   a clear field there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal
   we can secure

   in the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great
   care exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords and preparing a
   complete chart for our archives we were much impressed by the design
   and shall keep specimens of the substance for chemical analysis all
   such knowledge will be useful when we take over the various cities of
   the natives our type c diamond drills were able to bite into the
   unseen material and wreckers are now planting dynamite preparatory to
   a thorough blasting nothing will be left when we are done the edifice
   forms a distinct menace to aerial and other possible traffic

   in considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with
   the irony of dwights fate but with that of stanfield as well when
   trying to reach the second body from the skeleton we could find no
   access on the right but markheim found a doorway from the first inner
   space some fifteen feet past dwight and four or five past stanfield
   beyond this was a long hall which we did not explore till later but on
   the righthand side of that hall was another doorway leading directly
   to the body stanfield could have reached the outside entrance by
   walking twentytwo or twentythree feet if he had found the opening
   which lay directly behind him  an opening which he overlooked in his
   exhaustion and despair

             respectfully dedicated to rheinhart kiciner esq
                       with compliments of the author

   how sad droop the willows by zalals fair side
   where so lately i strayd with my ravenhaird bride;
   evry lightfloating lily each flowr on the shore
   folds in sorrow since laeta can see them no more!
   oh blest were the days when in childhood and hope
   with my laeta i rovd oer the blossomclad slope
   plucking white meadowdaisies and ferns by the stream
   as we laughd at the ripples that twinkle and gleam
   not a bloom deckd the mead that could rival in grace
   the dear innocent charms of my laetas fair face;
   not a thrush thrilld the grove with a carol so choice
   as the silvery strains of my laetas sweet voice
   the shy nymphs of the woodlands the fount and the plain
   strove to equal her beauty but strove all in vain;
   yet no envy they bore her while fruitless they strove
   for so pure was my laeta they could only love!
   when the warm breath of auster playd soft oer the flowrs
   and young zephyrus rustled the gay scented bowrs
   evry breeze seemd to pause as it drew near the fair
   too much awd at her sweetness to tumble her hair
   how fond were our dreams on the day when we stood
   in the ivygrown temple beside the dark wood;
   when our pledges we seald at the sanctifyd shrine
   and i knew that my laeta forever was mine!
   how blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came
   and the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame;
   yet how heavy my heart when i first felt the fear
   that my starryeyed laeta would fade with the year!
   the pastures were sere and the heavens were grey
   when i laid my lovd laeta forever away
   and the river god pityd as weeping i pacd
   mingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste
   now the flowrs have returnd but they bloom not so sweet
   as in days when they blossomd round laetas dear feet;
   and the willows complain to the answering hill
   and the thrushes that once were so happy are still
   the green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine
   whilst the dryads no more in their madrigals join
   the breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs
   and blows soft oer the spot where my lovd laeta lies
   so pensive i roam oer the desolate lawn
   where we wanderd and lovd in the days that are gone
   and i yearn for the autumn when zalals blue tide
   shall sing low by my grave and the lovd laetas side

   lovecraft1924

   ps a new pictorial artist will work wonders for wt there is a
   special technique to weird drawing  a sort of sinister mocking
   approach to conventional design + a subtle grotesquerie + distortion
   the best example i know of is shsime who illustrates the standard
   editions of dunsanys books:
   598 angell st providence ri

   february 2 1924

   my dear mr henneberger:

   i was very glad to hear from you and to receive so many sidelights on
   weird tales whose chosen field makes me very eager for its success i
   know the financial end of magazine publishing must be a tremendous and
   often discouraging responsibility and i have a sincere respect for the
   pluck and determination of anybody who undertakes such a venture most
   certainly do i hope that some favourable turn will gradually transform
   your burdensome debt on the two magazines into an increasingly
   gratifying profitand it seems to me that many facts warrant such
   optimism for in the weird field you are practically alone and with a
   good start whilst in the detective field there sees to be an
   insatiable demand for new material still i know that marketing is a
   venturesome and uncertain processespecially with dealers in the
   unscrupulous state of mind you describe!

   i assure you that i was not at all disconcerted by the presence of the
   transparent ghost beside my hound in the first place i dont take
   myself too seriously; and in the second place i can appreciate the
   sort of humour involved in such touches of comic relieflike the
   gravedigger in hamlet or the porter in macbeth when a magazine
   covers a popular clientele and appeals to one particular interest it
   is peculiarly apt to elicit literaryor more or
   lessliterarycontributions from its readers; so that i suppose a very
   large proportion of those who have seen weird tales have flooded the
   office with unacceptable manuscripts to them the whole subject of
   impossible contributions has become a live issue so that the
   exploitation of some comically illiterate attempt carries a piquancy
   which they can feel and smile at even though others may find it
   somewhat tedious and inapropos the transparent ghost may not be an
   austerely literary asset yet i cannot doubt but that it will make many
   friends for the magazine and perhaps assuage more than one subtle
   sting left behind by rejected mss

   i hope anyway that this matter wont be instrumental in deposing mr
   baird from the editorship until he is himself ready to relinquish it;
   for i feel that he must have done very well on the whole considering
   the adverse conditions encountered in the quest for really weird
   stories that he could get hold of as many as five perfectly
   satisfactory yarns is an almost remarkable phenomenon in view of the
   lack of truly artistic and individual expression among professional
   fictionwriters when i see a magazine tending toward the commonplace
   the last people i blame are the editors and publishers; for even a
   cursory survey of the professional writing field shows that the trouble
   is something infinitely deeper and widersomething concerning no one
   publication but the whole atmosphere and temperament of the american
   fiction business and even when i get to such large units as this i
   cant be any too savage about the blamingbecause i realise that much
   of the trouble is absolutely inevitableas incapable of human remedy
   as the fate of any protagonist in the greek drama here in america we
   have a very conventional and halfeducated publica public trained
   under one phase or another of the puritan tradition and almost dulled
   to aesthetic sensitiveness because of the monotonous and omnipresent
   overstressing of the ethical element we have millions who lack the
   intellectual independence courage and flexibility to get an artistic
   thrill out of a bizarre situation and who enter sympathetically into a
   story only when it ignores the colour and vividness of actual human
   emotions and conventionally presents a simple plot based on artificial
   ethically sugarcoated values and leading to a flat denouement which
   shall vindicate every current platitude and leave no mystery
   unexplained by the shallow comprehension of the most mediocre reader
   that is the kind of a public publishers confront and only a fool or a
   rejectionvenomed author could blame the publishers for a condition
   caused not by them but by the whole essence and historic tradition of
   our civilisation if publishers of general magazines sought and used
   artistically original types of fiction they would lose their readers
   almost to a man half of the people wouldnt understand what the tales
   were about and the other half would find the characters
   unsympatheticbecause they would think and act like real people
   instead of like the dummies which the american middle classes have been
   taught and persuaded to consider and accept as people such i repeat
   is the inevitable condition regarding general fiction; the enormous
   bulk of fiction which sets the national standard and determines the
   type of technical training given all fictional students but even this
   is not all! added to this as if by the perversity of a malign fate is
   the demand of an overspeeding public for excessive quantity production
   baldly put the american people demand more stories per year than the
   really artistic authors of america could possibly write a real artist
   never works fast and never turns out large quantities he cant
   contract to deliver so many words in such and such a time but must
   work slowly gradually and by mood; utilising favourable states of
   mind and refraining from putting down the stuff his brain turns out
   when it is tired of disinclined to such work how this of course
   wont do when there are hundreds of magazines to fill at regular
   intervals so many pages per month or week have got to be filled and
   if the artistic writers cant do it the publishers must find the
   nextbest thingpersons of mere talent who can learn certain
   mechanical rules and technical twists and put forth stuff of external
   smoothness whose sole merit is conforming to patterns and rehashing
   the situations and reactions which have been found interesting to the
   people by previous experience in many cases these writers achieve
   popularitybecause the public recognise the elements that pleased them
   before and are satisfied to receive them again in transposed fora
   actually the typical reader has very little true taste; and judges by
   absurd freaks sentimentalities and analogies so it has come to be an
   accepted tradition that american fiction is not an art but a tradea
   thing to be learnt by rule by almost anybody and demanding above all
   else a complete submergence of ones own personality and thought in the
   general stream of conventional patterns which correspond to the bleakly
   uniform view of life forced on us by mediocre leadership success
   therefore comes not to the man of genius but to the clever fellow who
   knowshow to catch the public point of view and play up to it
   glittering tinsel reputations are built up and dumb driven hundreds of
   otherwise honest plumbers take correspondence courses and try to be
   like these scintillant great ones whose achievements are really no
   more than mere charlatanry such is our fictional
   situationindiscriminate hordes of writers mostly without genius
   striving by erroneous methods toward a goal which is erroneous to start
   with! you see the thing at its zenith in papers like the saturday
   evening postwhere men of more or less real talent are weighted down
   with the freelyflung gold which forms the price of their originality
   and artistic conscience a fearful incubuswhich only a few adroit or
   daring souls ever shake off

   now weird fiction even in america is not subject to the limitations
   of general fiction when a person the sort of person forming the
   readers of macabre fictionwants an outre narrative at all he is
   willing and anxious to take something removed from the beaten track of
   the national tradition; the tradition of conventional insipidity here
   is our real exceptionthe man who wants something originalbut in the
   face of a general tradition which usurps all the education of our
   storytellers we can only ask in tragic accents who is going to give
   it to him? popular custom dins it into every young author that he must
   conform to patterns and reflect a smug artificial world and psychology
   how can he beat this game of loaded dice in the one matter of the
   weird which as a minority branch can hardly be expected to develop a
   school all its own in defiance of general fictional custom? ive yet to
   see the person who can answer that question ive tried to take in hand
   a bright young chap in this towna fellow with a conventional start
   but who is now anxious to succeed with the weird time and again i
   alter his work deleting commonplace situations images and reactions
   and introducing touches which he never thought of but which i consider
   dramatically effective in that kind of work time and again i do this
   yet with the most discouraging results i succeed for a timethen in
   some knotty tangle his old training asserts itself and he surmounts a
   situation in the stereotyped unimaginative popular way and all the
   time i am trying to help him i have a curiously contrary sensation of
   guilt in that i may be spoiling him for salable work in the nonweird
   field by shaking his faith in flashy conventions!

   so when i read weird tales and note here and there a story full of
   hackneyed stuffthe laboratory the clubroom with wellgroomed men
   around the fire the beautiful queen of remote planets the ghost that
   is a human villain trying to scare somebody out of a house  etc
   etc  i never think of blaming mr baird; for out of a somewhat wide
   knowledge of noneminent writers gained through various club
   affiliations i am perfectly well aware that he had to take the stuff
   because no man living could get enough of anything else to fill the
   required number of pages at the required intervals i don t believe
   there is enough firstrate weird fiction written in america to fill a
   monthly magazine the size of weird talesand it could be developed
   only by catching the author young and making it possible for him to
   abstain from doing conventional fiction the best youll ever get is
   from men of liberal culture who do that sort of thing as an
   avocationfor the sheer thrill of it and not with a professional
   frame of mind i should say paul suter is likethator burton peter
   thom or seabury quinn or m humphreys or anthony m rud (though hes
   had a book published) or sevaral others i dont recall plainly by
   name these people have all been represented by excellent work and i
   believe it would almost be better to have more than one take by each in
   a single issue than to use less vivid material merely for the sake of
   nonrepeating on the same table of contents beyond the door was a
   finely effective pieceas were the floor above ooze and the
   phantom farmhouse another thing i noted some of the best ideasthe
   ideas which showed the most original power and understanding of the
   essence of the terrible and grotesquewere handled by obvious novices
   or at least writers with no command of technique or sense of literary
   balance im quite enthusiastic about the leaving shadows byholmes
   in your very first issue that thing is bungling and halting so far as
   form goesbut ill be hanged if it hasnt got a thrill which no
   commonplace person however highly trained could ever duplicate the
   open window by frank owen (january) is not dissimilar as a case of
   firstrate idea and thirdrate development; though here the poignancy
   of the idea and the crudeness of the narration are both less marked i
   honestly believe that one way to get good weird material is to tell the
   editor to sharpen his scent for the genuinely bizarre irrespective of
   technique accept any powerful plot or atmospheric triumph irrespective
   of technique or even literacypaying half the usual market price and
   telling the author whyand the have the raw material completely
   rewritten by some staff writer of competent training who could add
   his name as collaborator or not according to the amount of work he
   puts into it in this way i am confident you could get many better
   things than you could by excluding all mss below a certain technical
   standard it isnt always the college man or even the reasonably
   proficient writer who has the mental slant that makes vivid ideas of
   course there would hardly be an abundance of these notable but
   inadequate mss yet i think there would be enough to warrant their
   acceptance and rewriting i know ive many a time doctored up
   something for another fellow which seemed very crude at first but
   whenhafter completion made me wish i were its full author but at best
   its hard work getting convincing horror material among even the most
   eminent the true touch of sublime and delirious fear is deucedly hard
   to find arthur machen is the only living masterin the full sense of
   the word i could possibly name in this field  a point which i think
   anyone can appreciate by comparing his episode of the white powder in
   the three impostors with every other tale of terror known to this
   generation i think though that with the requisite capital a
   magazine could train tip a group of effective weird writers by offering
   them a free and lucrative field and letting some expert give them
   recommendations as to readingwhat authors to avoid and what ones to
   emulate i know a kida junior at columbia named prank b long
   jrwho could give you some creepy stuff if he could be persuaded to
   write out half the ideas he has im inducing him to send in a
   poeman old wife speaketh itto weird tales and if he receives
   encouragement he may furnish more there must be more like himif one
   has the time to look them up a youth in your own cityalfred galpin
   jr now holding a postgraduate fellowship at the university of
   chicagowrote something at sixteen which would chill any average
   blood; but circumstanceand the general scholastic genius which is
   going to make an eminent professor of him some daysidetracked this
   phase of his genius

   what you say about writing up and amplifying real horrors and ghastly
   tragedies is interesting and probably sensible from the standpoint of
   popular interest it ought to attract readers because of its appeal to
   the strings of memorynearly everyone will have heard each theme
   mentioned in associated press items hence will feel an added sense of
   shuddering reality yet from the art standpointfrom the standpoint of
   effective evocation of nameless ecstacies of keenedged and titillating
   reari dont think anything can equal good weird fiction there is
   only a passing horror in sordid sanguinary gruesomenessin bloody axe
   murders and sadistic morbidities what really moves the profoundest
   springs of human fear and unholy fascination is something which
   suggests black infinite vistas of cryptic brooding halfinscrutable
   monstrosities for ever lurking behind nature and as capable of being
   manifested again as in the case treated the supreme principle of this
   sort of horror is any suggestion of the major violation of some basic
   law of naturethe breaking down of the line betwixt life and death
   man and the other animals etcor the annihilation of the principle
   of time and space bringing vastly remote age or localities into
   juxtaposition a true artist in the terrible can always invent ideas
   and plots a thousandfold more effective than any real tragedy or fright
   which ever darkened the earth gilding thenor ebonising themwith a
   subtlety of atmosphere which is after all the most potent single factor
   in any imaginative tale come to think of it i guess atmosphere and
   colour mean more any day than idea or plotthis being the reason we
   have so few effective phantasies in these days when plot and action are
   played up at the expense of the more leisurely attributes of writing
   of course atmosphere is the one thing which a skilful developer can
   give a reallife tragedy he can colour it to his hearts content and
   inject suspicions of more than mortal motives and agencies which bring
   it close to the effective fictional state i certainly think your idea
   is worth trying though as a lover of fictional art for its own sake i
   should hate to see the monthly quota of stories descend to the minimum
   record of two or three exclusive of the novel i dont think i really
   enjoy anything so much as a really good weird story i would give a
   thousand dollars not to have read poes house of usher or ligeia
   just for the thrill of following them breathlessly with pristine
   suspense over what was coming i have never seen a copy of the
   terrific register and must confess to a perfect ignorance of what it
   is if you can connect me with a copy at my expense i shall consider
   myself ever afterward your debtor by the way thtoughjust before i
   forget itlet me say that i think the weakest thing about the present
   weird tales is the prevalence of news fillers some of which have a
   very remote connection with actual weirdness bald news certainly needs
   a skilful retouching before it assorts well with the fictional
   atmosphere id suggest that the new policy of using poetry is very
   good  and dont think i say this because ur baird has just accepted
   some verse from me i wish you could use more verse by my california
   friend clark ashton smith who has perpetrated some terrific flights
   such as the hashisheater; or the apocalypse of evil smith also
   draws splendidly and with more encouragement than he received from
   houtain could turn out some sketches much better than his
   illustrations to my lurking pear but all this is mere random
   suggestion made whilst i think of it

   i am interested in the idea you originally formed from my stuff in home
   brewespecially interested because i consider that stuff among my
   poorest ordinarily i refuse altogether to write to order or to give
   my tales any mechanical limitations to suit other people but houtain
   is a personal friend of minehed have to be to get me to read his
   ribald ragand when he started home brew he was desperately anxious to
   get me to give him some of my stuff i offered him his pick of all my
   mss but they didnt look quite flashy and lowbrow enough to suit him;
   so he began to entreat that i prepare him a series of six tales each
   of 2000 words and complete in itself which should go the limit for
   sensational morbidity i might add that my taste does not run
   especially to the morbid as such that i love is the unreal and the
   fantastic in every form; though of course only such of my work as is
   terrible could ever please a popular audience finally i agreed for
   friendships sake to give houtain what he wanted running over a list
   pf possible plots until he took a fancy to the notion of a
   graverobbing physician who restored life to bodies and was finally
   snatched himself by the bodies he had resuscitated together with
   certain nameless companions of theirs this i developed into the series
   herbert westreanimator and i can assure you i was sick of the job
   before i was half done the necessity for the completeness of each
   instalment spoiled the artistry of the whole thinginvolving as it did
   the wearisome recapitulation of former matter in each instalment and
   the eternal repetition of the description of dr herbert west and his
   unamiable pursuits when i had that out of the way i vowed i would
   never again write a tale to order; and succumbed in the case of the
   lurking pear only because houtain permitted me to forego the series
   form and make it a regular serial the prospect of smiths
   illustrations was another baitthough in the end they proved much
   below his usual pictorial halting average but the lurking pear never
   satisfied me because i unwisely tried to follow houtains wish for
   perfectly equal instalmentsirrespective of dramatic valuesand for a
   smashing subclimax at the end of each instalment the result of all
   this was a certain artificiality and straining and a redundancy of
   incident in many of the instalments i still feel that i have
   halfwasted a good plot idea and often believe i would like to rewrite
   the thing for my own artistic satisfaction and let some magazine
   publish the new version free after securing the necessary permission
   from houtain! i dont think it ought to be a serial at allits short
   enough to be complete without a break or chapterdivision especially
   with the redundant matter cut out but it taught me one thingnever to
   try to suit the other fellow or let my original instincts of form get
   overridden! now im fully resolved to let all my work stay unpublished
   unless somebody will print it without a comma or semicolon changed! the
   oldfashioned touch in my work is the result of my natural temperament
   and reading i grew up with a large family library in a big house and
   browsed at random because i was too ill to attend school or even follow
   a tutors course with any regularity somehow i acquired a fondness for
   the past as compared with the presenta fondness which had plenty of
   chance to reign because my semiinvalidism continued and kept me from
   college and business despite the most extravagant ambitions of boyhood
   frothing modern had any permanent power to fascinate meand until my
   weird tales venture my only acquaintance with modern magazines was a
   spell of allstory and argosy reading ten or fifteen years ago
   undertaken for the purpose of capturing the occasional weird yarns in
   these periodicalsespecially the former the classics were my diet
   and i have never found anything else half so good! my style of course
   is fundamentally and immutably antiquecomplacently antique i might
   addand most of my tastes correspond a new interest which has grown
   as my health has grown during the past three years is that of colonial
   architecturethe visual recreation of the 18th century by study of
   its surviving landmarksand most of my newborn strength has been
   utilised in the exploration of the antique towns which abound in my
   native newengland so really i dont think you could have paid me a
   handsomer unconscious compliment than when you suspected my lurking
   pear of being a rewritten antique i hope you didnt think it was
   very extensively rewritten! only a charge of verbatim plagiarism from
   an 18th century master could have pleased me more!

   i shall watch the modified future of weird tales with keen interest
   looking with especial avidity for your own work since you so
   emphatically share my aversion for the insipid rubberstamp popular
   magazine atmosphere the acquisition of houdini ought to be a great
   selling asset for his fame and ability in his spectacular line are
   vast and indisputable i am not much of a vaudeville follower but it
   happens that i saw him at the old keiths theatre here nearly a quarter
   of a century ago it must have been at the very outset of his career
   for he was not then especially well known since then it interested me
   to hear that he comes from appleton wisconsin the home town of my
   learned young friend alfred galpin whom i mentioned earlier in this
   epistle i did not know that he writes or that he possessed such a
   notable library as you describe certainly it will afford me
   unmeasured delight to meet this library and its versatile ownera
   thing the more probable because although not much given to long trips
   it is very likely that i shall live in new york after the coming
   spring i suppose his articles naturally would have the imperfect
   background you mention because he has been mainly accustomed to
   expressing his personality in different ways i can tell better after
   seeing the one in the march issue perhaps houdini furnishes an
   instance of the condition i mentioned beforethe creator of genius who
   needs a rewriter to give his recorded work the form which may
   perfectly express its spirit

   your compliment anent the rats in the walls delights me mightilythe
   more so because robert h davis of the munsey firm rejected it after
   some deliberation as too horrible for his readers  another
   illustration of the essential insipidity and conventionality inculcated
   into our writing public by some of its leaders when the manuscript was
   read among the circle of my friends in hew york arthur leedsthe man
   who conducts the thinks and things department in the writers
   monthlywas gratifyingly enthusiastic about it but declared pretty
   dogmatically i am told that no american magazine would ever accept
   it such are the tacitly acknowledged and submissively accepted
   conventions of the timid majority!

   i feel flattered that you should wish to see a long manuscript of
   mine25000 words or moreand will probably have something of the
   sort to show you in the near future formerly i wrote only short
   stories believing that this was the ideal form for weird fiction; but
   perusal of certain weird novels gradually changed my point of view
   until after my houtain experiments in greater length i began to map out
   certain of my more involved ideas as possible novels i keep plot ideas
   and skeletonic synopses recorded in a blankbookthe sort one would
   call a commonplacebook if the term did not carry a certain irony as
   applied to the contents of this particular one! jfy main novel idea is
   that of a long phantasy to be called (subject to change) azathoth
   dealing with bizarre scenes somewhat in the exotic spirit of the
   arabian fights i dont know when i shall tackle the actual writing of
   this but im sure you wouldnt care for it for weird tales since it
   will be horrible only in parts and contain also much prosepoetic
   matter and descriptions of cities and landscapes which are marvellous
   and weird but not gruesome or terrible it will belong to the category
   of vathek or some of dunsanys longer more ethereal and less
   sophisticated things in the horrible parts though i dont intend to
   be in the least insipid or commonplace! the scene will probably be in a
   distant planet and there may be no human characters in the accepted
   sense of the word other things than humans you know may go through
   very vivid adventures and embark on very picturesque quests but i
   think i shall send you unless it pans out too long a second tale
   which is about ready for the actual composition this (also
   provisionally) will be known as the house of the worm and deal with
   the frantic message sent by a dying and prematurely aged father to the
   boy who ran away twenty years before because of a nameless dread of his
   new stepmother  the heiress who lived in the dark house in the
   swamp the young man comes and finds his father alone in the house (or
   castleim not sure whether ill put it in hew england or old england
   or the german black forest)  alone yet not alone  for he looks
   furtively about him  and other forms flit through remote corridors
   strangely attracting swarms of flies after them  and vultures hover
   over the whole swamp  and the young man sees things when he goes out
   on one occasion  but i neednt say more you can see what sort of a
   yarn it is and i shall certainly send it when it is done; unless as i
   say it comes to an odd and peculiarly unacceptable length perhaps
   ill send it anyway

   but i see that ive rattled this letter out to unconscionable
   lengthsfor which i trust youll duly forgive me i hope my various
   remarks may have buried in them some grains of sense which will answer
   for intelligent suggestions though as a practical planner i never was
   very notable i certainly wish you the very best of luck with weird
   tales and hope every modification may develop in the right direction;
   though i realise very fully all the difficulties besetting any
   experiment of the sort is it ethical and possible to get in touch with
   writers in other magazines? in thinking over my old allstory reading
   and newer specimens brought to my attention i recall several people
   who did very fair workand one case of actual excellence this last is
   a writer signing himself a merritt who some five years ago had a
   novelette in the allstory called the moon pool the power of dark
   and titanic suggestion in this unexplained mystery was enormous; and i
   was not surprised when the thing came out in book form with two errors
   of astronomical nature removed later merritt had two more things in
   the allstory both inferior and showing the devitalising pressure of
   the cheap popularmagazine ideal given a free hand i feel that this
   writer could snap back into his old mood and beat any other weird
   author in the current magazine field; and i wish there were a way of
   getting in touch with him another man with promise is philip m
   pisher jr who had a fine thing in a recent allstory spoiled only
   by a tame ending obviously designed to suit the gentle bob davis told
   to let the human race go to hell pisher could accomplish wonders his
   tale was called fungus island then there were some oldtimers whom i
   recall only dimly victor rousseau was an allstory star of the first
   magnitude who wrote at least one noxiously powerful thing called the
   seademons street and smith in 1919 published a magazine called the
   thrill book which although i unfortunately never saw it is spoken of
   very highly by those who did see it some of its writers must be useful
   hands to have around weird tales and i think they would be worth
   looking up unless my informant greatly exaggerated this some
   informant by the way is quite certain that the best story in the
   november weird tales is pilfered word for word from a story in that
   magazinethe crawling death by pa connolly i think he wrote mr
   baird about it and he is still uncertain whether it was an outandout
   steal or a case ofthe same writer selling his work twice on the
   chance that the thrill book was too shortlived to be remembered

   but i certainly have rambled enough! i shall be very glad to see the
   cheque when it comes though well knowing that my own straits are
   shared more or less by everybody else all along the line! i hope the
   difficulty of payment doesnt deter any firstrate writers from
   contributing  i suggested to mr baird that it might have exactly
   theopposite effect scaring off the mercenaries and leaving those
   artistic writers who draw horror for horrors sake!
   with all good wishes and appreciations believe me

   most sincerely yours

   12043letter to clark ashton smith november 27 1927h p lovecraft

   i have had no chance to produce new material this autumn but have been
   classifying notes & synopses in preparation for some monstrous tales
   later on in particular i have drawn up some data on the celebrated &
   unmentionable necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred! it seems
   that this shocking blasphemy was produced by a native of sanaá in
   yemen who flourished about 700 ad & made many mysterious pilgrimages
   to babylons ruins memphiss catacombs & the devilhaunted &
   untrodden wastes of the great southern deserts of arabia  the roba el
   khaliyeh where he claimed to have found records of things older than
   mankind & to have learnt the worship of yogsothoth & cthulhu the
   book was a product of abduls old age which was spent in damascus &
   the original title was al azif  azif (cf henleys notes to vathek)
   being the name applied to those strange night noises (of insects) which
   the arabs attribute to the howling of daemons alhazred died  or
   disappeared  under terrible circumstances in the year 738 in 950 al
   azif was translated into greek by the byzantine theodorus philetas
   under the title necronomicon & a century later it was burnt at the
   order of michael patriarch of constantinople it was translated into
   latin by olaus in 1228 but placed on the index expurgatorius by pope
   gregory ix in 1232 the original arabic was lost before olaus time &
   the last known greek copy perished in salem in 1692 the work was
   printed in the 15th 16th & 17th centuries but few copies are extant
   wherever existing it is carefully guarded for the sake of the worlds
   welfare & sanity once a man read through the copy in the library of
   miskatonic university at arkham  read it through & fled wildeyed
   into the hills but that is another story!

   9570letter to the gallomo december 11 1919h p lovecraft

   before quitting the subject of loveman and horror stories i must
   relate the frightful dream i had the night after i received sls
   latest letter we have lately been discussing weird tales at length
   and he has recommended several hairraising books to me; so that i was
   in the mood to connect him with any thought of hideousness or
   supernatural terror i do not recall how this dream began or what it
   was really all about there remains in my mind only one damnably
   bloodcurdling fragment whose ending haunts me yet we were for some
   terrible yet unknown reason in a very strange and very ancient
   cemetery  which i could not identify i suppose no wisconsinite can
   picture such a thing  but we have them in new england; horrible old
   places where the slate stones are graven with odd letters and grotesque
   designs such as a skull and crossbones in some of these places one can
   walk a long way without coming upon any grave less than an hundred and
   fifty years old some day when cook issues that promised monadnock
   you will see my tale the tomb which was inspired by one of these
   places such was the scene of my dream  a hideous hollow whose surface
   was covered with a coarse repulsive sort of long grass above which
   peeped the shocking stones and markers of decaying slate in a hillside
   were several tombs whose facades were in the last stages of
   decrepitude i had an odd idea that no living thing had trodden that
   ground for many centuries till loveman and i arrived it was very late
   in the night  probably in the small hours since a waning crescent
   moon had attained considerable height in the east loveman carried
   slung over his shoulder a portable telephone outfit; whilst i bore two
   spades we proceeded directly to a flat sepulchre near the centre of
   the horrible place and began to clear away the mossgrown earth which
   had been washed down upon it by the rains of innumerable years
   loveman in the dream looked exactly like the snapshots of himself
   which he has sent me  a large robust young man not the least semitic
   in features (albeit dark) and very handsome save for a pair of
   protruding ears we did not speak as he laid down his telephone outfit
   took a shovel and helped me clear away the earth and weeds we both
   seemed very much impressed with something  almost awestruck at last
   we completed these preliminaries and loveman stepped back to survey
   the sepulchre he seemed to know exactly what he was about to do and i
   also had an idea  though i cannot now remember what it was! all i
   recall is that we were following up some idea which loveman had gained
   as the result of extensive reading in some old rare books of which he
   possessed the only existing copies (loveman you may know has a vast
   library of rare first editions and other treasures precious to the
   bibliophiles heart) after some mental estimates loveman took up his
   shovel again and using it as a lever sought to pry up a certain slab
   which formed the top of the sepulchre he did not succeed so i
   approached and helped him with my own shovel finally we loosened the
   stone lifted it with our combined strength and heaved it away
   beneath was a black passageway with a flight of stone steps; but so
   horrible were the miasmic vapours which poured up from the pit that we
   stepped back for a while without making further observations then
   loveman picked up the telephone output and began to uncoil the wire 
   speaking for the first time as he did so

   im really sorry he said in a mellow pleasant voice; cultivated
   and not very deep to have to ask you to stay above ground but i
   couldnt answer for the consequences if you were to go down with me
   honestly i doubt if anyone with a nervous system like yours could see
   it through you cant imagine what i shall have to see and do  not
   even from what the book said and from what i have told you  and i
   dont think anyone without ironclad nerves could ever go down and come
   out of that place alive and sane at any rate this is no place for
   anybody who cant pass an army physical examination i discovered this
   thing and i am responsible in a way for anyone who goes with me  so i
   would not for a thousand dollars let you take the risk but ill keep
   you informed of every move i make by the telephone  you see ive
   enough wire to reach to the centre of the earth and back!

   i argued with him but he replied that if i did not agree he would
   call the thing off and get another fellowexplorer  he mentioned a dr
   burke a name altogether unfamiliar to me he added that it would be
   of no use for me to descend alone since he was sole possessor of the
   real key to the affair finally i assented and seated myself upon a
   marble bench close by the open grave telephone in hand he produced an
   electric lantern prepared the telephone wire for unreeling and
   disappeared down the damp stone steps the insulated wire rustling as
   it uncoiled for a moment i kept track of the glow of his lantern but
   suddenly it faded out as if there were a turn in the stone staircase
   then all was still after this came a period of dull fear and anxious
   waiting the crescent moon climbed higher and the mist or fog about
   the hollow seemed to thicken everything was horribly damp and bedewed
   and i thought i saw an owl flitting somewhere in the shadows then a
   clicking sounded in the telephone receiver

   lovecraft  i think im finding it  the words came in a tense
   excited tone then a brief pause followed by more words in atone of
   ineffable awe and horror

   god lovecraft! if you could see what i am seeing! i now asked in
   great excitement what had happened loveman answered in a trembling
   voice: i cant tell you  i dont dare  i never dreamed of this  i
   cant tell  its enough to unseat any mind  wait  whats this? then
   a pause a clicking in the receiver and a sort of despairing groan
   speech again  lovecraft  for gods sake  its all up  beat it!
   beat it! dont lose a second! i was now thoroughly alarmed and
   frantically asked loveman to tell what the matter was he replied only
   never mind! hurry! then i felt a sort of offence through my fear  it
   irked me that anyone should assume that i would be willing to desert a
   companion in peril i disregarded his advice and told him i was coming
   down to his aid but he cried:

   dont be a fool  its too late  theres no use  nothing you or
   anyone can do now he seemed calmer  with a terrible resigned calm
   as if he had met and recognised an inevitable inescapable doom yet he
   was obviously anxious that i should escape some unknown peril

   for gods sake get out of this if you can find the way! im not
   joking  so long lovecraft wont see you again  god! beat it! beat
   it! as he shrieked out the last words his tone was a frenzied
   crescendo i have tried to recall the wording as nearly as possible
   but i cannot reproduce the tone there followed a long  hideously long
    period of silence i tried to move to assist loveman but was
   absolutely paralysed the slightest motion was an impossibility i
   could speak however and kept calling excitedly into the telephone 
   loveman! loveman! what is it? whats the trouble? but he did not
   reply and then came the unbelievably frightful thing  the awful
   unexplainable almost unmentionable thing i have said that loveman was
   now silent but after a vast interval of terrified waiting another
   clicking came into the receiver i called loveman  are you there?
   and in reply came a voice  a thing which i cannot describe by any
   words i know shall i say that it was hollow  very deep  fluid 
   gelatinous  indefinitely distant  unearthly  guttural  thick? what
   shall i say? in that telephone i heard it; heard it as i sat on a
   marble bench in that very ancient unknown cemetery with the crumbling
   stones and tombs and long grass and dampness and the owl and the waning
   crescent moon up from the sepulchre it came and this is what it said:

   you fool loveman is dead!

   well thats the whole damn thing! i fainted in the dream and the next
   i knew i was awake  and with a prize headache! i dont know yet what
   it was all about  what on (or under) earth we were looking for or
   what that hideous voice at the last was supposed to be i have read of
   ghouls  mould shades  but hell  the headache i had was worse than
   the dream! loveman will laugh when i tell him about that dream! in due
   time i intend to weave this picture into a story as i wove another
   dreampicture into the doom that came to sarnath i wonder though
   if i have a right to claim authorship of things i dream? i hate to take
   credit when i did not really think out the picture with my own
   conscious wits yet if i do not take credit whon heaven will i give
   credit tuh? coleridge claimed kubla khan so i guess ill claim the
   thing an let it go at that but believe muh that was some dream!

   life! ah life!

   what may this fluorescent pageant mean?

   who can the evanescent object glean?

   he that is dead is the key of life 

   gone is the symbol deep is the grave!

   man is a breath and life is the fire;

   birth is death and silence the choir

   wrest from the aeons the heart of gold!

   tear from the fabric the threads that are old!

   life! ah life!

   whilst martial echoes oer the wave resound
   and europes gore incarnadines the ground;
   today no foreign hero we bemoan
   but count the glowing virtues of our own!
   illustrious lee! around whose honourd name
   entwines a patriots and a christians fame;
   with whose just praise admiring nations ring
   and whom repenting foes contritely sing!
   when first our land fraternal fury bore
   and sumters guns alarmd the anxious shore;
   when factions reign ancestral rights oerthrew
   and sunderd states a mutual hatred knew;
   then clashd contending chiefs of kindred line
   in flesh to suffer and in fame to shine
   but oer them all majestic in his might
   rose lee unrivalld to sublimest height:
   with torturing choice defyd opposing fate
   and shunnd temptation for his native state!
   thus washington his monarchs rule oerturned
   when young columbia with rebellion burnd
   and what in washington the world reveres
   in lee with equal magnitude appears
   our nations father crownd with victry bays
   enjoys a loving lands eternal praise:
   let then our hearts with equal revrence greet
   his proud successor rising oer defeat!
   around his greatness pour disheartning woes
   but still he towrs above his conquering foes
   silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blame
   th unspotted leader by a traitors name
   if such was lee let blushing justice mourn
   and traitrous liberty endure our scorn!
   as philopoemen once sublimely strove
   and earnd declining hellas thankful love;
   so followed lee the purest patriots part
   and wakd the worship of the grateful heart:
   the south her soul in bodyd form discerns;
   the north from lee a nobler freedom learns!
   attend! ye sons of albions ancient race
   whateer your country and whateer your place;
   lees valiant deeds though dear to southern song
   to all our saxon strain as well belong
   courage like his the parent island won
   and led an empire past the setting sun;
   to realms unknown our laws and language bore
   raisd englands banner on the desert shore;
   crushd the proud rival and subdued the sea
   for ages past and aeons yet to be!
   from scotias hilly bounds the paean rolls
   and africs distant cape great lee extols;
   the sainted soul and manly mien combine
   to grace britannias and virginias line
   as dullards now in thoughtless fervour prate
   of shameful peace and sing th unmanly state;
   as churls their piping reprobations shriek
   and damn the heroes that protect the weak;
   let lees brave shade the timid throng accost
   and give them back the manhood they have lost!
   what kindlier spirit breathing from on high
   can teach us how to live and how to die?

   in the valley of nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly tearing a
   path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a
   great upastree and within the depths of the valley where the light
   reaches not move forms not meant to be beheld rank is the herbage on
   each slope where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the
   stones of ruined palaces twining tightly about broken columns and
   strange monoliths and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten
   hands and in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap
   little apes while in and out of deep treasurevaults writhe poison
   serpents and scaly things without a name vast are the stones which
   sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss and mighty were the walls from
   which they fell for all time did their builders erect them and in
   sooth they yet serve nobly for beneath them the grey toad makes his
   habitation
         at the very bottom of the valley lies the river than whose
   waters are slimy and filled with weeds from hidden springs it rises
   and to subterranean grottoes it flows so that the daemon of the valley
   knows not why its waters are red nor whither they are bound
         the genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the daemon of the
   valley saying i am old and forget much tell me the deeds and
   aspect and name of them who built these things of stone and the
   daemon replied i am memory and am wise in lore of the past but i
   too am old these beings were like the waters of the river than not to
   be understood their deeds i recall not for they were but of the
   moment their aspect i recall dimly it was like to that of the little
   apes in the trees their name i recall clearly for it rhymed with that
   of the river these beings of yesterday were called man
         so the genie flew back to the thin horned moon and the daemon
   looked intently at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling
   courtyard

   metrical regularity
   by h p lovecraft
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   published july 1915
   9569metrical regularityh p lovecraft

                deteriores omnes sumus licentia  terence

   of the various forms of decadence manifest in the poetical art of the
   present age none strikes more harshly on our sensibilities than the
   alarming decline in that harmonious regularity of metre which adorned
   the poetry of our immediate ancestors

   that metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a
   principle which not even the assertions of an aristotle or the
   pronouncements of a plato can disestablish as old a critic as
   dionysius of halicarnassus and as modern an philosopher as hegel have
   each affirmed that versification in poetry is not alone a necessary
   attribute but the very foundation as well; hegel indeed placing
   metre above metaphorical imagination as the essence of all poetic
   creation

   science can likewise trace the metrical instinct from the very infancy
   of mankind or even beyond to the prehuman age of the apes nature is
   in itself an unending succession of regular impulses the steady
   recurrence of the seasons and of the moonlight the coming and going of
   the day the ebb and flow of the tides the beating of the heart and
   pulses the tread of the feet in walking the countless other phenomena
   of like regularity have all combined to inculcate in the human brain a
   rhythmic sense which is as manifest in the most uncultivated as in the
   most polished of peoples metre therefore is no such false artifice
   as most exponents of radicalism would have us believe but is instead a
   natural and inevitable embellishment to poesy which succeeding ages
   should develop and refine rather than maim or destroy

   like other instincts the metric sense has taken on different aspects
   among different races savages show it in its simplest form while
   dancing to the sound of primitive drums; barbarians display it in their
   religious and other chantings; civilized peoples utilize it for their
   formal poetry either as measured quantity like that of greek and
   roman verse or as measured accentual stress like that of our own
   english verse precision of metre is thus no mere display of
   meretricious ornament but a logical evolution from eminently natural
   sources

   it is the contention of the ultramodern poet as enunciated by mrs j
   w renshaw in her recent article on the autocracy of art (the
   looking glass for may) that the truly inspired bard must chant forth
   his feelings independently of form or language permitting each
   changing impulse to alter the rhythm of his lay and blindly resigning
   his reason to the fine frenzy of his mood this contention is of
   course founded upon the assumption that poetry is superintellectual;
   the expression of a soul which outranks the mind and its precepts
   now while avoiding the impeachment of this dubious theory we must
   needs remark that the laws of nature cannot so easily be outdistanced
   however much true poesy may overtop the produce of the brain it must
   still be affected by natural laws which are universal and inevitable
   wherefore it is the various clearly defined natural forms through which
   the emotions seek expression indeed we feel even unconsciously the
   fitness of certain types of metre for certain types of thought and in
   perusing a crude or irregular poem are often abruptly repelled by the
   unwarranted variations made by the bard either through his ignorance
   or his perverted taste we are naturally shocked at the clothing of a
   grave subject in anapestic metre or the treatment of a long and lofty
   theme in short choppy lines this latter defect is what repels us so
   much from coninghtons really scholarly translation of the aeneid

   what the radicals so wantonly disregard in their eccentric performances
   is unity of thought amidst their wildly repeated leaps from one rough
   metre to another they ignore the underlying uniformity of each of
   their poems scene may change; atmosphere may vary; yet one poem cannot
   carry but one definite message and to suit this ultimate and
   fundamental message but one metre must be selected and sustained to
   accommodate the minor inequalities of tone in a poem one regular metre
   will amply lend itself to diversity our chief but now annoyingly
   neglected measure the heroic couplet is capable of taking on the
   infinite shades of expression by the right selection of sequence of
   words and by the proper placing of the caesura or pause in each line
   dr blair in his 38th lecture explains and illustrates with admirable
   perspicuity the importance of the caesuras location in varying the
   flow of heroic verse it is also possible to lend variety to a poem by
   using very judiciously occasional feet of a metre different from that
   of the body of the work this is generally done without disturbing the
   syllabification and it in no way impairs or obscures the dominant
   measure

   most amusing of all the claims of the radical is the assertion that
   true poetic fervor can never be confined to regular metre; that the
   wildeyed longhaired rider of pegasus must inflict upon a suffering
   public in unaltered form the vague conceptions which flit in noble
   chaos through his exalted soul while it is perfectly obvious that the
   hour of rare inspiration must be improved without the hindrance of
   grammars or rhyming dictionaries it is no less obvious that the
   succeeding hour of calmer contemplation may very profitably be devoted
   to amendment and polishing the language of the heart must be
   clarified and made intelligible to other hearts else its purport will
   forever be confined to its creator if natural laws of metrical
   construction be willfully set aside the readers attention will be
   distracted from the soul of the poem to its uncouth and illfitting
   dress the more nearly perfect the metre the less conspicuous its
   presence; hence if the poet desires supreme consideration for his
   matter he should make his verses so smooth that the sense may never be
   interrupted

   the ill effect of metrical laxity on the younger generation of poets is
   enormous these latest suitors of the muse not yet sufficiently
   trained to distinguish between their own artless crudities and the
   cultivated monstrosities of the educated but radical bard come to
   regard with distrust the orthodox critics and to believe that no
   grammatical rhetorical or metrical skill is necessary to their own
   development the result cannot but be a race of churlish cacophonous
   hybrids whose amorphous outcries will waver uncertainly betwixt prose
   and verse absorbing the vices of both and the virtues of neither

   when proper consideration shall be taken of the perfect naturalness of
   polished metre a wholesome reaction against the present chaos must
   inevitably occur; so that the few remaining disciples of conservatism
   and good taste may justly entertain one last lingering hope of hearing
   from modern lyres the stately heroics of pope the majestic blank verse
   of thomson the terse octosyllabics of swift the sonorous quatrains of
   gray and the lively anapests of sheridan and moore

nathicana[edit]

   by hp lovecraft
   and alfred galpin

   it was in the pale garden of zais;
   the mistshrouded gardens of zais
   where blossoms the white naphalot
   the redolent herald of midnight
   there slumber the still lakes of crystal
   and streamlets that flow without murmring;
   smooth streamlets from caverns of kathos
   where broodth the calm spirits of twilight
   and over the lakes and the streamlets
   are bridges of pure alabaster
   white bridges all cunningly carven
   with figures of fairies and daemons
   here glimmer strange suns and strange planets
   and strange is the crescent bnapis
   that sets yond the ivygrown ramparts
   where thicken the dusk of the evening
   here fall the white vapours of yabon;
   and here in the swirl of vapours
   i saw the divine nathicana;
   the garlanded white nathicana;
   the sloweyed redlipped nathicana;
   the silvervoiced sweet nathicana;
   the palerobd belovd nathicana
   and ever was she my beloved
   from ages when time was unfashioned
   now anything fashiond but yabon
   and here dwelt we ever and ever
   the innocent children of zais
   at peace in the paths and the arbours
   whitecrowned with the blest nephalote
   how oft would we float in the twilight
   oer flowrcoverd pastures and hillsides
   all white with the lowly astalthon;
   the lowly yet lovely astalthon
   and dream in a world made of dreaming
   the dreams that are fairer than aidenn;
   bright dreams that are truer than reason!
   so dreamed and so lovd we thro ages
   till came the cursed season of dzannin;
   the daemondamnd season of dzannin;
   when red shone the suns and the planets
   and red leamed the crescent banapis
   and red fell the vapours of yabon
   then reddend the blossoms and streamlets
   and lakes that lay under the bridges
   and even the calm alabaster
   glowed pink with uncanny reflections
   till all the carvd fairies and daemons
   leerd redly from the backgrounds of shadow
   now reddend my vision and madly
   i strove to peer thro the dense curtain
   and glimpsed the divine nathicana;
   the pure everpale nathicana;
   the lovd the unchangd nathicana
   but vortex on vortex of madness
   beclouded my labouring vision;
   my damnable reddening vision
   that built a new world for my seeing;
   a new world of redness and darkness
   a horrible coma calld living
   so now in this coma calld living
   i view the bright phantons of beauty;
   the false hollow phantoms of beauty
   that cloak all the evils of dzannin
   i view them with infinite longing
   so like do they seem to my lovd one:
   yet foul for their eyes shines their evil;
   their cruel and pitiless evil
   more evil than thaphron and latgoz
   twice ill fro its gorgeous concealment
   and only in slumbers of midnight
   appears the lost maid nathicana
   the pallid the pure nathicana
   who fades at the glance of the dreamer
   again and again do i seek her;
   i woo with deep draughts of plathotis
   deep draughts brewd in wine of astarte
   and strengthend with tears of long weeping
   i yearn for the gardens of zais;
   the lovely lost garden of zais
   where blossoms the white nephalot
   the redolent herald of midnight
   the last potent draught am i brewing;
   a draught that the daemons delight in;
   a draught that will banish the redness;
   the horrible coma calld living
   soon soon if i fail not in brewing
   the redness and madness will vanish
   and deep in the wormpeopled darkness
   will rot the base chains that have bound me
   once more shall the gardens of zais
   dawn white on my longtorturd vision
   and there midst the vapours of yabon
   will stand the divine nathicana;
   the deathless restord nathicana
   whose like is not met with in living

   through the ghoulguarded gateways of slumber
     past the wanmooned abysses of night
   i have lived oer my lives without number
     i have sounded all things with my sight;
   and i struggle and shriek ere the daybreak being driven to madness
   with fright
   i have whirled with the earth at the dawning
     when the sky was a vaporous flame;
   i have seen the dark universe yawning
     where the black planets roll without aim
   where they roll in their horror unheeded without knowledge or lustre
   or name
   i had drifted oer seas without ending
     under sinister greyclouded skies
   that the manyforked lightning is rending
     that resound with hysterical cries;
   with the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise
   i have plunged like a deer through the arches
     of the hoary primordial grove
   where the oaks feel the presence that marches
     and stalks on where no spirit dares rove
   and i flee from a thing that surrounds me and leers through dead
   branches above
   i have stumbled by caveridden mountains
     that rise barren and bleak from the plain
   i have drunk of the fogfoetid fountains
     that ooze down to the marsh and the main;
   and in hot cursed tarns i have seen things i care not to gaze on
   again
   i have scanned the vast ivyclad palace
     i have trod its untenanted hall
   where the moon rising up from the valleys
     shows the tapestried things on the wall;
   strange figures discordantly woven that i cannot endure to recall
   i have peered from the casements in wonder
     at the mouldering meadows around
   at the manyroofed village laid under
     the curse of a gravegirdled ground;
   and from rows of white urncarven marble i listen intently for sound
   i have haunted the tombs of the ages
     i have flown on the pinions of fear
   where the smokebelching erebus rages;
     where the jokulls loom snowclad and drear:
   and in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can
   cheer
   i was old when the pharaohs first mounted
     the jeweldecked throne by the nile;
   i was old in those epochs uncounted
     when i and i only was vile;
   and man yet untainted and happy dwelt in bliss on the far arctic
   isle
   oh great was the sin of my spirit
     and great is the reach of its doom;
   not the pity of heaven can cheer it
     nor can respite be found in the tomb:
   down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom
   through the ghoulguarded gateways of slumber
     past the wanmooned abysses of night
   i have lived oer my lives without number
     i have sounded all things with my sight;
   and i struggle and shriek ere the daybreak being driven to madness
   with fright

   out of what crypt they crawl i cannot tell
   but every night i see the rubbery things
   black horned and slender with membranous wings
   they come in legions on the north winds swell
   with obscene clutch that titillates and stings
   snatching me off on monstrous voyagings
   to grey worlds hidden deep in nightmares well
   over the jagged peaks of thok they sweep
   heedless of all the cries i try to make
   and down the nether pits to that foul lake
   where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep
   but ho! if only they would make some sound
   or wear a face where faces should be found!

   notes on writing weird fiction  (1933)
   by hp lovecraft
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   written in 1933 published in the june 1937 issue of the amateur
   correspondent
   200728notes on writing weird fictionhp lovecraft1933

   my reason for writing stories is to give myself the satisfaction of
   visualising more clearly and detailedly and stably the vague elusive
   fragmentary impressions of wonder beauty and adventurous expectancy
   which are conveyed to me by certain sights (scenic architectural
   atmospheric etc) ideas occurrences and images encountered in art
   and literature i choose weird stories because they suit my inclination
   bestone of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve
   momentarily the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of
   the galling limitations of time space and natural law which forever
   imprison us and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic
   spaces beyond the radius of our sight and analysis these stories
   frequently emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest
   and strongest emotion and the one which best lends itself to the
   creation of naturedefying illusions horror and the unknown or the
   strange are always closely connected so that it is hard to create a
   convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or
   outsideness without laying stress on the emotion of fear the reason
   why time plays a great part in so many of my tales is that this element
   looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible
   thing in the universe conflict with time seems to me the most potent
   and fruitful theme in all human expression
         while my chosen form of storywriting is obviously a special and
   perhaps a narrow one it is none the less a persistent and permanent
   type of expression as old as literature itself there will always be a
   certain small percentage of persons who feel a burning curiosity about
   unknown outer space and a burning desire to escape from the
   prisonhouse of the known and the real into those enchanted lands of
   incredible adventure and infinite possibilities which dreams open up to
   us and which things like deep woods fantastic urban towers and
   flaming sunsets momentarily suggest these persons include great
   authors as well as insignificant amateurs like myselfdunsany poe
   arthur machen m r james algernon blackwood and walter de la mare
   being typical masters in this field
         as to how i write a storythere is no one way each one of my
   tales has a different history once or twice i have literally written
   out a dream; but usually i start with a mood or idea or image which i
   wish to express and revolve it in my mind until i can think of a good
   way of embodying it in some chain of dramatic occurrences capable of
   being recorded in concrete terms i tend to run through a mental list
   of the basic conditions or situations best adapted to such a mood or
   idea or image and then begin to speculate on logical and naturally
   motivated explanations of the given mood or idea or image in terms of
   the basic condition or situation chosen
         the actual process of writing is of course as varied as the
   choice of theme and initial conception; but if the history of all my
   tales were analysed it is just possible that the following set of
   rules might be deduced from the average procedure:
    1 prepare a synopsis or scenario of events in the order of their
       absolute occurrencenot the order of their narration describe
       with enough fulness to cover all vital points and motivate all
       incidents planned details comments and estimates of consequences
       are sometimes desirable in this temporary framework
    2 prepare a second synopsis or scenario of eventsthis one in order
       of narration (not actual occurrence) with ample fulness and
       detail and with notes as to changing perspective stresses and
       climax change the original synopsis to fit if such a change will
       increase the dramatic force or general effectiveness of the story
       interpolate or delete incidents at willnever being bound by the
       original conception even if the ultimate result be a tale wholly
       different from that first planned let additions and alterations be
       made whenever suggested by anything in the for mulating process
    3 write out the storyrapidly fluently and not too
       criticallyfollowing the second or narrativeorder synopsis
       change incidents and plot whenever the developing process seems to
       suggest such change never being bound by any previous design if
       the development suddenly reveals new opportunities for dramatic
       effect or vivid story telling add whatever is thought
       advantageousgoing back and reconciling the early parts to the new
       plan insert and delete whole sections if necessary or desirable
       trying different beginnings and endings until the best arrangement
       is found but be sure that all references throughout the story are
       thoroughly reconciled with the final design remove all possible
       superfluitieswords sentences paragraphs or whole episodes or
       elementsobserving the usual precautions about the reconciling of
       all references
    4 revise the entire text paying attention to vocabulary syntax
       rhythm of prose proportioning of parts niceties of tone grace
       and convincingness of transitions (scene to scene slow and
       detailed action to rapid and sketchy timecovering action and vice
       versa etc etc etc) effectiveness of beginning ending
       climaxes etc dramatic suspense and interest plausibility and
       atmosphere and various other elements
    5 prepare a neatly typed copynot hesitating to add final revisory
       touches where they seem in order

   the first of these stages is often purely a mental onea set of
   conditions and happenings being worked out in my head and never set
   down until i am ready to prepare a detailed synopsis of events in order
   of narration then too i sometimes begin even the actual writing
   before i know how i shall develop the ideathis beginning forming a
   problem to be motivated and exploited
         there are i think four distinct types of weird story; one
   expressing a mood or feeling another expressing a pictorial
   conception a third expressing a general situation condition legend
   or intellectual conception and a fourth explaining a definite tableau
   or specific dramatic situation or climax in another way weird tales
   may be grouped into two rough categoriesthose in which the marvel or
   horror concerns some condition or phenomenon and those in which it
   concerns some action of persons in connexion with a bizarre condition
   or phenomenon
         each weird storyto speak more particularly of the horror
   typeseems to involve five definite elements: (a) some basic
   underlying horror or abnormalitycondition entity etc (b) the
   general effects or bearings of the horror (c) the mode of
   manifestationobject embodying the horror and phenomena observed
   (d) the types of fearreaction pertaining to the horror and (e) the
   specific effects of the horror in relation to the given set of
   conditions
         in writing a weird story i always try very carefully to achieve
   the right mood and atmosphere and place the emphasis where it belongs
   one cannot except in immature pulp charlatanfiction present an
   account of impossible improbable or inconceivable phenomena as a
   commonplace narrative of objective acts and conventional emotions
   inconceivable events and conditions have a special handicap to over
   come and this can be accomplished only through the maintenance of a
   careful realism in every phase of the story except that touching on the
   one given marvel this marvel must be treated very impressively and
   deliberatelywith a careful emotional buildupelse it will seem
   flat and unconvincing being the principal thing in the story its mere
   existence should overshadow the characters and events but the
   characters and events must be consistent and natural except where they
   touch the single marvel in relation to the central wonder the
   characters should shew the same overwhelming emotion which similar
   characters would shew toward such a wonder in real life never have a
   wonder taken for granted even when the characters are supposed to be
   accustomed to the wonder i try to weave an air of awe and
   impressiveness corresponding to what the reader should feel a casual
   style ruins any serious fantasy
         atmosphere not action is the great desideratum of weird
   fiction indeed all that a wonder story can ever be is a vivid picture
   of a certain type of human mood the moment it tries to be anything
   else it becomes cheap puerile and unconvincing prime emphasis should
   be given to subtle suggestionimperceptible hints and touches of
   selective associative detail which express shadings of moods and build
   up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the unreal avoid bald
   catalogues of incredible happenings which can have no substance or
   meaning apart from a sustaining cloud of colour and symbolism
         these are the rules or standards which i have
   followedconsciously or unconsciouslyever since i first attempted
   the serious writing of fantasy that my results are successful may well
   be disputedbut i feel at least sure that had i ignored the
   considerations mentioned in the last few paragraphs they would have
   been much worse than they are

   nyarlathotep    the crawling chaos    i am the last    i will
   tell the audient void   

   i do not recall distinctly when it began but it was months ago the
   general tension was horrible to a season of political and social
   upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous
   physical danger; a danger widespread and allembracing such a danger
   as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night i
   recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces and
   whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat
   or acknowledge to himself that he had heard a sense of monstrous guilt
   was upon the land and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill
   currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places there was a
   daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons  the autumn heat
   lingered fearsomely and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the
   universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of
   gods or forces which were unknown

   and it was then that nyarlathotep came out of egypt who he was none
   could tell but he was of the old native blood and looked like a
   pharaoh the fellahin knelt when they saw him yet could not say why
   he said he had risen up out of the blackness of twentyseven centuries
   and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet into the
   lands of civilisation came nyarlathotep swarthy slender and
   sinister always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and
   combining them into instruments yet stranger he spoke much of the
   sciences  of electricity and psychology  and gave exhibitions of
   power which sent his spectators away speechless yet which swelled his
   fame to exceeding magnitude men advised one another to see
   nyarlathotep and shuddered and where nyarlathotep went rest
   vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare
   never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem;
   now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small
   hours that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale
   pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges and
   old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky

   i remember when nyarlathotep came to my city  the great the old the
   terrible city of unnumbered crimes my friend had told me of him and
   of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations and i
   burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries my friend
   said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered
   imaginings; and what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room
   prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy and in the
   sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never
   been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes and i heard it
   hinted abroad that those who knew nyarlathotep looked on sights which
   others saw not

   it was in the hot autumn that i went through the night with the
   restless crowds to see nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up
   the endless stairs into the choking room and shadowed on a screen i
   saw hooded forms amidst ruins and yellow evil faces peering from
   behind fallen monuments and i saw the world battling against
   blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space;
   whirling churning struggling around the dimming cooling sun then
   the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators and
   hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than i can tell came
   out and squatted on the heads and when i who was colder and more
   scientific than the rest mumbled a trembling protest about imposture
   and static electricity nyarlathotep drove us all out down the dizzy
   stairs into the damp hot deserted midnight streets i screamed aloud
   that i was not afraid; that i never could be afraid; and others
   screamed with me for solace we swore to one another that the city was
   exactly the same and still alive; and when the electric lights began
   to fade we cursed the company over and over again and laughed at the
   queer faces we made

   i believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon for
   when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious
   involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations
   though we dared not think of them once we looked at the pavement and
   found the blocks loose and displaced by grass with scarce a line of
   rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run and again we saw a
   tramcar lone windowless dilapidated and almost on its side when
   we gazed around the horizon we could not find the third tower by the
   river and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged
   at the top then we split up into narrow columns each of which seemed
   drawn in a different direction one disappeared in a narrow alley to
   the left leaving only the echo of a shocking moan another filed down
   a weedchoked subway entrance howling with a laughter that was mad my
   own column was sucked toward the open country and presently i felt a
   chill which was not of the hot autumn; for as we stalked out on the
   dark moor we beheld around us the hellish moonglitter of evil snows
   trackless inexplicable snows swept asunder in one direction only
   where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls the column
   seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf i
   lingered behind for the black rift in the greenlitten snow was
   frightful and i thought i had heard the reverberations of a
   disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my power to linger was
   slight as if beckoned by those who had gone before i halffloated
   between the titanic snowdrifts quivering and afraid into the
   sightless vortex of the unimaginable

   screamingly sentient dumbly delirious only the gods that were can
   tell a sickened sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not
   hands and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation
   corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities charnel winds that
   brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low beyond the worlds
   vague ghosts of monstrous things; halfseen columns of unsanctified
   temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy
   vacua above the spheres of light and darkness and through this
   revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled maddening beating of
   drums and thin monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from
   inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time; the detestable pounding
   and piping whereunto dance slowly awkwardly and absurdly the
   gigantic tenebrous ultimate gods  the blind voiceless mindless
   gargoyles whose soul is nyarlathotep

   as columbias brave scions in anger arrayd
    once defyd a proud monarch and built a new nation;
   `gainst their brothers of britain unsheathd the sharp blade
    that hath neer met defeat nor endurd desecration;
     so must we in this hour
     show our valour and powr
   and dispel the black perils that over us lowr:
    whilst the sons of britannia no longer our foes
    will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows!
   see the banners of liberty float in the breeze
    that plays light oer the regions our fathers defended;
   hear the voice of the million resound oer the leas
    as deeds of the past are proclaimd and commended;
     and in splendour on high
     where our flags proudly fly
   see the folds we tore down flung again to the sky:
    for the emblem of england in kinship unfurld
    shall divide with old glory the praise of the world!
   buryd now are the hatreds of subject and king
    and the strife that once sunderd an empire hath vanishd
   with the fame of the saxon the heavens shall ring
    as the vultures of darkness are baffled and banishd;
     and the broad british sea
     of her enemies free
   shall in tribute bow gladly columbia to thee:
    for the friends of the right in the field side by side
    form a fabric of freedom no hand can divide!

   old bugs

      an extemporaneous sob story by marcus lollius proconsul of gaul

   sheehans pool room which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart
   of chicagos stockyard district is not a nice place its air
   freighted with a thousand odours such as coleridge may have found at
   cologne too seldom knows the purifying rays of the sun; but fights for
   space with the acrid fumes of unnumbered cheap cigars and cigarettes
   which dangle from the coarse lips of unnumbered human animals that
   haunt the place day and night but the popularity of sheehans remains
   unimpaired; and for this there is a reason  a reason obvious to
   anyone who will take the trouble to analyse the mixed stenches
   prevailing there over and above the fumes and sickening closeness
   rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land but now happily
   banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent
   government  the aroma of strong wicked whiskey  a precious kind of
   forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950

   sheehans is the acknowledged centre to chicagos subterranean traffic
   in liquor and narcotics and as such has a certain dignity which
   extends even to the unkempt attaches of the place; but there was until
   lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity  one who shared
   the squalor and filth but not the importance of sheehans he was
   called old bugs and was the most disreputable object in a
   disreputable environment what he had once been many tried to guess;
   for his language and mode of utterance when intoxicated to a certain
   degree were such as to excite wonderment; but what he was presented
   less difficulty  for old bugs in superlative degree epitomised
   the pathetic species known as the bum or the downandouter whence
   he had come no one could tell one night he had burst wildly into
   sheehans foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh;
   and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs
   had hung about ever since mopping floors cleaning cuspidors and
   glasses and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange
   for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and
   sane

   he talked but little and usually in the common jargon of the
   underworld; but occasionally when inflamed by an unusually generous
   dose of crude whiskey would burst forth into strings of
   incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse
   which led certain habitués to conjecture that he had seen better days
   one steady patron  a bank defaulter under cover  came to converse
   with him quite regularly and from the tone of his discourse ventured
   the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day but the
   only tangible clue to old bugs past was a faded photograph which he
   constantly carried about with him  the photograph of a young woman of
   noble and beautiful features this he would sometimes draw from his
   tattered pocket carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper
   and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and
   tenderness it was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen
   would be likely to know but of a lady of breeding and quality garbed
   in the quaint attire of thirty years before old bugs himself seemed
   also to belong to the past for his nondescript clothing bore every
   hallmark of antiquity he was a man of immense height probably more
   than six feet though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this
   fact his hair a dirty white and falling out in patches was never
   combed; and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard
   which seemed always to remain at the bristling stage  never shaven 
   yet never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers his
   features had perhaps been noble once but were now seamed with the
   ghastly effects of terrible dissipation at one time  probably in
   middle life  he had evidently been grossly fat; but now he was
   horribly lean the purple flesh hanging in loose pouches under his
   bleary eyes and upon his cheeks altogether old bugs was not pleasing
   to look upon

   the disposition of old bugs was as odd as his aspect ordinarily he was
   true to the derelict type  ready to do anything for a nickel or a
   dose of whiskey or hasheesh  but at rare intervals he shewed the
   traits which earned him his name then he would try to straighten up
   and a certain fire would creep into the sunken eyes his demeanour
   would assume an unwonted grace and even dignity; and the sodden
   creatures around him would sense something of superiority  something
   which made them less ready to give the usual kicks and cuffs to the
   poor butt and drudge at these times he would shew a sardonic humour
   and make remarks which the folk of sheehans deemed foolish and
   irrational but the spells would soon pass and once more old bugs
   would resume his eternal floorscrubbing and cuspidorcleaning but for
   one thing old bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishment
    and that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced
   for their first drink the old man would then rise from the floor in
   anger and excitement muttering threats and warnings and seeking to
   dissuade the novices from embarking upon their course of seeing life
   as it is he would sputter and fume exploding into sesquipedalian
   admonitions and strange oaths and animated by a frightful earnestness
   which brought a shudder to more than one drugracked mind in the
   crowded room but after a time his alcoholenfeebled brain would wander
   from the subject and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to
   his mop or cleaningrag

   i do not think that many of sheehans regular patrons will ever forget
   the day that young alfred trever came he was rather a find  a rich
   and highspirited youth who would go the limit in anything he
   undertook  at least that was the verdict of pete schultz sheehans
   runner who had come across the boy at lawrence college in the small
   town of appleton wisconsin trever was the son of prominent parents in
   appleton his father karl trever was an attorney and citizen of
   distinction whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a
   poetess under her maiden name of eleanor wing alfred was himself a
   scholar and poet of distinction though cursed with a certain childish
   irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for sheehans runner he
   was blond handsome and spoiled; vivacious and eager to taste the
   several forms of dissipation about which he had read and heard at
   lawrence he had been prominent in the mockfraternity of tappa tappa
   keg where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young
   roysterers; but this immature collegiate frivolity did not satisfy
   him he knew deeper vices through books and he now longed to know them
   at first hand perhaps this tendency toward wildness had been
   stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he had been subjected at
   home; for mrs trever had particular reason for training her only child
   with rigid severity she had in her own youth been deeply and
   permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by the case of one
   to whom she had for a time been engaged

   young galpin the fiancé in question had been one of appletons most
   remarkable sons attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful
   mentality he won vast fame at the university of wisconsin and at the
   age of twentythree returned to appleton to take up a professorship at
   lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of appletons fairest
   and most brilliant daughter for a season all went happily till
   without warning the storm burst evil habits dating from a first drink
   taken years before in woodland seclusion made themselves manifest in
   the young professor; and only by a hurried resignation did he escape a
   nasty prosecution for injury to the habits and morals of the pupils
   under his charge his engagement broken galpin moved east to begin
   life anew; but before long appletonians heard of his dismissal in
   disgrace from new york university where he had obtained an
   instructorship in english galpin now devoted his time to the library
   and lecture platform preparing volumes and speeches on various
   subjects connected with belles lettres and always shewing a genius so
   remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon him for
   his past mistakes his impassioned lectures in defence of villon poe
   verlaine and oscar wilde were applied to himself as well and in the
   short indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement
   at a certain cultured home on park avenue but then the blow fell a
   final disgrace compared to which the others had been as nothing
   shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in galpins
   reform; and the young man abandoned his name and disappeared from
   public view rumour now and then associated him with a certain consul
   hasting whose work for the stage and for motionpicture companies
   attracted a certain degree of attention because of its scholarly
   breadth and depth; but hasting soon disappeared from the public eye
   and galpin became only a name for parents to quote in warning accents
   eleanor wing soon celebrated her marriage to karl trever a rising
   young lawyer and of her former admirer retained only enough memory to
   dictate the naming of her only son and the moral guidance of that
   handsome and headstrong youth now in spite of all that guidance
   alfred trever was at sheehans and about to take his first drink

   boss cried schultz as he entered the vilesmelling room with his
   young victim meet my friend al trever bes li1 sport up at
   lawrence  thasn appleton wis y know some swell guy too  s
   fathers a big corpration lawyer up in his burg n s mothers some
   fiery genius he wants to see life as she is  wants to know what the
   real lightnin juice tastes like  so jusremember hes me friend an
   treat im right

   as the names trever lawrence and appleton fell on the air the
   loafers seemed to sense something unusual perhaps it was only some
   sound connected with the clicking balls of the pool tables or the
   rattling glasses that were brought from the cryptic regions in the rear
    perhaps only that plus some strange rustling of the dirty draperies
   at the one dingy windowbut many thought that someone in the room had
   gritted his teeth and drawn a very sharp breath

   glad to know you sheehan said trever in a quiet wellbred tone

   this is my first experience in a place like this but i am a student
   of life and dont want to miss any experience theres poetry in this
   sort of thing you know  or perhaps you dont know but its all the
   same

   young feller responded the proprietor ya come tuh th right place
   tuh see life we got all kinds here  reel life an a good time the
   damn government can try tuh make folks good of it wants tuh but it
   cant stop a feller from hittiner up when he feels like it whaddya
   want feller  booze coke or some other sorta dope? yuh cant ask
   for nothin we aint got

   habitués say that it was at this point they noticed a cessation in the
   regular monotonous strokes of the mop

   i want whiskey  good oldfashioned rye! exclaimed trever
   enthusiastically ill tell you im good and tired of water after
   reading of the merry bouts fellows used to have in the old days i
   cant read an anacreontic without watering at the mouth  and its
   something a lot stronger than water that my mouth waters for!

   anacreontic  whatn hells that? several hangerson looked up as
   the young man went slightly beyond their depth but the bank defaulter
   under cover explained to them that anacreon was a gay old dog who lived
   many years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was
   just like sheehans

   let me see trever continued the defaulter didnt schultz say your
   mother is a literary person too?

   yes damn it replied trever but nothing like the old teian! shes
   one of those dull eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out
   of life nambypamby sort  ever heard of her? she writes under her
   maiden name of eleanor wing

   here it was that old bugs dropped his mop

   well heres yer stuff announced sheehan jovially as a tray of
   bottles and glasses was wheeled into the room good old rye an as
   fiery as ya kin find anyweres in chi

   the youths eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the
   brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him it repelled
   him horribly and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his
   determination to taste life to the full remained with him and he
   maintained a bold front but before his resolution was put to the test
   the unexpected intervened old bugs springing up from the crouching
   position in which he had hitherto been leaped at the youth and dashed
   from his hands the uplifted glass almost simultaneously attacking the
   tray of bottles and glasses with his mop and scattering the contents
   upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles
   and tumblers numbers of men or things which had been men dropped to
   the floor and began lapping at the puddles of spilled liquor but most
   remained immovable watching the unprecedented actions of the barroom
   drudge and derelict old bugs straightened up before the astonished
   trever and in a mild and cultivated voice said do not do this thing
   i was like you once and i did it now i am like  this

   what do you mean you damned old fool? shouted trever what do you
   mean by interfering with a gentleman in his pleasures? sheehan now
   recovering from his astonishment advanced and laid a heavy hand on the
   old waifs shoulder

   this is the last time far you old bird! he exclaimed furiously
   when a genlman wants tuh take a drink here by god he shall
   without you interferin now get th hell outa here afore i kick hell
   outa ya

   but sheehan had reckoned without scientific knowledge of abnormal
   psychology and the effects of nervous stimulus old bugs obtaining a
   firmer hold on his mop began to wield it like the javelin of a
   macedonian hoplite and soon cleared a considerable space around
   himself meanwhile shouting various disconnected bits of quotation
   among which was prominently repeated     the sons of belial blown
   with insolence and wine

   the room became pandemonium and men screamed and howled in fright at
   the sinister being they had aroused trever seemed dazed in the
   confusion and shrank to the wall as the strife thickened he shall
   not drink! he shall not drink! thus roared old bugs as he seemed to
   run out of  or rise above  quotations policemen appeared at the
   door attracted by the noise but for a time they made no move to
   intervene trever now thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his
   desire to see life via the vice route edged closer to the bluecoated
   newcomers could he but escape and catch a train for appleton he
   reflected he would consider his education in dissipation quite
   complete

   then suddenly old bugs ceased to wield his javelin and stopped still 
   drawing himself up more erectly than any denizen of the place had ever
   seen him before ave caesar moriturus te saluto! he shouted and
   dropped to the whiskeyreeking floor never to rise again

   subsequent impressions will never leave the mind of young trever the
   picture is blurred but ineradicable policemen ploughed a way through
   the crowd questioning everyone closely both about the incident and
   about the dead figure on the floor sheehan especially did they ply
   with inquiries yet without eliciting any information of value
   concerning old bugs then the bank defaulter remembered the picture
   and suggested that it be viewed and filed for identification at police
   headquarters an officer bent reluctantly over the loathsome glassyeyed
   form and found the tissuewrapped cardboard which he passed around
   among the others

   some chicken! leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face
   but those who were sober did not leer looking with respect and
   abashment at the delicate and spiritual features no one seemed able to
   place the subject and all wondered that the drugdegraded derelict
   should have such a portrait in his possession  that is all but the
   bank defaulter who was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather
   uneasily he had seen a little deeper beneath old bugs mask of utter
   degradation

   then the picture was passed to trever and a change came over the
   youth after the first start he replaced the tissue wrapping around
   the portrait as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place then
   he gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor noting its
   great height and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to
   appear now that the wretched flame of life had flickered out no he
   said hastily as the question was put to him he did not know the
   subject of the picture it was so old he added that no one now could
   be expected to recognise it

   but alfred trever did not speak the truth as many guessed when he
   offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in
   appleton over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of
   that picture and all his life he had known and loved its original

   for the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother

   the hours of night unheeded fly
   and in the grate the embers fade;
   vast shadows one by one pass by
   in silent daemon cavalcade
   but still the magic volume holds
   the rapturd eye in realms apart
   and fulgent sorcery enfolds
   the willing mind and eager heart
   the lonely room no more is there 
   for to the sight in pomp appear
   temples and cities poisd in air
   and blazing glories  sphere on sphere

   on recieving a picture of swans

   with pensive grace the melancholy swan
   mourns oer the tomb of luckless phaethon;
   on grassy banks the weeping poplars wave
   and guard with tender card the watry grave
   would that i might should i too proudly claim
   an heavnly parent or a godlike fame;
   when flown too high and dashd to depths below
   receive such tribute as a cygnus woe!
   the faithful bird that dumbly floats along
   sighs all the deeper for his want of song

   when long ago the gods created earth
   in joves fair image man was shaped at birth
   the beasts for lesser parts were next designed;
   yet were they too remote from humankind
   to fill the gap and join the rest to man
   tholympian host conceivd a clever plan
   a beast they wrought in semihuman figure
   filled it with vice and called the thing a nigger

   (ms found among the effects of the late richard h johnson phd
   curator of the cabot museum of archaeology boston mass)

i[edit]

   it is not likely that anyone in boston  or any alert reader elsewhere
    will ever forget the strange affair of the cabot museum the
   newspaper publicity given to that hellish mummy the antique and
   terrible rumours vaguely linked with it the morbid wave of interest
   and cult activities during 1932 and the frightful fate of the two
   intruders on december 1st of that year all combined to form one of
   those classic mysteries which go down for generations as folklore and
   become the nuclei of whole cycles of horrific speculation

   everyone seems to realise too that something very vital and
   unutterably hideous was suppressed in the public accounts of the
   culminant horrors those first disquieting hints as to the condition of
   one of the two bodies were dismissed and ignored too abruptly  nor
   were the singular modifications in the mummy given the followingup
   which their news value would normally prompt it also struck people as
   queer that the mummy was never restored to its case in these days of
   expert taxidermy the excuse that its disintegrating condition made
   exhibition impracticable seemed a peculiarly lame one

   as curator of the museum i am in a position to reveal all the
   suppressed facts but this i shall not do during my lifetime there are
   things about the world and universe which it is better for the majority
   not to know and i have not departed from the opinion in which all of
   us  museum staff physicians reporters and police  concurred at the
   period of the horror itself at the same time it seems proper that a
   matter of such overwhelming scientific and historic importance should
   not remain wholly unrecorded  hence this account which i have prepared
   for the benefit of serious students i shall place it among various
   papers to be examined after my death leaving its fate to the
   discretion of my executors certain threats and unusual events during
   the past weeks have led me to believe that my life  as well as that of
   other museum officials  is in some peril through the enmity of several
   widespread secret cults of asiatics polynesians and heterogeneous
   mystical devotees; hence it is possible that the work of the executors
   may not be long postponed [executors note: dr johnson died suddenly
   and rather mysteriously of heartfailure on april 22 1933 wentworth
   moore taxidermist of the museum disappeared around the middle of the
   preceding month on february 18 of the same year dr william minot who
   superintended a dissection connected with the case was stabbed in the
   back dying the following day]

   the real beginning of the horror i suppose was in 1879  long before
   my term as curator  when the museum acquired that ghastly
   inexplicable mummy from the orient shipping company its very discovery
   was monstrous and menacing for it came from a crypt of unknown origin
   and fabulous antiquity on a bit of land suddenly upheaved from the
   pacifics floor

   on may 11 1878 capt charles weatherbee of the freighter eridanus
   bound from wellington new zealand to valparaiso chile had sighted a
   new island unmarked on any chart and evidently of volcanic origin it
   projected quite boldly out of the sea in the form of a truncated cone
   a landingparty under capt weatherbee noted evidences of long
   submersion on the rugged slopes which they climbed while at the summit
   there were signs of recent destruction as by an earthquake among the
   scattered rubble were massive stones of manifestly artificial shaping
   and a little examination disclosed the presence of some of that
   prehistoric cyclopean masonry found on certain pacific islands and
   forming a perpetual archaeological puzzle

   finally the sailors entered a massive stone crypt  judged to have been
   part of a much larger edifice and to have originally lain far
   underground  in one corner of which the frightful mummy crouched
   after a short period of virtual panic caused partly by certain
   carvings on the walls the men were induced to move the mummy to the
   ship though it was only with fear and loathing that they touched it
   close to the body as if once thrust into its clothes was a cylinder
   of an unknown metal containing a roll of thin bluishwhite membrane of
   equally unknown nature inscribed with peculiar characters in a
   greyish indeterminable pigment in the centre of the vast stone floor
   was a suggestion of a trapdoor but the party lacked apparatus
   sufficiently powerful to move it

   the cabot museum then newly established saw the meagre reports of the
   discovery and at once took steps to acquire the mummy and the cylinder
   curator pickman made a personal trip to valparaiso and outfitted a
   schooner to search for the crypt where the thing had been found though
   meeting with failure in this matter at the recorded position of the
   island nothing but the seas unbroken expanse could be discerned and
   the seekers realised that the same seismic forces which had suddenly
   thrust the island up had carried it down again to the watery darkness
   where it had brooded for untold aeons the secret of that immovable
   trapdoor would never be solved the mummy and the cylinder however
   remained  and the former was placed on exhibition early in november
   1879 in the museums hall of mummies

   the cabot museum of archaeology which specialises in such remnants of
   ancient and unknown civilisations as do not fall within the domain of
   art is a small and scarcely famous institution though one of high
   standing in scientific circles it stands in the heart of bostons
   exclusive beacon hill district  in mt vernon street near joy 
   housed in a former private mansion with an added wing in the rear and
   was a source of pride to its austere neighbours until the recent
   terrible events brought it an undesirable notoriety the hall of
   mummies on the western side of the original mansion (which was designed
   by bulfinch and erected in 1819) on the second floor is justly
   esteemed by historians and anthropologists as harbouring the greatest
   collection of its kind in america here may be found typical examples
   of egyptian embalming from the earliest sakkarah specimens to the last
   coptic attempts of the eighth century; mummies of other cultures
   including the prehistoric indian specimens recently found in the
   aleutian islands; agonised pompeian figures moulded in plaster from
   tragic hollows in the ruin choking ashes; naturally mummified bodies
   from mines and other excavations in all parts of the earth  some
   surprised by their terrible entombment in the grotesque postures caused
   by their last tearing deaththroes  everything in short which any
   collection of the sort could well be expected to contain in 1879 of
   course it was much less ample than it is now; yet even then it was
   remarkable but that shocking thing from the primal cyclopean crypt on
   an ephemeral seaspawned island was always its chief attraction and
   most impenetrable mystery

   the mummy was that of a mediumsized man of unknown race and was cast
   in a peculiar crouching posture the face half shielded by clawlike
   hands had its under jaw thrust far forward while the shrivelled
   features bore an expression of fright so hideous that few spectators
   could view them unmoved the eyes were closed with lids clamped down
   tightly over eyeballs apparently bulging and prominent bits of hair
   and beard remained and the colour of the whole was a sort of dull
   neutral grey in texture the thing was half leathery and half stony
   forming an insoluble enigma to those experts who sought to ascertain
   how it was embalmed in places bits of its substance were eaten away by
   time and decay rags of some peculiar fabric with suggestions of
   unknown designs still clung to the object

   just what made it so infinitely horrible and repulsive one could hardly
   say for one thing there was a subtle indefinable sense of limitless
   antiquity and utter alienage which affected one like a view from the
   brink of a monstrous abyss of unplumbed blackness  but mostly it was
   the expression of crazed fear on the puckered prognathous
   halfshielded face such a symbol of infinite inhuman cosmic fright
   could not help communicating the emotion to the beholder amidst a
   disquieting cloud of mystery and vain conjecture

   among the discriminating few who frequented the cabot museum this relic
   of an elder forgotten world soon acquired an unholy fame though the
   institutions seclusion and quiet policy prevented it from becoming a
   popular sensation of the cardiff giant sort in the last century the
   art of vulgar ballyhoo had not invaded the field of scholarship to the
   extent it has now succeeded in doing naturally savants of various
   kinds tried their best to classify the frightful object though always
   without success theories of a bygone pacific civilisation of which
   the easter island images and the megalithic masonry of ponape and
   nanmatol are conceivable vestiges were freely circulated among
   students and learned journals carried varied and often conflicting
   speculations on a possible former continent whose peaks survive as the
   myriad islands of melanesia and polynesia the diversity in dates
   assigned to the hypothetical vanished culture  or continent  was at
   once bewildering and amusing; yet some surprisingly relevant allusions
   were found in certain myths of tahiti and other islands

   meanwhile the strange cylinder and its baffling scroll of unknown
   hieroglyphs carefully preserved in the museum library received their
   due share of attention no question could exist as to their association
   with the mummy; hence all realised that in the unravelling of their
   mystery the mystery of the shrivelled horror would in all probability
   be unravelled as well the cylinder about four inches long by
   seveneighths of an inch in diameter was of a queerly iridescent metal
   utterly defying chemical analysis and seemingly impervious to all
   reagents it was tightly fitted with a cap of the same substance and
   bore engraved figurings of an evidently decorative and possibly
   symbolic nature  conventional designs which seemed to follow a
   peculiarly alien paradoxical and doubtfully describable system of
   geometry

   not less mysterious was the scroll it contained  a neat roll of some
   thin bluishwhite unanalysable membrane coiled round a slim rod of
   metal like that of the cylinder and unwinding to a length of some two
   feet the large bold hieroglyphs extending in a narrow line down the
   centre of the scroll and penned or painted with a grey pigment defying
   analysts resembled nothing known to linguists and palaeographers and
   could not be deciphered despite the transmission of photographic copies
   to every living expert in the given field

   it is true that a few scholars unusually versed in the literature of
   occultism and magic found vague resemblances between some of the
   hieroglyphs and certain primal symbols described or cited in two or
   three very ancient obscure and esoteric texts such as the book of
   eibon reputed to descend from forgotten hyperborea; the pnakotic
   fragments alleged to be prehuman; and the monstrous and forbidden
   necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred none of these
   resemblances however was beyond dispute; and because of the
   prevailing low estimation of occult studies no effort was made to
   circulate copies of the hieroglyphs among mystical specialists had
   such circulation occurred at this early date the later history of the
   case might have been very different; indeed a glance at the
   hieroglyphs by any reader of von junzts horrible nameless cults would
   have established a linkage of unmistakable significance at this
   period however the readers of that monstrous blasphemy were
   exceedingly few; copies having been incredibly scarce in the interval
   between the suppression of the original dusseldorf edition (1839) and
   of the bridewell translation (1845) and the publication of the
   expurgated reprint by the golden goblin press in 1909 practically
   speaking no occultist or student of the primal pasts esoteric lore
   had his attention called to the strange scroll until the recent
   outburst of sensational journalism which precipitated the horrible
   climax

ii[edit]

   thus matters glided along for a halfcentury following the installation
   of the frightful mummy at the museum the gruesome object had a local
   celebrity among cultivated bostonians but no more than that; while the
   very existence of the cylinder and scroll  after a decade of futile
   research  was virtually forgotten so quiet and conservative was the
   cabot museum that no reporter or feature writer ever thought of
   invading its uneventful precincts for rabbletickling material

   the invasion of ballyhoo commenced in the spring of 1931 when a
   purchase of somewhat spectacular nature  that of the strange objects
   and inexplicably preserved bodies found in crypts beneath the almost
   vanished and evilly famous ruins of chateau faussesflammes in
   averoigne france  brought the museum prominently into the news
   columns true to its hustling policy the boston pillar sent a sunday
   feature writer to cover the incident and pad it with an exaggerated
   general account of the institution itself; and this young man  stuart
   reynolds by name  hit upon the nameless mummy as a potential sensation
   far surpassing the recent acquisitions nominally forming his chief
   assignment a smattering of theosophical lore and a fondness for the
   speculations of such writers as colonel churchward and lewis spence
   concerning lost continents and primal forgotten civilisations made
   reynolds especially alert toward any aeonian relic like the unknown
   mummy

   at the museum the reporter made himself a nuisance through constant and
   not always intelligent questionings and endless demands for the
   movement of encased objects to permit photographs from unusual angles
   in the basement library room he pored endlessly over the strange metal
   cylinder and its membraneous scroll photographing them from every
   angle and securing pictures of every bit of the weird hieroglyphed
   text he likewise asked to see all books with any bearing whatever on
   the subject of primal cultures and sunken continents  sitting for
   three hours taking notes and leaving only in order to hasten to
   cambridge for a sight (if permission were granted) of the abhorred and
   forbidden necronomicon at the widener library

   on april 5th the article appeared in the sunday pillar smothered in
   photographs of mummy cylinder and hieroglyphed scroll and couched in
   the peculiarly simpering infantile style which the pillar affects for
   the benefit of its vast and mentally immature clientele full of
   inaccuracies exaggerations and sensationalism it was precisely the
   sort of thing to stir the brainless and fickle interest of the herd 
   and as a result the once quiet museum began to be swarmed with
   chattering and vacuously staring throngs such as its stately corridors
   had never known before

   there were scholarly and intelligent visitors too despite the
   puerility of the article  the pictures had spoken for themselves  and
   many persons of mature attainments sometimes see the pillar by
   accident i recall one very strange character who appeared during
   november  a dark turbaned and bushily bearded man with a laboured
   unnatural voice curiously expressionless face clumsy hands covered
   with absurd white mittens who gave a squalid west end address and
   called himself swami chandraputra this fellow was unbelievably
   erudite in occult lore and seemed profoundly and solemnly moved by the
   resemblance of the hieroglyphs on the scroll to certain signs and
   symbols of a forgotten elder world about which he professed vast
   intuitive knowledge

   by june the fame of the mummy and scroll had leaked far beyond boston
   and the museum had inquiries and requests for photographs from
   occultists and students of arcana all over the world this was not
   altogether pleasing to our staff since we are a scientific institution
   without sympathy for fantastic dreamers; yet we answered all questions
   with civility one result of these catechisms was a highly learned
   article in the occult review by the famous new orleans mystic
   etiennelaurent de marigny in which was asserted the complete identity
   of some of the odd geometrical designs on the iridescent cylinder and
   of several of the hieroglyphs on the membraneous scroll with certain
   ideographs of horrible significance (transcribed from primal monoliths
   or from the secret rituals of hidden bands of esoteric students and
   devotees) reproduced in the hellish and suppressed black book or
   nameless cults of von junzt

   de marigny recalled the frightful death of von junzt in 1840 a year
   after the publication of his terrible volume at dusseldorf and
   commented on his bloodcurdling and partly suspected sources of
   information above all he emphasised the enormous relevance of the
   tales with which von junzt linked most of the monstrous ideographs he
   had reproduced that these tales in which a cylinder and scroll were
   expressly mentioned held a remarkable suggestion of relationship to
   the things at the museum no one could deny; yet they were of such
   breathtaking extravagance  involving such unbelievable sweeps of time
   and such fantastic anomalies of a forgotten elder world  that one
   could much more easily admire than believe them

   admire them the public certainly did for copying in the press was
   universal illustrated articles sprang up everywhere telling or
   purporting to tell the legends in the black book expatiating on the
   horror of the mummy comparing the cylinders designs and the scrolls
   hieroglyphs with the figures reproduced by von junzt and indulging in
   the wildest most sensational and most irrational theories and
   speculations attendance at the museum was trebled and the widespread
   nature of the interest was attested by the plethora of mail on the
   subject  most of it inane and superfluous  received at the museum
   apparently the mummy and its origin formed  for imaginative people  a
   close rival to the depression as chief topic of 1931 and 1932 for my
   own part the principal effect of the furore was to make me read von
   junzts monstrous volume in the golden goblin edition  a perusal which
   left me dizzy and nauseated yet thankful that i had not seen the utter
   infamy of the unexpurgated text

iii[edit]

   the archaic whispers reflected in the black book and linked with
   designs and symbols so closely akin to what the mysterious scroll and
   cylinder bore were indeed of a character to hold one spellbound and
   not a little awestruck leaping an incredible gulf of time  behind all
   the civilisations races and lands we know  they clustered round a
   vanished nation and a vanished continent of the misty fabulous
   dawnyears    that to which legend has given the name of mu and
   which old tablets in the primal naacal tongue speak of as flourishing
   200000 years ago when europe harboured only hybrid entities and lost
   hyperborea knew the nameless worship of black amorphous tsathoggua

   there was mention of a kingdom or province called knaa in a very
   ancient land where the first human people had found monstrous ruins
   left by those who had dwelt there before  vague waves of unknown
   entities which had filtered down from the stars and lived out their
   aeons on a forgotten nascent world knaa was a sacred place since
   from its midst the bleak basalt cliffs of mount yaddithgho soared
   starkly into the sky topped by a gigantic fortress of cyclopean stone
   infinitely older than mankind and built by the alien spawn of the dark
   planet yuggoth which had colonised the earth before the birth of
   terrestrial life

   the spawn of yuggoth had perished aeons before but had left behind
   them one monstrous and terrible living thing which could never die 
   their hellish god or patron daemon ghatanothoa which glowered and
   brooded eternally though unseen in the crypts beneath that fortress on
   yaddithgho no human creature had ever climbed yaddithgho or seen
   that blasphemous fortress except as a distant and geometrically
   abnormal outline against the sky; yet most agreed that ghatanothoa was
   still there wallowing and burrowing in unsuspected abysses beneath the
   megalithic walls there were always those who believed that sacrifices
   must be made to ghatanothoa lest it crawl out of its hidden abysses
   and waddle horribly through the world of men as it had once waddled
   through the primal world of the yuggothspawn

   people said that if no victims were offered ghatanothoa would ooze up
   to the light of day and lumber down the basalt cliffs of yaddithgho
   bringing doom to all it might encounter for no living thing could
   behold ghatanothoa or even a perfect graven image of ghatanothoa
   however small without suffering a change more horrible than death
   itself sight of the god or its image as all the legends of the
   yuggothspawn agreed meant paralysis and petrifaction of a singularly
   shocking sort in which the victim was turned to stone and leather on
   the outside while the brain within remained perpetually alive 
   horribly fixed and prisoned through the ages and maddeningly conscious
   of the passage of interminable epochs of helpless inaction till chance
   and time might complete the decay of the petrified shell and leave it
   exposed to die most brains of course would go mad long before this
   aeondeferred release could arrive no human eyes it was said had
   ever glimpsed ghatanothoa though the danger was as great now as it had
   been for the yuggothspawn

   and so there was a cult in knaa which worshipped ghatanothoa and each
   year sacrificed to it twelve young warriors and twelve young maidens
   these victims were offered up on flaming altars in the marble temple
   near the mountains base for none dared climb yaddithghos basalt
   cliffs or draw near to the cyclopean prehuman stronghold on its crest
   vast was the power of the priests of ghatanothoa since upon them alone
   depended the preservation of knaa and of all the land of mu from the
   petrifying emergence of ghatanothoa out of its unknown burrows

   there were in the land an hundred priests of the dark god under
   imashmo the highpriest who walked before king thabon at the
   nathfeast and stood proudly whilst the king knelt at the dhoric
   shrine each priest had a marble house a chest of gold two hundred
   slaves and an hundred concubines besides immunity from civil law and
   the power of life and death over all in knaa save the priests of the
   king yet in spite of these defenders there was ever a fear in the land
   lest ghatanothoa slither up from the depths and lurch viciously down
   the mountain to bring horror and petrification to mankind in the
   latter years the priests forbade men even to guess or imagine what its
   frightful aspect might be

   it was in the year of the red moon (estimated as bc 173148 by von
   junzt) that a human being first dared to breathe defiance against
   ghatanothoa and its nameless menace this bold heretic was tyog
   highpriest of shubniggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the
   goat with a thousand young tyog had thought long on the powers of the
   various gods and had had strange dreams and revelations touching the
   life of this and earlier worlds in the end he felt sure that the gods
   friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods and believed
   that shubniggurath nug and yeb as well as yig the serpentgod were
   ready to take sides with man against the tyranny and presumption of
   ghatanothoa

   inspired by the mother goddess tyog wrote down a strange formula in
   the hieratic naacal of his order which he believed would keep the
   possessor immune from the dark gods petrifying power with this
   protection he reflected it might be possible for a bold man to climb
   the dreaded basalt cliffs and  first of all human beings  enter the
   cyclopean fortress beneath which ghatanothoa reputedly brooded face to
   face with the god and with the power of shubniggurath and her sons on
   his side tyog believed that he might be able to bring it to terms and
   at last deliver mankind from its brooding menace with humanity freed
   through his efforts there would be no limits to the honours he might
   claim all the honours of the priests of ghatanothoa would perforce be
   transferred to him; and even kingship or godhood might conceivably be
   within his reach

   so tyog wrote his protective formula on a scroll of pthagon membrane
   (according to von junzt the inner skin of the extinct yakithlizard)
   and enclosed it in a carven cylinder of lagh metal  the metal brought
   by the elder ones from yuggoth and found in no mine of earth this
   charm carried in his robe would make him proof against the menace of
   ghatanothoa  it would even restore the dark gods petrified victims if
   that monstrous entity should ever emerge and begin its devastations
   thus he proposed to go up the shunned and manuntrodden mountain
   invade the alienangled citadel of cyclopean stone and confront the
   shocking devilentity in its lair of what would follow he could not
   even guess; but the hope of being mankinds saviour lent strength to
   his will

   he had however reckoned without the jealousy and selfinterest of
   ghatanothoas pampered priests no sooner did they hear of his plan
   than  fearful for their prestige and privilege in case the daemongod
   should be dethroned  they set up a frantic clamour against the
   socalled sacrilege crying that no man might prevail against
   ghatanothoa and that any effort to seek it out would merely provoke it
   to a hellish onslaught against mankind which no spell or priestcraft
   could hope to avert with those cries they hoped to turn the public
   mind against tyog; yet such was the peoples yearning for freedom from
   ghatanothoa and such their confidence in the skill and zeal of tyog
   that all the protestations came to naught even the king usually a
   puppet of the priests refused to forbid tyogs daring pilgrimage

   it was then that the priests of ghatanothoa did by stealth what they
   could not do openly one night imash mo the highpriest stole to
   tyog in his temple chamber and took from his sleeping form the metal
   cylinder; silently drawing out the potent scroll and putting in its
   place another scroll of great similitude yet varied enough to have no
   power against any god or daemon when the cylinder was slipped back
   into the sleepers cloak imashmo was content for he knew tyog was
   little likely to study that cylinders contents again thinking himself
   protected by the true scroll the heretic would march up the forbidden
   mountain and into the evil presence  and ghatanothoa unchecked by any
   magic would take care of the rest

   it would no longer be needful for ghatanothoas priests to preach
   against the defiance let tyog go his way and meet his doom and
   secretly the priests would always cherish the stolen scroll  the true
   and potent charm  handing it down from one highpriest to another for
   use in any dim future when it might be needful to contravene the
   devilgods will so the rest of the night imashmo slept in great
   peace with the true scroll in a new cylinder fashioned for its
   harbourage

   it was dawn on the day of the skyflames (nomenclature undefined by von
   junzt) that tyog amidst the prayers and chanting of the people and
   with king thabons blessing on his head started up the dreaded
   mountain with a staff of tlathwood in his right hand within his robe
   was the cylinder holding what he thought to be the true charm  for he
   had indeed failed to find out the imposture nor did he see any irony
   in the prayers which imashmo and the other priests of ghatanothoa
   intoned for his safety and success

   all that morning the people stood and watched as tyogs dwindling form
   struggled up the shunned basalt slope hitherto alien to mens
   footsteps and many stayed watching long after he had vanished where a
   perilous ledge led round to the mountains hidden side that night a
   few sensitive dreamers thought they heard a faint tremor convulsing the
   hated peak; though most ridiculed them for the statement next day vast
   crowds watched the mountain and prayed and wondered how soon tyog
   would return and so the next day and the next for weeks they hoped
   and waited and then they wept nor did anyone ever see tyog who
   would have saved mankind from fears again

   thereafter men shuddered at tyogs presumption and tried not to think
   of the punishment his impiety had met and the priests of ghatanothoa
   smiled to those who might resent the gods will or challenge its right
   to the sacrifices in later years the ruse of imashmo became known to
   the people; yet the knowledge availed not to change the general feeling
   that ghatanothoa were better left alone none ever dared to defy it
   again and so the ages rolled on and king succeeded king and
   highpriest succeeded highpriest and nations rose and decayed and
   lands rose above the sea and returned into the sea and with many
   millennia decay fell upon knaa  till at last on a hideous day of
   storm and thunder terrific rumbling and mountainhigh waves all the
   land of mu sank into the sea forever

   yet down the later aeons thin streams of ancient secrets trickled in
   distant lands there met together greyfaced fugitives who had survived
   the seafiends rage and strange skies drank the smoke of altars
   reared to vanished gods and daemons though none knew to what
   bottomless deep the sacred peak and cyclopean fortress of dreaded
   ghatanothoa had sunk there were still those who mumbled its name and
   offered to it nameless sacrifices lest it bubble up through leagues of
   ocean and shamble among men spreading horror and petrifaction

   around the scattered priests grew the rudiments of a dark and secret
   cult  secret because the people of the new lands had other gods and
   devils and thought only evil of elder and alien ones  and within that
   cult many hideous things were done and many strange objects cherished
   it was whispered that a certain line of elusive priests still harboured
   the true charm against ghatanothoa which imashmo stole from the
   sleeping tyog; though none remained who could read or understand the
   cryptic syllables or who could even guess in what part of the world
   the lost knaa the dreaded peak of yaddithgho and the titan fortress
   of the devilgod had lain

   though it flourished chiefly in those pacific regions around which mu
   itself had once stretched there were rumours of the hidden and
   detested cult of ghatanothoa in illfated atlantis and on the abhorred
   plateau of leng von junzt implied its presence in the fabled
   subterrene kingdom of knyan and gave clear evidence that it had
   penetrated egypt chaldaea persia china the forgotten semite empires
   of africa and mexico and peru in the new world that it had a strong
   connexion with the witchcraft movement in europe against which the
   bulls of popes were vainly directed he more than strongly hinted the
   west however was never favourable to its growth; and public
   indignation  aroused by glimpses of hideous rites and nameless
   sacrifices  wholly stamped out many of its branches in the end it
   became a hunted doubly furtive underground affair  yet never could
   its nucleus be quite exterminated it always survived somehow chiefly
   in the far east and on the pacific islands where its teachings became
   merged into the esoteric lore of the polynesian areoi

   von junzt gave subtle and disquieting hints of actual contact with the
   cult; so that as i read i shuddered at what was rumoured about his
   death he spoke of the growth of certain ideas regarding the appearance
   of the devilgod  a creature which no human being (unless it were the
   toodaring tyog who had never returned) had ever seen  and
   contrasted this habit of speculation with the taboo prevailing in
   ancient mu against any attempt to imagine what the horror looked like
   there was a peculiar fearfulness about the devotees awed and
   fascinated whispers on this subject  whispers heavy with morbid
   curiosity concerning the precise nature of what tyog might have
   confronted in that frightful prehuman edifice on the dreaded and
   nowsunken mountains before the end (if it was an end) finally came 
   and i felt oddly disturbed by the german scholars oblique and
   insidious references to this topic

   scarcely less disturbing were von junzts conjectures on the
   whereabouts of the stolen scroll of cantrips against ghatanothoa and
   on the ultimate uses to which this scroll might be put despite all my
   assurance that the whole matter was purely mythical i could not help
   shivering at the notion of a latterday emergence of the monstrous god
   and at the picture of an humanity turned suddenly to a race of abnormal
   statues each encasing a living brain doomed to inert and helpless
   consciousness for untold aeons of futurity the old dusseldorf savant
   had a poisonous way of suggesting more than he stated and i could
   understand why his damnable book was suppressed in so many countries as
   blasphemous dangerous and unclean

   i writhed with repulsion yet the thing exerted an unholy fascination;
   and i could not lay it down till i had finished it the alleged
   reproductions of designs and ideographs from mu were marvellously and
   startlingly like the markings on the strange cylinder and the
   characters on the scroll and the whole account teemed with details
   having vague irritating suggestions of resemblance to things connected
   with the hideous mummy the cylinder and scroll  the pacific setting 
   the persistent notion of old capt weatherbee that the cyclopean crypt
   where the mummy was found had once lain under a vast building   
   somehow i was vaguely glad that the volcanic island had sunk before
   that massive suggestion of a trapdoor could be opened

iv[edit]

   what i read in the black book formed a fiendishly apt preparation for
   the news items and closer events which began to force themselves upon
   me in the spring of 1932 i can scarcely recall just when the
   increasingly frequent reports of police action against the odd and
   fantastical religious cults in the orient and elsewhere commenced to
   impress me; but by may or june i realised that there was all over the
   world a surprising and unwonted burst of activity on the part of
   bizarre furtive and esoteric mystical organisations ordinarily
   quiescent and seldom heard from

   it is not likely that i would have connected these reports with either
   the hints of von junzt or the popular furore over the mummy and
   cylinder in the museum but for certain significant syllables and
   persistent resemblances  sensationally dwelt upon by the press  in
   the rites and speeches of the various secret celebrants brought to
   public attention as it was i could not help remarking with disquiet
   the frequent recurrence of a name  in various corrupt forms  which
   seemed to constitute a focal point of all the cult worship and which
   was obviously regarded with a singular mixture of reverence and terror
   some of the forms quoted were gtanta tanotah thantha gatan and
   ktantah  and it did not require the suggestions of my now numerous
   occultist correspondents to make me see in these variants a hideous and
   suggestive kinship to the monstrous name rendered by von junzt as
   ghatanothoa

   there were other disquieting features too again and again the reports
   cited vague awestruck references to a true scroll  something on
   which tremendous consequences seemed to hinge and which was mentioned
   as being in the custody of a certain nagob whoever and whatever he
   might be likewise there was an insistent repetition of a name which
   sounded like tog tiok yog zob or yob and which my more and more
   excited consciousness involuntarily linked with the name of the hapless
   heretic tyog as given in the black book this name was usually uttered
   in connexion with such cryptical phrases as it is none other than he
   he had looked upon its face he knows all though he can neither see
   nor feel he has brought the memory down through the aeons the
   true scroll will release him nagob has the true scroll he can
   tell where to find it

   something very queer was undoubtedly in the air and i did not wonder
   when my occultist correspondents as well as the sensational sunday
   papers began to connect the new abnormal stirrings with the legends of
   mu on the one hand and with the frightful mummys recent exploitation
   on the other hand the widespread articles in the first wave of press
   publicity with their insistent linkage of the mummy cylinder and
   scroll with the tale in the black book and their crazily fantastic
   speculations about the whole matter might very well have roused the
   latent fanaticism in hundreds of those furtive groups of exotic
   devotees with which our complex world abounds nor did the papers cease
   adding fuel to the flames  for the stories on the cultstirrings were
   even wilder than the earlier series of yarns

   as the summer drew on attendants noticed a curious new element among
   the throngs of visitors which  after a lull following the first burst
   of publicity  were again drawn to the museum by the second furore
   more and more frequently there were persons of strange and exotic
   aspect  swarthy asiatics longhaired nondescripts and bearded brown
   men who seemed unused to european clothes  who would invariably
   inquire for the hall of mummies and would subsequently be found staring
   at the hideous pacific specimen in a veritable ecstasy of fascination
   some quiet sinister undercurrent in this flood of eccentric foreigners
   seemed to impress all the guards and i myself was far from
   undisturbed i could not help thinking of the prevailing cultstirrings
   among just such exotics as these  and the connexion of those stirrings
   with myths all too close to the frightful mummy and its cylinder
   scroll

   at times i was half tempted to withdraw the mummy from exhibition 
   especially when an attendant told me that he had several times glimpsed
   strangers making odd obeisances before it and had overheard singsong
   mutterings which sounded like chants or rituals addressed to it at
   hours when the visiting throngs were somewhat thinned one of the
   guards acquired a queer nervous hallucination about the petrified
   horror in the lone glass case alleging that he could see from day to
   day certain vague subtle and infinitely slight changes in the frantic
   flexion of the bony claws and in the fearcrazed expression of the
   leathery face he could not get rid of the loathsome idea that those
   horrible bulging eyes were about to pop suddenly open

   it was early in september when the curious crowds had lessened and the
   hall of mummies was sometimes vacant that the attempt to get at the
   mummy by cutting the glass of its case was made the culprit a swarthy
   polynesian was spied in time by a guard and was overpowered before
   any damage occurred upon investigation the fellow turned out to be an
   hawaiian notorious for his activity in certain underground religious
   cults and having a considerable police record in connexion with
   abnormal and inhuman rites and sacrifices some of the papers found in
   his room were highly puzzling and disturbing including many sheets
   covered with hieroglyphs closely resembling those on the scroll at the
   museum and in the black book of von junzt; but regarding these things
   he could not be prevailed upon to speak

   scarcely a week after this incident another attempt to get at the
   mummy  this time by tampering with the lock of his case  resulted in
   a second arrest the offender a cingalese had as long and unsavoury a
   record of loathsome cult activities as the hawaiian had possessed and
   displayed a kindred unwillingness to talk to the police what made this
   case doubly and darkly interesting was that a guard had noticed this
   man several times before and had heard him addressing to the mummy a
   peculiar chant containing unmistakable repetitions of the word tyog
   as a result of this affair i doubled the guards in the hall of mummies
   and ordered them never to leave the now notorious specimen out of
   sight even for a moment

   as may well be imagined the press made much of these two incidents
   reviewing its talk of primal and fabulous mu and claiming boldly that
   the hideous mummy was none other than the daring heretic tyog
   petrified by something he had seen in the prehuman citadel he had
   invaded and preserved intact through 175000 years of our planets
   turbulent history that the strange devotees represented cults
   descended from mu and that they were worshipping the mummy  or
   perhaps even seeking to awaken it to life by spells and incantations 
   was emphasised and reiterated in the most sensational fashion

   writers exploited the insistence of the old legends that the brain of
   ghatanothoas petrified victims remained conscious and unaffected  a
   point which served as a basis for the wildest and most improbable
   speculations the mention of a true scroll also received due
   attention  it being the prevailing popular theory that tyogs stolen
   charm against ghatanothoa was somewhere in existence and that
   cultmembers were trying to bring it into contact with tyog himself
   for some purpose of their own one result of this exploitation was that
   a third wave of gaping visitors began flooding the museum and staring
   at the hellish mummy which served as a nucleus for the whole strange
   and disturbing affair

   it was among this wave of spectators  many of whom made repeated
   visits  that talk of the mummys vaguely changing aspect first began
   to be widespread i suppose  despite the disturbing notion of the
   nervous guard some months before  that the museums personnel was too
   well used to the constant sight of odd shapes to pay close attention to
   details; in any case it was the excited whispers of visitors which at
   length aroused the guards to the subtle mutation which was apparently
   in progress almost simultaneously the press got hold of it  with
   blatant results which can well be imagined

   naturally i gave the matter my most careful observation and by the
   middle of october decided that a definite disintegration of the mummy
   was under way through some chemical or physical influence in the air
   the halfstony halfleathery fibres seemed to be gradually relaxing
   causing distinct variations in the angles of the limbs and in certain
   details of the feartwisted facial expression after a halfcentury of
   perfect preservation this was a highly disconcerting development and i
   had the museums taxidermist dr moore go carefully over the gruesome
   object several times he reported a general relaxation and softening
   and gave the thing two or three astringent sprayings but did not dare
   to attempt anything drastic lest there be a sudden crumbling and
   accelerated decay

   the effect of all this upon the gaping crowds was curious heretofore
   each new sensation sprung by the press had brought fresh waves of
   staring and whispering visitors but now  though the papers blathered
   endlessly about the mummys changes  the public seemed to have
   acquired a definite sense of fear which outranked even its morbid
   curiosity people seemed to feel that a sinister aura hovered over the
   museum and from a high peak the attendance fell to a level distinctly
   below normal this lessened attendance gave added prominence to the
   stream of freakish foreigners who continued to infest the place and
   whose numbers seemed in no way diminished

   on november 18th a peruvian of indian blood suffered a strange
   hysterical or epileptic seizure in front of the mummy afterward
   shrieking from his hospital cot it tried to open its eyes!  tyog
   tried to open his eyes and stare at me! i was by this time on the
   point of removing the object from exhibition but permitted myself to
   be overruled at a meeting of our very conservative directors however
   i could see that the museum was beginning to acquire an unholy
   reputation in its austere and quiet neighbourhood after this incident
   i gave instructions that no one be allowed to pause before the
   monstrous pacific relic for more than a few minutes at a time

   it was on november 24th after the museums five oclock closing that
   one of the guards noticed a minute opening of the mummys eyes the
   phenomenon was very slight  nothing but a thin crescent of cornea
   being visible in either eye  but it was none the less of the highest
   interest dr moore having been summoned hastily was about to study
   the exposed bits of eyeball with a magnifier when his handling of the
   mummy caused the leathery lids to fall tightly shut again all gentle
   efforts to open them failed and the taxidermist did not dare to apply
   drastic measures when he notified me of all this by telephone i felt a
   sense of mounting dread hard to reconcile with the apparently simple
   event concerned for a moment i could share the popular impression that
   some evil amorphous blight from unplumbed deeps of time and space hung
   murkily and menacingly over the museum

   two nights later a sullen filipino was trying to secrete himself in the
   museum at closing time arrested and taken to the station he refused
   even to give his name and was detained as a suspicious person
   meanwhile the strict surveillance of the mummy seemed to discourage the
   odd hordes of foreigners from haunting it at least the number of
   exotic visitors distinctly fell off after the enforcement of the move
   along order

   it was during the early morning hours of thursday december 1st that a
   terrible climax developed at about one oclock horrible screams of
   mortal fright and agony were heard issuing from the museum and a
   series of frantic telephone calls from neighbours brought to the scene
   quickly and simultaneously a squad of police and several museum
   officials including myself some of the policemen surrounded the
   building while others with the officials cautiously entered in the
   main corridor we found the night watchman strangled to death  a bit of
   east indian hemp still knotted around his neck  and realised that
   despite all precautions some darkly evil intruder or intruders had
   gained access to the place now however a tomblike silence enfolded
   everything and we almost feared to advance upstairs to the fateful wing
   where we knew the core of the trouble must lurk we felt a bit more
   steadied after flooding the building with light from the central
   switches in the corridor and finally crept reluctantly up the curving
   staircase and through a lofty archway to the hall of mummies

v[edit]

   it is from this point onward that reports of the hideous case have been
   censored  for we have all agreed that no good can be accomplished by a
   public knowledge of those terrestrial conditions implied by the further
   developments i have said that we flooded the whole building with light
   before our ascent now beneath the beams that beat down on the
   glistening cases and their gruesome contents we saw outspread a mute
   horror whose baffling details testified to happenings utterly beyond
   our comprehension there were two intruders  who we afterward agreed
   must have hidden in the building before closing time  but they would
   never be executed for the watchmans murder they had already paid the
   penalty

   one was a burmese and the other a fijiislander  both known to the
   police for their share in frightful and repulsive cult activities they
   were dead and the more we examined them the more utterly monstrous and
   unnamable we felt their manner of death to be on both faces was a more
   wholly frantic and inhuman look of fright than even the oldest
   policeman had ever seen before; yet in the state of the two bodies
   there were vast and significant differences

   the burmese lay collapsed close to the nameless mummys case from
   which a square of glass had been neatly cut in his right hand was a
   scroll of bluish membrane which i at once saw was covered with greyish
   hieroglyphs  almost a duplicate of the scroll in the strange cylinder
   in the library downstairs though later study brought out subtle
   differences there was no mark of violence on the body and in view of
   the desperate agonised expression on the twisted face we could only
   conclude that the man died of sheer fright

   it was the closely adjacent fijian though that gave us the
   profoundest shock one of the policemen was the first to feel of him
   and the cry of fright he emitted added another shudder to that
   neighbourhoods night of terror we ought to have known from the lethal
   greyness of the onceblack feartwisted face and of the bony hands 
   one of which still clutched an electric torch  that something was
   hideously wrong; yet every one of us was unprepared for what that
   officers hesitant touch disclosed even now i can think of it only
   with a paroxysm of dread and repulsion to be brief  the hapless
   invader who less than an hour before had been a sturdy living
   melanesian bent on unknown evils was now a rigid ashgrey figure of
   stony leathery petrification in every respect identical with the
   crouching aeonold blasphemy in the violated glass case

   yet that was not the worst crowning all other horrors and indeed
   seizing our shocked attention before we turned to the bodies on the
   floor was the state of the frightful mummy no longer could its
   changes be called vague and subtle for it had now made radical shifts
   of posture it had sagged and slumped with a curious loss of rigidity;
   its bony claws had sunk until they no longer even partly covered its
   leathery fearcrazed face; and  god help us!  its hellish bulging
   eyes had popped wide open and seemed to be staring directly at the two
   intruders who had died of fright or worse

   that ghastly deadfish stare was hideously mesmerising and it haunted
   us all the time we were examining the bodies of the invaders its
   effect on our nerves was damnably queer for we somehow felt a curious
   rigidity creeping over us and hampering our simplest motions  a
   rigidity which later vanished very oddly when we passed the
   hieroglyphed scroll around for inspection every now and then i felt my
   gaze drawn irresistibly toward those horrible bulging eyes in the case
   and when i returned to study them after viewing the bodies i thought i
   detected something very singular about the glassy surface of the dark
   and marvellously wellpreserved pupils the more i looked the more
   fascinated i became; and at last i went down to the office  despite
   that strange stiffness in my limbs  and brought up a strong multiple
   magnifying glass with this i commenced a very close and careful survey
   of the fishy pupils while the others crowded expectantly around

   i had always been rather sceptical of the theory that scenes and
   objects become photographed on the retina of the eye in cases of death
   or coma; yet no sooner did i look through the lens than i realised the
   presence of some sort of image other than the rooms reflection in the
   glassy bulging optics of this nameless spawn of the aeons certainly
   there was a dimly outlined scene on the ageold retinal surface and i
   could not doubt that it formed the last thing on which those eyes had
   looked in life  countless millennia ago it seemed to be steadily
   fading and i fumbled with the magnifier in order to shift another lens
   into place yet it must have been accurate and clearcut; even if
   infinitesimally small when  in response to some evil spell or act
   connected with their visit  it had confronted those intruders who were
   frightened to death with the extra lens i could make out many details
   formerly invisible and the awed group around me hung on the flood of
   words with which i tried to tell what i saw

   for here in the year 1932 a man in the city of boston was looking on
   something which belonged to an unknown and utterly alien world  a
   world that vanished from existence and normal memory aeons ago there
   was a vast room  a chamber of cyclopean masonry  and i seemed to be
   viewing it from one of its corners on the walls were carvings so
   hideous that even in this imperfect image their stark blasphemousness
   and bestiality sickened me i could not believe that the carvers of
   these things were human or that they had ever seen human beings when
   they shaped the frightful outlines which leered at the beholder in the
   centre of the chamber was a colossal trapdoor of stone pushed upward
   to permit the emergence of some object from below the object should
   have been clearly visible  indeed must have been when the eyes first
   opened before the fearstricken intruders  though under my lenses it
   was merely a monstrous blur

   as it happened i was studying the right eye only when i brought the
   extra magnification into play a moment later i wished fervently that
   my search had ended there as it was however the zeal of discovery
   and revelation was upon me and i shifted my powerful lenses to the
   mummys left eye in the hope of finding the image less faded on that
   retina my hands trembling with excitement and unnaturally stiff from
   some obscure influence were slow in bringing the magnifier into focus
   but a moment later i realised that the image was less faded than in the
   other eye i saw in a morbid flash of halfdistinctness the
   insufferable thing which was welling up through the prodigious
   trapdoor in that cyclopean immemorially archaic crypt of a lost world
    and fell fainting with an inarticulate shriek of which i am not even
   ashamed

   by the time i revived there was no distinct image of anything in either
   eye of the monstrous mummy sergeant keefe of the police looked with my
   glass for i could not bring myself to face that abnormal entity again
   and i thanked all the powers of the cosmos that i had not looked
   earlier than i did it took all my resolution and a great deal of
   solicitation to make me relate what i had glimpsed in the hideous
   moment of revelation indeed i could not speak till we had all
   adjourned to the office below out of sight of that daemoniac thing
   which could not be for i had begun to harbour the most terrible and
   fantastic notions about the mummy and its glassy bulging eyes  that
   it had a kind of hellish consciousness seeing all that occurred before
   it and trying vainly to communicate some frightful message from the
   gulfs of time that meant madness  but at last i thought i might be
   better off if i told what i had half seen

   after all it was not a long thing to tell oozing and surging up out
   of that yawning trapdoor in the cyclopean crypt i had glimpsed such an
   unbelievable behemothic monstrosity that i could not doubt the power of
   its original to kill with its mere sight even now i cannot begin to
   suggest it with any words at my command i might call it gigantic 
   tentacled  proboscidian  octopuseyed  semiamorphous  plastic 
   partly squamous and partly rugose  ugh! but nothing i could say could
   even adumbrate the loathsome unholy nonhuman extragalactic horror
   and hatefulness and unutterable evil of that forbidden spawn of black
   chaos and illimitable night as i write these words the associated
   mental image causes me to lean back faint and nauseated as i told of
   the sight to the men around me in the office i had to fight to
   preserve the consciousness i had regained

   nor were my hearers much less moved not a man spoke above a whisper
   for a full quarterhour and there were awed halffurtive references
   to the frightful lore in the black book to the recent newspaper tales
   of cultstirrings and to the sinister events in the museum
   ghatanothoa    even its smallest perfect image could petrify  tyog
    the false scroll  he never came back  the true scroll which could
   fully or partly undo the petrification  did it survive?  the hellish
   cults  the phrases overheard  it is none other than he  he had
   looked upon its face  he knows all though he can neither see nor
   feel  he had brought the memory down through the aeons  the true
   scroll will release him  nagob has the true scroll  he can tell
   where to find it only the healing greyness of the dawn brought us
   back to sanity; a sanity which made of that glimpse of mine a closed
   topic  something not to be explained or thought of again

   we gave out only partial reports to the press and later on cooperated
   with the papers in making other suppressions for example when the
   autopsy shewed the brain and several other internal organs of the
   petrified fijian to be fresh and unpetrified though hermetically
   sealed by the petrification of the exterior flesh  an anomaly about
   which physicians are still guardedly and bewilderedly debating  we did
   not wish a furore to be started we knew too well what the yellow
   journals remembering what was said of the intactbrained and
   stillconscious state of ghatanothoas stonyleathery victims would
   make of this detail

   as matters stood they pointed out that the man who had held the
   hieroglyphed scroll  and who had evidently thrust it at the mummy
   through the opening in the case  was not petrified while the man who
   had not held it was when they demanded that we make certain
   experiments  applying the scroll both to the stonyleathery body of
   the fijian and to the mummy itself  we indignantly refused to abet
   such superstitious notions of course the mummy was withdrawn from
   public view and transferred to the museum laboratory awaiting a really
   scientific examination before some suitable medical authority
   remembering past events we kept it under a strict guard; but even so
   an attempt was made to enter the museum at 2:25 am on december 5th
   prompt working of the burglar alarm frustrated the design though
   unfortunately the criminal or criminals escaped

   that no hint of anything further ever reached the public i am
   profoundly thankful i wish devoutly that there were nothing more to
   tell there will of course be leaks and if anything happens to me i
   do not know what my executors will do with this manuscript; but at
   least the case will not be painfully fresh in the multitudes memory
   when the revelation comes besides no one will believe the facts when
   they are finally told that is the curious thing about the multitude
   when their yellow press makes hints they are ready to swallow
   anything; but when a stupendous and abnormal revelation is actually
   made they laugh it aside as a lie for the sake of general sanity it
   is probably better so

   i have said that a scientific examination of the frightful mummy was
   planned this took place on december 8th exactly a week after the
   hideous culmination of events and was conducted by the eminent dr
   william minot in conjunction with wentworth moore scd taxidermist
   of the museum dr minot had witnessed the autopsy of the oddly
   petrified fijian the week before there were also present messrs
   lawrence cabot and dudley saltonstall of the museums trustees drs
   mason wells and carver of the museum staff two representatives of
   the press and myself during the week the condition of the hideous
   specimen had not visibly changed though some relaxation of its fibres
   caused the position of the glassy open eyes to shift slightly from
   time to time all of the staff dreaded to look at the thing  for its
   suggestion of quiet conscious watching had become intolerable  and it
   was only with an effort that i could bring myself to attend the
   examination

   dr minot arrived shortly after 1:00 pm and within a few minutes
   began his survey of the mummy considerable disintegration took place
   under his hands and in view of this  and of what we told him
   concerning the gradual relaxation of the specimen since the first of
   october  he decided that a thorough dissection ought to be made before
   the substance was further impaired the proper instruments being
   present in the laboratory equipment he began at once; exclaiming aloud
   at the odd fibrous nature of the grey mummified substance

   but his exclamation was still louder when he made the first deep
   incision for out of that cut there slowly trickled a thick crimson
   stream whose nature  despite the infinite ages dividing this hellish
   mummys lifetime from the present  was utterly unmistakable a few
   more deft strokes revealed various organs in astonishing degrees of
   nonpetrified preservation  all indeed being intact except where
   injuries to the petrified exterior had brought about malformation or
   destruction the resemblance of this condition to that found in the
   frightkilled fijiislander was so strong that the eminent physician
   gasped in bewilderment the perfection of those ghastly bulging eyes
   was uncanny and their exact state with respect to petrification was
   very difficult to determine

   at 3:30 pm the braincase was opened  and ten minutes later our
   stunned group took an oath of secrecy which only such guarded documents
   as this manuscript will ever modify even the two reporters were glad
   to confirm the silence for the opening had revealed a pulsing living
   brain

   we are the valiant knights of peace
   who prattle for the right:
   our banner is of snowy fleece
   inscribd: too proud to fight!

   by sweet chautauquas flowry banks
   we love to sing and play
   but should we spy a foemans ranks!
   wed proudly run away!

   when prussian fury sweeps the main
   our freedom to deny;
   of tyrant laws we neer complain;
   but gladsomely comply!

   we do not fear the submarines
   that plough the troubled foam;
   we scorn the ugly old machines 
   and safely stay at home!

   they say our countrys close to war
   and soon must man the guns;
   but we see naught to struggle for 
   we love the gentle huns!

   what though their hireling greaser bands
   invade our southern plains?
   we well can spare those boistrous lands
   content with what remains!

   our fathers were both rude and bold
   and would not live like brothers;
   but we are of a finer mould 
   were much more like our mothers!

   you neednt think im crazy eliot  plenty of others have queerer
   prejudices than this why dont you laugh at olivers grandfather who
   wont ride in a motor? if i dont like that damned subway its my own
   business; and we got here more quickly anyhow in the taxi wed have
   had to walk up the hill from park street if wed taken the car
         i know im more nervous than i was when you saw me last year but
   you dont need to hold a clinic over it theres plenty of reason god
   knows and i fancy im lucky to be sane at all why the third degree?
   you didnt use to be so inquisitive
         well if you must hear it i dont know why you shouldnt maybe
   you ought to anyhow for you kept writing me like a grieved parent
   when you heard id begun to cut the art club and keep away from
   pickman now that hes disappeared i go round to the club once in a
   while but my nerves arent what they were
         no i dont know whats become of pickman and i dont like to
   guess you might have surmised i had some inside information when i
   dropped him  and thats why i dont want to think where hes gone
   let the police find what they can  it wont be much judging from the
   fact that they dont know yet of the old north end place he hired under
   the name of peters
         im not sure that i could find it again myself  not that id
   ever try even in broad daylight!
         yes i do know or am afraid i know why he maintained it im
   coming to that and i think youll understand before im through why i
   dont tell the police they would ask me to guide them but i couldnt
   go back there even if i knew the way there was something there  and
   now i cant use the subway or (and you may as well have your laugh at
   this too) go down into cellars any more
         i should think youd have known i didnt drop pickman for the
   same silly reasons that fussy old women like dr reid or joe minot or
   rosworth did morbid art doesnt shock me and when a man has the
   genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him no matter what
   direction his work takes boston never had a greater painter than
   richard upton pickman i said it at first and i say it still and i
   never swerved an inch either when he showed that ghoul feeding
   that you remember was when minot cut him
         you know it takes profound art and profound insight into nature
   to turn out stuff like pickmans any magazinecover hack can splash
   paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a witches sabbath or a
   portrait of the devil but only a great painter can make such a thing
   really scare or ring true thats because only a real artist knows the
   actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear  the exact
   sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or
   hereditary memories of fright and the proper colour contrasts and
   lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness i dont have
   to tell you why a fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap
   ghoststory frontispiece merely makes us laugh theres something those
   fellows catch  beyond life  that theyre able to make us catch for
   a second doré had it sime has it angarola of chicago has it and
   pickman had it as no man ever had it before or  i hope to heaven 
   ever will again
         dont ask me what it is they see you know in ordinary art
   theres all the difference in the world between the vital breathing
   things drawn from nature or models and the artificial truck that
   commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule well i should
   say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes
   models or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral
   world he lives in anyhow he manages to turn out results that differ
   from the pretenders mincepie dreams in just about the same way that
   the life painters results differ from the concoctions of a
   correspondenceschool cartoonist if i had ever seen what pickman saw
    but no! here lets have a drink before we get any deeper god i
   wouldnt be alive if id ever seen what that man  if he was a man 
   saw !
         you recall that pickmans forte was faces i dont believe
   anybody since goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of
   features or a twist of expression and before goya you have to go back
   to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on notre
   dame and mont saintmichel they believed all sorts of things  and
   maybe they saw all sorts of things too for the middle ages had some
   curious phases i remember your asking pickman yourself once the year
   before you went away wherever in thunder he got such ideas and
   visions wasnt that a nasty laugh he gave you? it was partly because
   of that laugh that reid dropped him reid you know had just taken up
   comparative pathology and was full of pompous inside stuff about the
   biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or
   physical symptom he said pickman repelled him more and more every day
   and almost frightened him towards the last  that the fellows
   features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didnt like;
   in a way that wasnt human he had a lot of talk about diet and mid
   pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree i suppose
   you told reid if you and he had any correspondence over it that hed
   let pickmans paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination
   i know i told him that myself  then
         but keep in mind that i didnt drop pickman for anything like
   this on the contrary my admiration for him kept growing; for that
   ghoul feeding was a tremendous achievement as you know the club
   wouldnt exhibit it and the museum of fine arts wouldnt accept it as
   a gift; and i can add that nobody would buy it so pickman had it right
   in his house till he went now his father has it in salem  you know
   pickman comes of old salem stock and had a witch ancestor hanged in
   1692
         i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often
   especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art
   probably it was his work which put the idea into my head and anyhow i
   found him a mine of data and suggestions when i came to develop it he
   showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about; including some
   penandink sketches that would i verily believe have got him kicked
   out of the club if many of the members had seen them before long i was
   pretty nearly a devotee and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to
   art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him
   for the danvers asylum my heroworship coupled with the fact that
   people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him
   made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that
   if i were fairly closemouthed and none too squeamish he might show me
   something rather unusual  something a bit stronger than anything he
   had in the house
         you know he said there are things that wont do for newbury
   street  things that are out of place here and that cant be
   conceived here anyhow its my business to catch the overtones of the
   soul and you wont find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets
   on made land back bay isnt boston  it isnt anything yet because
   its had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits if
   there are any ghosts here theyre the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and
   a shallow cove; and i want human ghosts  the ghosts of beings highly
   organized enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what
   they saw
         the place for an artist to live is the north end if any
   aesthete were sincere hed put up with the slums for the sake of the
   massed traditions god man! dont you realize that places like that
   werent merely made but actually grew? generation after generation
   lived and felt and died there and in days when people werent afraid
   to live and feel and die dont you know there was a mill on copps
   hill in 1632 and that half the present streets were laid out by 1650?
   i can show you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and
   more; houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble
   into powder what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it? you
   call the salem witchcraft a delusion but ill wager my
   fourtimesgreatgrandmother could have told you things they hanged
   her on gallows hill with cotton mather looking sanctimoniously on
   mather damn him was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of
   this accursed cage of monotony  i wish someone had laid a spell on
   him or sucked his blood in the night!
         i can show you a house he lived in and i can show you another
   one he was afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk he knew
   things he didnt dare put into that stupid magnalia or that puerile
   wonders of the invisible world look here do you know the whole north
   end once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with
   each others houses and the burying ground and the sea? let them
   prosecute and persecute above ground  things went on every day that
   they couldnt reach and voices laughed at night that they couldnt
   place!
         why man out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not
   moved since ill wager that in eight i can show you something queer in
   the cellar theres hardly a month that you dont read of workmen
   finding brickedup arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old
   place as it comes down  you could see one near henchman street from
   the elevated last year there were witches and what their spells
   summoned; pirates and what they brought in from the sea; smugglers;
   privateers  and i tell you people knew how to live and how to
   enlarge the bounds of life in the old time! this wasnt the only world
   a bold and wise man could know  faugh! and to think of today in
   contrast with such palepink brains that even a club of supposed
   artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the
   feelings of a beacon street teatable!
         the only saving grace of the present is that its too damned
   stupid to question the past very closely what do maps and records and
   guidebooks really tell of the north end? bah! at a guess ill
   guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys
   north of prince street that arent suspected by ten living beings
   outside of the foreigners that swarm them and what do those dagoes
   know of their meaning? no thurber these ancient places are dreaming
   gorgeously and overflowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the
   commonplace and yet theres not a living soul to understand or profit
   by them or rather theres only one living soul  for i havent been
   digging around in the past for nothing!
         see here youre interested in this sort of thing what if i
   told you that ive got another studio up there where i can catch the
   nightspirit of antique horror and paint things that i couldnt even
   think of in newbury street? naturally i dont tell those cursed old
   maids at the club  with reid damn him whispering even as it is that
   im a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution
   yes thurber i decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as
   beauty from life so i did some exploring in places where i had reason
   to know terror lives
         ive got a place that i dont believe three living nordic men
   besides myself have ever seen it isnt so very far from the elevated
   as distance goes but its centuries away as the soul goes i took it
   because of the queer old brick well in the cellar  one of the sort i
   told you about the shacks almost tumbling down so that nobody else
   would live there and id hate to tell you how little i pay for it the
   windows are boarded up but i like that all the better since i dont
   want daylight for what i do i paint in the cellar where the
   inspiration is thickest but ive other rooms furnished on the ground
   floor a sicilian owns it and ive hired it under the name of peters
         now if youre game ill take you there tonight i think youd
   enjoy the pictures for as i said ive let myself go a bit there
   its no vast tour  i sometimes do it on foot for i dont want to
   attract attention with a taxi in such a place we can take the shuttle
   at the south station for battery street and after that the walk isnt
   much
         well eliot there wasnt much for me to do after that harangue
   but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant
   cab we could sight we changed to the elevated at the south station
   and at about twelve oclock had climbed down the steps at battery
   street and struck along the old waterfront past constitution wharf i
   didnt keep track of the cross streets and cant tell you yet which it
   was we turned up but i know it wasnt greenough lane
         when we did turn it was to climb through the deserted length of
   the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life with
   crumblinglooking gables broken smallpaned windows and archaic
   chimneys that stood out halfdisintegrated against the moonlit sky i
   dont believe there were three houses in sight that hadnt been
   standing in cotton mathers time  certainly i glimpsed at least two
   with an overhang and once i thought i saw a peaked roofline of the
   almost forgotten pregambrel type though antiquarians tell us there
   are none left in boston
         from that alley which had a dim light we turned to the left
   into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all:
   and in a minute made what i think was an obtuseangled bend towards the
   right in the dark not long after this pickman produced a flashlight
   and revealed an antediluvian tenpanelled door that looked damnably
   wormeaten unlocking it he ushered me into a barren hallway with what
   was once splendid darkoak panelling  simple of course but
   thrillingly suggestive of the times of andros and phipps and the
   witchcraft then he took me through a door on the left lighted an oil
   lamp and told me to make myself at home
         now eliot im what the man in the street would call fairly
   hardboiled but ill confess that what i saw on the walls of that
   room gave me a bad turn they were his pictures you know  the ones
   he couldnt paint or even show in newbury street  and he was right
   when he said he had let himself go here  have another drink  i
   need one anyhow!
         theres no use in my trying to tell you what they were like
   because the awful the blasphemous horror and the unbelievable
   loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond
   the power of words to classify there was none of the exotic technique
   you see in sidney sime none of the transsaturnian landscapes and
   lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood the
   backgrounds were mostly old churchyards deep woods cliffs by the sea
   brick tunnels ancient panelled rooms or simple vaults of masonry
   copps hill burying ground which could not be many blocks away from
   this very house was a favourite scene
         the madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground
    for pickmans morbid art was preeminently one of demoniac
   portraiture these figures were seldom completely human but often
   approached humanity in varying degree most of the bodies while
   roughly bipedal had a forward slumping and a vaguely canine cast the
   texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness ugh! i
   can see them now! their occupations  well dont ask me to be too
   precise they were usually feeding  i wont say on what they were
   sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages and
   often appeared to be in battle over their prey  or rather their
   treasuretrove and what damnable expressiveness pickman sometimes gave
   the sightless faces of this charnel booty! occasionally the things were
   shown leaping through open windows at night or squatting on the chests
   of sleepers worrying at their throats one canvas showed a ring of
   them baying about a hanged witch on gallows hill whose dead face held
   a close kinship to theirs
         but dont get the idea that it was all this hideous business of
   theme and setting which struck me faint im not a threeyearold kid
   and id seen much like this before it was the faces eliot those
   accursed faces that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the
   very breath of life! by god man i verily believe they were alive!
   that nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment and his
   brush had been a nightmarespawning wand give me that decanter eliot!
         there was one thing called the lesson  heaven pity me that i
   ever saw it! listen  can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless
   doglike things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like
   themselves? the price of a changeling i suppose  you know the old
   myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in
   exchange for the human babes they steal pickman was showing what
   happens to those stolen babes  how they grow up  and then i began
   to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and nonhuman
   figures he was in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly
   nonhuman and the degradedly human establishing a sardonic linkage and
   evolution the dogthings were developed from mortals!
         and no sooner had i wondered what he made of their own young as
   left with mankind in the form of changelings than my eye caught a
   picture embodying that very thought it was that of an ancient puritan
   interior  a heavily beamed room with lattice windows a settle and
   clumsy seventeenthcentury furniture with the family sitting about
   while the father read from the scriptures every face but one showed
   nobility and reverence but that one reflected the mockery of the pit
   it was that of a young man in years and no doubt belonged to a
   supposed son of that pious father but in essence it was the kin of the
   unclean things it was their changeling  and in a spirit of supreme
   irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to
   his own
         by this time pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and
   was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if i would care to
   see his modern studies i hadnt been able to give him much of my
   opinions  i was too speechless with fright and loathing  but i
   think he fully understood and felt highly complimented and now i want
   to assure you again eliot that im no mollycoddle to scream at
   anything which shows a bit of departure from the usual im middleaged
   and decently sophisticated and i guess you saw enough of me in france
   to know im not easily knocked out remember too that id just about
   recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which
   turned colonial new england into a kind of annex of hell well in
   spite of all this that next room forced a real scream out of me and i
   had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over the other
   chamber had shown a pack of ghouls and witches overrunning the world
   of our forefathers but this one brought the horror right into our own
   daily life!
         god how that man could paint! there was a study called subway
   accident in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from
   some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the boston street
   subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform another showed
   a dance on copps hill among the tombs with the background of today
   then there were any number of cellar views with monsters creeping in
   through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted
   behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend
   the stairs
         one disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast crosssection of
   beacon hill with antlike armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing
   themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground dances in the
   modern cemeteries were freely pictured and another conception somehow
   shocked me more than all the rest  a scene in an unknown vault where
   scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a wellknown boston
   guidebook and was evidently reading aloud all were pointing to a
   certain passage and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and
   reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes
   the title of the picture was holmes lowell and longfellow lie buried
   in mount auburn
         as i gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second
   room of deviltry and morbidity i began to analyse some of the points
   in my sickening loathing in the first place i said to myself these
   things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity
   they showed in pickman the fellow must be a relentless enemy of all
   mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the
   degradation of the mortal tenement in the second place they terrified
   because of their very greatness their art was the art that convinced
    when we saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were
   afraid of them and the queer part was that pickman got none of his
   power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie nothing was blurred
   distorted or conventionalized; outlines were sharp and lifelike and
   details were almost painfully defined and the faces!
         it was not any mere artists interpretation that we saw; it was
   pandemonium itself crystal clear in stark objectivity that was it by
   heaven! the man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all  he did
   not even try to give us the churning prismatic ephemera of dreams but
   coldly and sardonically reflected some stable mechanistic and
   wellestablished horror  world which he saw fully brilliantly
   squarely and unfalteringly god knows what that world can have been
   or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted
   and crawled through it; but whatever the baffling source of his images
   one thing was plain pickman was in every sense  in conception and in
   execution  a thorough painstaking and almost scientific realist
         my host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual
   studio and i braced myself for some hellish efforts among the
   unfinished canvases as we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he
   fumed his flashlight to a corner of the large open space at hand
   revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in
   the earthen floor we walked nearer and i saw that it must be five
   feet across with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the
   ground level solid work of the seventeenth century or i was much
   mistaken that pickman said was the kind of thing he had been talking
   about an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the
   hill i noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up and that a
   heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover thinking of the things
   this well must have been connected with if pickmans wild hints had not
   been mere rhetoric i shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a
   step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size provided with
   a wooden floor and furnished as a studio an acetylene gas outfit gave
   the light necessary for work
         the unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls
   were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs and showed the
   painstaking methods of the artist scenes were blocked out with extreme
   care and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which
   pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions the man
   was great  i say it even now knowing as much as i do a large camera
   on a table excited my notice and pickman told me that he used it in
   taking scenes for backgrounds so that he might paint them from
   photographs in the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town
   for this or that view he thought a photograph quite as good as an
   actual scene or model for sustained work and declared he employed them
   regularly
         there was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches
   and halffinished monstrosities that leered round from every side of
   the room and when pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side
   away from the light i could not for my life keep back a loud scream 
   the second i had emitted that night it echoed and echoed through the
   dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar and i had to choke
   back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical
   laughter merciful creator! eliot but i dont know how much was real
   and how much was feverish fancy it doesnt seem to me that earth can
   hold a dream like that!
         it was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes
   and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man gnawing at the
   head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy its position was a kind of
   crouch and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its
   present prey and seek a juicier morsel but damn it all it wasnt even
   the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountainhead of all
   panic  not that nor the dog face with its pointed ears bloodshot
   eyes flat nose and drooling lips it wasnt the scaly claws nor the
   mouldcaked body nor the halfhooved feet  none of these though any
   one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madness
         it was the technique eliot  the cursed the impious the
   unnatural technique! as i am a living being i never elsewhere saw the
   actual breath of life so fused into a canvas the monster was there 
   it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared  and i knew that only a
   suspension of natures laws could ever let a man paint a thing like
   that without a model  without some glimpse of the nether world which
   no mortal unsold to the fiend has ever had
         pinned with a thumbtack to a vacant part of the canvas was a
   piece of paper now badly curled up  probably i thought a photograph
   from which pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the
   nightmare it was to enhance i reached out to uncurl and look at it
   when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot he had been listening
   with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked
   unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar and now he seemed struck with a
   fright which though not comparable to my own had in it more of the
   physical than of the spiritual he drew a revolver and motioned me to
   silence then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door
   behind him
         i think i was paralysed for an instant imitating pickmans
   listening i fancied i heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere and a
   series of squeals or beats in a direction i couldnt determine i
   thought of huge rats and shuddered then there came a subdued sort of
   clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh  a furtive groping
   kind of clatter though i cant attempt to convey what i mean in words
   it was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick  wood on brick 
   what did that make me think of?
         it came again and louder there was a vibration as if the wood
   had fallen farther than it had fallen before after that followed a
   sharp grating noise a shouted gibberish from pickman and the
   deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver fired
   spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect a
   muffled squeal or squawk and a thud then more wood and brick grating
   a pause and the opening of the door  at which ill confess i started
   violently pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon cursing the
   bloated rats that infested the ancient well
         the deuce knows what they eat thurber he grinned for those
   archaic tunnels touched graveyard and witchden and seacoast but
   whatever it is they must have run short for they were devilish
   anxious to get out your yelling stirred them up i fancy better be
   cautious in these old places  our rodent friends are the one
   drawback though i sometimes think theyre a positive asset by way of
   atmosphere and colour
         well eliot that was the end of the nights adventure pickman
   had promised to show me the place and heaven knows he had done it he
   led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction it seems for
   when we sighted a lamppost we were in a halffamiliar street with
   monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses charter
   street it turned out to be but i was too flustered to notice just
   where we hit it we were too late for the elevated and walked back
   downtown through hanover street i remember that wall we switched from
   tremont up beacon and pickman left me at the corner of joy where i
   turned off i never spoke to him again
         why did i drop him? dont be impatient wait till i ring for
   coffee weve had enough of the other stuff but i for one need
   something no  it wasnt the paintings i saw in that place; though
   ill swear they were enough to get him ostracised in ninetenths of the
   homes and clubs of boston and i guess you wont wonder now why i have
   to steer clear of subways and cellars it was  something i found in
   my coat the next morning you know the curledup paper tacked to the
   frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing i thought was a photograph of
   some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster that last
   scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it and it seems i had
   vacantly crumpled it into my pocket but heres the coffee  take it
   black eliot if youre wise
         yes that paper was the reason i dropped pickman; richard upton
   pickman the greatest artist i have ever known  and the foulest being
   that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness
   eliot  old reid was right he wasnt strictly human either he was
   born in strange shadow or hed found a way to unlock the forbidden
   gate its all the same now for hes gone  back into the fabulous
   darkness he loved to haunt here lets have the chandelier going
         dont ask me to explain or even conjecture about what i burned
   dont ask me either what lay behind that molelike scrambling pickman
   was so keen to pass off as rats there are secrets you know which
   might have come down from old salem times and cotton mather tells even
   stranger things you know how damned lifelike pickmans paintings were
    how we all wondered where he got those faces
         well  that paper wasnt a photograph of any background after
   all what it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on
   that awful canvas it was the model he was using  and its background
   was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail but by god
   eliot it was a photograph from life!

   poetry and the gods  (1920)

   8832poetry and the godsh p lovecraft1920

   a damp gloomy evening in april it was just after the close of the
   great war when marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and
   wishes unheardof yearnings which floated out of the spacious
   twentiethcentury drawing room up the deeps of the air and eastward
   to olive groves in distant arcady which she had seen only in her
   dreams she had entered the room in abstraction turned off the glaring
   chandeliers and now reclined on a soft divan by a solitary lamp which
   shed over the reading table a green glow as soothing as moonlight when
   it issued through the foliage about an antique shrine

   attired simply in a lowcut black evening dress she appeared
   outwardly a typical product of modern civilization; but tonight she
   felt the immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic
   surroundings was it because of the strange home in which she lived
   that abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the
   inmates scarcely more than strangers? was it that or was it some
   greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space whereby she
   had been born too late too early or too far away from the haunts of
   her spirit ever to harmonize with the unbeautiful things of
   contemporary reality? to dispel the mood which was engulfing her more
   and more deeply each moment she took a magazine from the table and
   searched for some healing bit of poetry poetry had always relieved her
   troubled mind better than anything else though many things in the
   poetry she had seen detracted from the influence over parts of even
   the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of sterile ugliness and
   restraint like dust on a windowpane through which one views a
   magnificent sunset

   listlessly turning the magazines pages as if searching for an elusive
   treasure she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor
   an observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had
   discovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her
   unattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before it was
   only a bit of vers libre that pitiful compromise of the poet who
   overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers; but it
   had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels who
   gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty devoid of regularity it yet
   had the harmony of winged spontaneous words a harmony missing from
   the formal conventionbound verse she had known as she read on her
   surroundings gradually faded and soon there lay about her only the
   mists of dream the purple starstrewn mists beyond time where only
   gods and dreamers walk
moon over japan
white butterfly moon!
where the heavylidded buddhas dream
to the sound of the cuckoos call
the white wings of moon butterflies
flicker down the streets of the city
blushing into silence the useless wicks of soundlanterns in the hands of girls

moon over the tropics
a whitecurved bud
opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven

the air is full of odours
and languorous warm sounds
a flute drones its insect music to the night
below the curving moonpetal of the heavens

moon over china weary moon on the river of the sky
the stir of light in the willows is like the flashing of a thousand silver minno
ws
through dark shoals;
the tiles on graves and rotting temples flash like ripples
the sky is flecked with clouds like the scales of a dragon

   amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars of
   her delight at the coming of a new age of song a rebirth of pan half
   closing her eyes she repeated words whose melody lay hidden like
   crystals at the bottom of a stream before dawn hidden but to gleam
   effulgently at the birth of day
moon over japan
white butterfly moon!

moon over the tropics
a white curved bud
opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven
the air is full of odours
and languorous warm sounds

moon over china
weary moon on the river of the sky

   out of the mists gleamed godlike the form of a youth in winged helmet
   and sandals caduceusbearing and of a beauty like to nothing on
   earth before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which
   apollo had given him in trade for the ninecorded shell of melody and
   upon her brow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses then adoring
   hermes spoke:

   0 nymph more fair than the goldenhaired sisters of cyene or the
   skyinhabiting atlantides beloved of aphrodite and blessed of pallas
   thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the gods which lieth in
   beauty and song 0 prophetess more lovely than the sybil of cumae when
   apollo first knew her thou has truly spoken of the new age for even
   now on maenalus pan sighs and stretches in his sleep wishful to wake
   and behold about him the little rosecrowned fauns and the antique
   satyrs in thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal saving only a
   few whom the world rejects remembereth: that the gods were never dead
   but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of gods in
   lotosfilled hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset and now
   draweth nigh the time of their awakening when coldness and ugliness
   shall perish and zeus sit once more on olympus already the sea about
   paphos trembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on
   before and at night on helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings
   and halfremembered notes woods and fields are tremulous at twilight
   with the shimmering of white saltant forms and immemorial ocean yields
   up curious sights beneath thin moons the gods are patient and have
   slept long but neither man nor giant shall defy the gods forever in
   tartarus the titans writhe and beneath the fiery aetna groan the
   children of uranus and gaea the day now dawns when man must answer for
   centuries of denial but in sleeping the gods have grown kind and will
   not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of gods instead will their
   vengeance smite the darkness fallacy and ugliness which have turned
   the mind of man; and under the sway of bearded saturnus shall mortals
   once more sacrificing unto him dwell in beauty and delight this night
   shalt thou know the favour of the gods and behold on parnassus those
   dreams which the gods have through ages sent to earth to show that they
   are not dead for poets are the dreams of gods and in each and every
   age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the promise from the
   lotosgardens beyond the sunset

   then in his arms hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies
   gentle breezes from the tower of aiolas wafted them high above warm
   scented seas till suddenly they came upon zeus holding court upon
   doubleheaded parnassus his golden throne flanked by apollo and the
   muses on the right hand and by ivywreathed dionysus and
   pleasureflushed bacchae on the left hand so much of splendour marcia
   had never seen before either awake or in dreams but its radiance did
   her no injury as would have the radiance of lofty olympus; for in this
   lesser court the father of gods had tempered his glories for the sight
   of mortals before the laureldraped mouth of the corycian cave sat in
   a row six noble forms with the aspect of mortals but the countenances
   of gods these the dreamer recognized from images of them which she had
   beheld and she knew that they were none else than the divine
   maeonides the avernian dante the more than mortal shakespeare the
   chaosexploring milton the cosmic goethe and the musalan keats these
   were those messengers whom the gods had sent to tell men that pan had
   passed not away but only slept; for it is in poetry that gods speak to
   men then spake the thunderer:

   0 daughterfor being one of my endless line thou art indeed my
   daughterbehold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers
   gods have sent down that in the words and writing of men there may be
   still some traces of divine beauty other bards have men justly crowned
   with enduring laurels but these hath apollo crowned and these have i
   set in places apart as mortals who have spoken the language of the
   gods long have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the west and spoken
   only through our dreams; but the time approaches when our voices shall
   not be silent it is a time of awakening and change once more hath
   phaeton ridden low searing the fields and drying the streams in gaul
   lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no
   more and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals ares
   and his train have gone forth with the madness of gods and have
   returned deimos and phobos glutted with unnatural delight tellus moons
   with grief and the faces of men are as the faces of erinyes even as
   when astraea fled to the skies and the waves of our bidding
   encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone amidst this
   chaos prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival even
   now toileth our latest born messenger in whose dreams are all the
   images which other messengers have dreamed before him he it is that we
   have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the
   world hath known before and to write words wherein shall echo all the
   wisdom and the loveliness of the past he it is who shall proclaim our
   return and sing of the days to come when fauns and dryads shall haunt
   their accustomed groves in beauty guided was our choice by those who
   now sit before the corycian grotto on thrones of ivory and in whose
   songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou
   shalt know the greater messenger when he cometh attend their voices as
   one by one they sing to thee here each note shall thou hear again in
   the poetry which is to come the poetry which shall bring peace and
   pleasure to thy soul though search for it through bleak years thou
   must attend with diligence for each chord that vibrates away into
   hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to earth as
   alpheus sinking his waters into the soul of hellas appears as the
   crystal arethusa in remote sicilia

   then arose homeros the ancient among bards who took his lyre and
   chanted his hymn to aphrodite no word of greek did marcia know yet
   did the message not fall vainly upon her ears for in the cryptic
   rhythm was that which spake to all mortals and gods and needed no
   interpreter

   so too the songs of dante and goethe whose unknown words clave the
   ether with melodies easy to ready and adore but at last remembered
   accents resounded before the listener it was the swan of avon once a
   god among men and still a god among gods:
write write that from the bloody course of war
my dearest master your dear son may hie;
bless him at home in peace whilst i from far
his name with zealous fervour sanctify

   accents still more familiar arose as milton blind no more declaimed
   immortal harmony:
or let thy lamp at midnight hour
be seen in some high lonely tower
where i might oft outwatch the bear
with thricegreat hermes or unsphere
the spirit of plato to unfold
what worlds or what vast regions hold
the immortal mind that hath forsook
her mansion in this fleshy nook

sometime let gorgeous tragedy
in sceptered pall come sweeping by
presenting thebes or pelops line
or the tale of troy divine

   last of all came the young voice of keats closest of all the
   messengers to the beauteous faunfolk:
heard melodies are sweet but those unheard
are sweeter therefore yet sweet pipes play on

when old age shall this generation waste
thou shalt remain in midst of other woe
than ours a friend to man to whom thou sayst
beauty is truth  truth beauty  that is all
ye know on earth and all ye need to know

   as the singer ceased there came a sound in the wind blowing from far
   egypt where at night aurora mourns by the nile for her slain memnon
   to the feet of the thunderer flew the rosyfingered goddess and
   kneeling cried master it is time i unlocked the gates of the east
   and phoebus handing his lyre to calliope his bride among the muses
   prepared to depart for the jewelled and columnraised palace of the
   sun where fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of
   day so zeus descended from his carven throne and placed his hand upon
   the head of marcia saying:

   daughter the dawn is nigh and it is well that thou shouldst return
   before the awakening of mortals to thy home weep not at the bleakness
   of thy life for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the
   gods shall once more walk among men search thou unceasingly for our
   messenger for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort by his word
   shall thy steps be guided to happiness and in his dreams of beauty
   shall thy spirit find that which it craveth as zeus ceased the young
   hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading
   stars up and westward over unseen seas

   many years have passed since marcia dreamt of the gods and of their
   parnassus conclave tonight she sits in the same spacious drawingroom
   but she is not alone gone is the old spirit of unrest for beside her
   is one whose name is luminous with celebrity: the young poet of poets
   at whose feet sits all the world he is reading from a manuscript words
   which none has ever heard before but which when heard will bring to
   men the dreams and the fancies they lost so many centuries ago when
   pan lay down to doze in arcady and the great gods withdrew to sleep in
   lotosgardens beyond the lands of the hesperides in the subtle
   cadences and hidden melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden had
   found rest at last for there echo the divinest notes of thracian
   orpheus notes that moved the very rocks and trees by hebrus banks
   the singer ceases and with eagerness asks a verdict yet what can
   marcia say but that the strain is fit for the gods?

   and as she speaks there comes again a vision of parnassus and the
   faroff sound of a mighty voice saying by his word shall thy steps be
   guided to happiness and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find
   all that it craveth

        into the north window of my chamber glows the pole star with
   uncanny light all through the long hellish hours of blackness it
   shines there and in the autumn of the year when the winds from the
   north curse and whine and the redleaved trees of the swamp mutter
   things to one another in the small hours of the morning under the
   horned waning moon i sit by the easement and watch that star down
   from the heights reels the glittering cassiopeia as the hours wear on
   while charles wain lumbers up from behind the vapoursoaked swamp
   trees that sway in the nightwind just before dawn arcturus winks
   ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock and coma berenices
   shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east; but still the pole
   star leers down from the same place in the black vault winking
   hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some
   strange message yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to
   convey sometimes when it is cloudy i can sleep

        well do i remember the night of the great aurora when over the
   swamp played the shocking coruscations of the daemonlight after the
   beams came clouds and then i slept

        and it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the
   first time still and somnolent did it lie on a strange plateau in a
   hollow betwixt strange peaks of ghastly marble were its walls and its
   towers its columns domes and pavements in the marble streets were
   marble pillars the upper parts of which were carven into the images of
   grave bearded men the air was warm and stirred not and overhead
   scarce ten degrees from the zenith glowed that watching pole star
   long did i gaze on the city but the day came not when the red
   aldebaran which blinked low in the sky but never set had crawled a
   quarter of the way around the horizon i saw light and motion in the
   houses and the streets forms strangely robed but at once noble and
   familiar walked abroad and under the horned waning moon men talked
   wisdom in a tongue which i understood though it was unlike any
   language i had ever known and when the red aldebaran had crawled more
   than half way around the horizon there were again darkness and
   silence

        when i awaked i was not as i had been upon my memory was graven
   the vision of the city and within my soul had arisen another and
   vaguer recollection of whose nature i was not then certain
   thereafter on the cloudy nights when i could sleep i saw the city
   often; sometimes under that horned waning moon and sometimes under the
   hot yellow rays of a sun which did not set but which wheeled low
   around the horizon and on the clear nights the pole star leered as
   never before

        gradually i came to wonder what might be my place in that city on
   the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks at first content to view the
   scene as an allobservant uncorporeal presence i now desired to define
   my relation to it and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who
   conversed each day in the public squares i said to myself this is no
   dream for by what means can i prove the greater reality of that other
   life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and
   the cemetery on the low hillock where the pole star peers into my
   north window each night?

        one night as i listened to the discourse in the large square
   containing many statues i felt a change; and perceived that i had at
   last a bodily form nor was i a stranger in the streets of olathoë
   which lies on the plateau of sarkis betwixt the peaks noton and
   kadiphonek it was my friend alos who spoke and his speech was one
   that pleased my soul for it was the speech of a true man and patriot
   that night had the news come of daikos fall and of the advance of the
   inutos; squat hellish yellow fiends who five years ago appeared out
   of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom and finally
   to besiege our towns having taken the fortified places at the foot of
   the mountains their way now lay open to the plateau unless every
   citizen could resist with the strength of ten men for the squat
   creatures were mighty in the arts of war and knew not the scruples of
   honour which held back our tall greyeyed men of lomar from ruthless
   conquest

        alos my friend was commander of all the forces of the plateau
   and in him lay the last hope of our country on this occasion he spoke
   of the perils to be faced and exhorted the men of olathoë bravest of
   the lomarians to sustain the traditions of their ancestors who when
   forced to move southward from zobna before the advance of the great
   icesheet (even as our descendants must some day flee from the land of
   lomar) valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy longarmed
   cannibal gnophkehs that stood in their way to me alos denied a
   warriors part for i was feeble and given to strange faintings when
   subjected to stress and hardships but my eyes were the keenest in the
   city despite the long hours i gave each day to the study of the
   pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom of the zobnarian fathers; so my
   friend desiring not to doom me to inaction rewarded me with that duty
   which was second nothing in importance to the watchtower of thapnen
   he sent me there to serve as the eyes of our army should the inutos
   attempt to gain the citadel by the narrow pass behind the peak noton
   and thereby surprise the garrison i was to give the signal of fire
   which would warn the waiting soldiers and save the town from immediate
   disaster

        alone i mounted the tower for every man of stout body was needed
   in the passes below my brain was sore dazed with excitement and
   fatigue for i had not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm for
   i loved my native land of lomar and the marble city of olathoë that
   lies betwixt the peaks of noton and kadiphonek

        but as i stood in the towers topmost chamber i beheld the horned
   waning moon red and sinister quivering through the vapours that
   hovered over the distant valley of banof and through an opening in the
   roof glittered the pale pole star fluttering as if alive and leering
   like a fiend and tempter methought its spirit whispered evil counsel
   soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise
   which it repeated over and over:

   slumber watcher till the spheres
   six and twenty thousand years
   have revolvd and i return
   to the spot where now i burn
   other stars anon shall rise
   to the axis of the skies;
   stars that soothe and stars that bless
   with a sweet forgetfulness:
   only when my round is oer
   shall the past disturb thy door

   vainly did i struggle with my drowsiness seeking to connect these
   strange words with some lore of the skies which i had learnt from the
   pnakotic manuscripts my head heavy and reeling drooped to my breast
   and when next i looked up it was in a dream; with the pole star
   grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of
   a dreamswamp and i am still dreaming

        in my shame and despair i sometimes scream frantically begging
   the dreamcreatures around me to waken me ere the inutos steal up the
   pass behind the peak noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these
   creatures are daemons for they laugh at me and tell me i am not
   dreaming they mock me whilst i sleep and whilst the squat yellow foe
   may be creeping silently upon us i have failed in my duty and betrayed
   the marble city of olathoë; i have proven false to alos my friend and
   commander but still these shadows of my dream deride me they say
   there is no land of lomar save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in
   those realms where the pole star shines high and red aldebaran crawls
   low around the horizon there has been naught save ice and snow for
   thousands of years and never a man save squat yellow creatures
   blighted by the cold whom they call esquimaux

        and as i writhe in my guilty agony frantic to save the city whose
   peril every moment grows and vainly striving to shake off this
   unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp
   and a cemetery on a low hillock; the pole star even and monstrous
   leers down from the black vault winking hideously like an insane
   watching eye which strives to convey some strange message yet recalls
   nothing save that it once had a message to convey

   wellno sooner had my epistle gone out of the house that the
   expressman brought your welcome packetthe geography & the lady
   have thumbed through the pages of the former & it looks as though it
   promises an even rarer feast than the kindred volumes i have recently
   read old montys scholarship certainly is profound to the very last
   degree i shall be interested to see how far the lady comes forward
   justifying the intemperate admiration of comte derlette & jehvishei

   dark chamber & cuttings will go on the road as soon as i get down
   town the weather has slightly moderated so that i may make it today
   or tomorrow

   this card shews a finely panelled room taken from an old house at the
   front of the hill not so very far from here i never saw it in its
   original site but have visited it in its present brooklyn habitat
   another room from the same house is in a museum in minneapolis
   minnyoung melmoths home territory the old brick house stripped of
   its fine woodwork still standsin a neighbourhood of slowly decaying
   commercialism

   yrs with the blessing of nefrenka

   providence
   by h p lovecraft

   written may 1924; published 26 september 1924
   9565providenceh p lovecraft

   where bay and river tranquil blend
   and leafy hillsides rise
   the spires of providence ascend
   against the ancient skies
   and in the narrow winding ways
   that climb oer slope and crest
   the magic of forgotten days
   may still be found to rest
   a fanlights gleam a knockers blow
   a glimpse of georgian brick 
   the sights and sounds of long ago
   where fancies cluster thick
   a flight of steps with iron rail
   a belfry looming tall
   a slender steeple carved and pale
   a mossgrown garden wall
   a hidden churchyards crumbling proofs
   of mans mortality
   a rotting wharf where gambrel roofs
   keep watch above the sea
   square and parade whose walls have towered
   full fifteen decades long
   by cobbled ways mid trees embowered
   and slighted by the throng
   stone bridges spanning languid streams
   houses perched on the hill
   and courts where mysteries and dreams
   the brooding spirit fill
   steep alley steps by vines concealed
   where smallpaned windows glow
   at twilight on a bit of field
   that chance has left below
   my providence! what airy hosts
   turn still thy gilded vanes;
   what winds of elf that with grey ghosts
   people thine ancient lanes!
   the chimes of evening as of old
   above thy valleys sound
   while thy stern fathers neath the mould
   make blest thy sacred ground

   psychopompos: a tale in rhyme

   1336947psychopompos: a tale in rhymehp lovecraft

   i am he who howls in the night;
   i am he who moans in the snow;
   i am he who hath never seen light;
   i am he who mounts from below
   my car is the car of death;
   my wings are the wings of dread;
   my breath is the north winds breath;
   my prey are the cold and the dead
   in old auvergne when schools were poor and few
   and peasants fancyd what they scarcely knew
   when lords and gentry shunnd their monarchs throne
   for solitary castles of their own
   there dwelt a man of rank whose fortress stood
   in the hushd twilight of a hoary wood
   de blois his name; his lineage high and vast
   a proud memorial of an honourd past;
   but curious swains would whisper now and then
   that sieur de blois was not as other men
   in person dark and lean with glossy hair
   and gleaming teeth that he would often bare
   with piercing eye and stealthy roving glance
   and tongue that clipt the soft sweet speech of france;
   the sieur was little lovd and seldom seen
   so close he kept within his own demesne
   the castle servants few discreet and old
   full many a tale of strangeness might have told;
   but bowd with years they rarely left the door
   wherein their sires and grandsires servd before
   thus gossip rose as gossip rises best
   when mystery imparts a keener zest;
   seclusion oft the poison tongue attracts
   and scandal prospers on a dearth of facts
   twas said the sieur had more than once been spyd
   alone at midnight by the rivers side
   with aspect so uncouth and gaze so strange
   that rustics crossd themselves to see the change;
   yet none when pressd could clearly say or know
   just what it was or why they trembled so
   de blois as rumour whisperd feard to pray
   nor usd his chapel on the sabbath day;
   howeer this may have been twas known at least
   his household had no chaplain monk or priest
   but if the master livd in dubious fame
   twice feard and hated was his noble dame;
   as dark as he in features wild and proud
   and with a weird supernal grace endowd
   the haughty mistress scornd the rural train
   who sought to learn her source but sought in vain
   old women calld her eyes too bright by half
   and nervous children shiverd at her laugh;
   richard the dwarf (whose word had little weight)
   vowd she was like a serpent in her gait
   whilst ancient pierre (the aged often err)
   laid all her husbands mystery to her
   still more absurd were those odd mutterd things
   that calumny to curious listners brings;
   those subtle slanders told with downcast face
   and muffled voicethose tales no man may trace;
   tales that the faith of old wives can command
   tho always heard at sixth or seventh hand
   thus village legend darkly would imply
   that dame de blois possessd an evil eye;
   or going further furtively suggest
   a lurking spark of sorcery in her breast;
   old mère allard (herself half witch) once said
   the ladys glance workd strangely on the dead
   so livd the pair like many another two
   that shun the crowd and shrink from public view
   they scornd the doubts by evry peasant shewn
   and askd but one thingto be let alone!
   twas candlemas the dreariest time of year
   with fall long gone and spring too far to cheer
   when little jean the bailiffs son and heir
   fell sick and threw the doctors in despair
   a child so stout and strong that few would think
   an hour might carry him to deaths dark brink
   yet pale he lay tho hidden was the cause
   and galens searchd in vain thro natures laws
   but stricken sadness could not quite suppress
   the roving thought or wrinkled grandams guess:
   tho spoke by stealth twas known to half a score
   that dame de blois rode by the day before;
   she had (they said) with glances weird and wild
   pausd by the gate to view the prattling child
   nor did they like the smile which seemd to trace
   new lines of evil on her proud dark face
   these things they whisperd when the mothers cry
   told of the endthe gentle soul gone by;
   in genuine grief the kindly watcher wept
   whilst the lovd babe with saints and angels slept
   the village priest his simple rites went thro
   and good michel naild up the box of yew;
   around the corpse the holy candles burnd
   the mourners sighed the parents dumbly yearnd
   then one by one each sought his humble bed
   and left the lonely mother with her dead
   late in the night it was when oer the vale
   the stormking swept with pandemoniac gale;
   deep pild the cruel snow yet strange to tell
   the lightning sputterd while the white flakes fell;
   a hideous presence seemd abroad to steal
   and terror sounded in the thunders peal
   within the house of grief the tapers glowd
   whilst the poor mother bowd beneath her load;
   her salty eyes too tired now to weep
   too paind to see too sad to close in sleep
   the clock struck three above the tempest heard
   when something near the lifeless infant stirrd;
   some slippry thing that floppd in awkward way
   and climbd the table where the coffin lay;
   with scaly convolutions strove to find
   the cold still clay that death had left behind
   the nodding mother hearsstarts broad awake
   empowerd to reason yet too stunnd to shake;
   the poisnous thing she sees and nimbly foils
   the ghoulish purpose of the quivring coils:
   with ready axe the serpents head she cleaves
   and thrills with savage triumph whilst she grieves
   the injurd reptile hissing glides from sight
   and hides its cloven carcass in the night
   the weeks slippd by and gossips tongue began
   to call the sieur de blois an alterd man;
   with curious mien he oft would pace along
   the village street and eye the gaping throng
   yet whilst he shewd himself as neer before
   his wildeyed lady was observd no more
   in course of time twas scarce thought odd or ill
   that he his ears with village lore should fill;
   nor was the town with special rumour rife
   when he sought out the bailiff and his wife:
   their tale of sorrow with its ghastly end
   was told indeed by evry wondring friend
   the sieur heard all and lowring rode away
   nor was he seen again for many a day
   when vernal sunshine shed its cheering glow
   and genial zephyrs blew away the snow
   to frightend swains a horror was reveald
   in the damp herbage of a melting field
   there (half preservd by winters frigid bed)
   lay the dark dame de blois untimely dead;
   by some assassins stroke most foully slain
   her shapely brow and temples cleft in twain
   reluctant hands the dismal burden bore
   to the stone arches of the husbands door
   where silent serfs the ghastly thing receivd
   trembling with fright but less amazd than grievd;
   the sieur his dame beheld with blazing eyes
   and shook with anger more than with surprise
   (at least tis thus the stupid peasants told
   their widemouthd wives when they the tale unrolld)
   the village wonderd why de blois had kept
   his spouses loss unmentiond and unwept
   nor were there lacking slandrous tongues to claim
   that the dark master was himself to blame
   but village talk could scarcely hope to solve
   a crime so deep and thus the months revolve:
   the rural train repeat the gruesome tale
   and gape and marvel more than they bewail
   swift flew the sun and winter once again
   with icy talons grippd the frigid plain
   december brought its store of christmas cheer
   and grateful peasants haild the opning year;
   but by the hearth as candlemas drew nigh
   the whispring ancients spoke of things gone by
   few had forgot the dark demoniac lore
   of things that came the candlemas before
   and many a crone intently eyed the house
   where dwelt the saddend bailiff and his spouse
   at last the day arrivd the sky oerspread
   with darkning messengers and clouds of lead;
   each neighbring grove aeolian warnings sighd
   and thickning terrors broadcast seemd to bide
   the good folk tho they knew not why would run
   swift past the bailiffs door the scene to shun;
   within the house the grieving couple wept
   and mournd the child who now forever slept
   on rushd the dusk in doubly hideous form
   borne on the pinions of the gathring storm;
   unusual murmurs filld the rainless wind
   the rising river lashd the troubled shore;
   black thro the night the awful stormgod prowld
   and froze the listners lifeblood as he howld;
   gigantic trees like supple rushes swayd
   whilst for his home the trembling cotter prayd
   now falls a sudden lull amidst the gale;
   with lessning force the circling currents wail;
   far down the stream that laves the neighbring mead
   burst a new ululation wildly keyd;
   the peasant train a frantic mien assume
   and huddle closer in the spectral gloom:
   to each straind ear the truth too well is known
   for that dread sound can come from wolves alone!
   the rustics close attend when ere they think
   a lupine army swarms the rivers brink;
   from out the waters leap a howling train
   that rend the air and scatter oer the plain:
   with flaming orbs the frothing creatures fly
   and chant with hellish voice their hungry cry
   first of the pack a mighty monster leaps
   with fearless tread and martial order keeps;
   th attendant wolves his yelping tones obey
   and form in columns for the coming fray:
   no frightend swain they harm but silent bound
   with a fixd purpose oer the frozen ground
   straight course the monsters thro the village street
   unholy vigour in their flying feet;
   thro halfshut blinds the shelterd peasants peer
   and wax in wonder as they lose in fear
   th excited pack at last their goal perceive
   and the vexd air with deafning clamour cleave;
   the churls astonishd watch th unnatural herd
   flock round a cottage at the leaders word:
   quick spreads the fearsome fact by rumour blown
   that the doomd cottage is the bailiffs own!
   round and around the howling daemons glide
   whilst the fierce leader scales the vineclad side;
   the frantic wind its horrid wail renews
   and mutters madly thro the lifeless yews
   in the frail house the bailiff calmly waits
   the ravning horde and trusts th impartial fates
   but the wan wife revives with curious mien
   another monster and an older scene;
   amidst th increasing wind that rocks the walls
   the dame to him the serpents deed recalls:
   then as a nameless thought fills both their minds
   the barefangd leader crashes thro the blinds
   across the room with murdrous fury rife
   leaps the mad wolf and seizes on the wife;
   with strange intent he drags his shrieking prey
   close to the spot where once the coffin lay
   wilder and wilder roars the mounting gale
   that sweeps the hills and hurtles thro the vale;
   the illmade cottage shakes the pack without
   dance with new fury in demoniac rout
   quick as his thought the valiant bailiff stands
   above the wolf a weapon in his hands;
   the ready axe that servd a year before
   now serves as well to slay one monster more
   the creature drops inert with shatterd head
   full on the floor and silent as the dead;
   the rescud wife recalls the dire alarms
   and faints from terror in her husbands arms
   but as he holds her all the cottage quakes
   and with full force the titan tempest breaks:
   down crash the walls and oer their shrinking forms
   burst the mad revels of the storm of storms
   th encircling wolves advance with ghastly pace
   hunger and murder in each gleaming face
   but as they close from out the hideous night
   flashes a bolt of unexpected light:
   the vivid scene to evry eye appears
   and peasants shiver with returning fears
   above the wreck the scatheless chimney stays
   its outline glimmring in the fitful rays
   whilst oer the hearth still hangs the household shrine
   the saviours image and the cross divine!
   round the blest spot a lambent radiance glows
   and shields the cotters from their stealthy foes:
   each monstrous creature marks the wondrous glare
   drops fades and vanishes in empty air!
   the village train with startled eyes adore
   and count their beads in revrence oer and oer
   now fades the light and dies the raging blast
   the hour of dread and reign of horror past
   pallid and bruisd from out his toppled walls
   the panting bailiff with his good wife crawls:
   kind hands attend them whilst oer all the town
   a strange sweet peace of spirit settles down
   wonder and fear are stilld in soothing sleep
   as thro the breaking clouds the moon rays peep
   here pausd the prattling grandam in her speech
   confusd with age the tale half out of reach;
   the listning guest impatient for a clue
   fears tis not one tale but a blend of two;
   he fain would know how fard the widowd lord
   whose eerie ways th initial theme afford
   and marvels that the crone so quick should slight
   his fate to babble of the wolfwrackd night
   the old wife pressd for greater clearness strives
   nods wisely and her scatterd wits revives;
   yet strangely lingers on her latter tale
   of wolf and bailiff miracle and gale
   when (quoth the crone) the dawns bright radiance bathd
   th eventful scene so late in terror swathd
   the chattring churls that sought the ruind cot
   found a new marvel in the gruesome spot
   from fallen walls a trail of gory red
   as of the stricken wolf erratic led;
   oer road and mead the newdript crimson wound
   till lost amidst the neighbring swampy ground:
   with wonder unappeasd the peasants burnd
   for what the quicksand takes is neer returnd
   once more the grandam with a knowing eye
   stops in her tale to watch a hawk soar by;
   the weary listner baffled seeks anew
   for some plain statement or enlightning clue
   th indulgent crone attends the puzzled plea
   yet strangely mutters oer the mystery
   the sieur? ah yesthat morning all in vain
   his shaking servants scourd the frozen plain;
   no man had seen him since he rode away
   in silence on the dark preceding day
   his horse wildeyed with some unusual fright
   came wandring from the riverbank that night
   his huntinghound that mournd with piteous woe
   howld by the quicksand swamp his grief to shew
   the village folk thought much but utterd less;
   the servants search wore out in emptiness:
   for sieur de blois (the old wifes tale is oer)
   was lost to mortal sight for evermore

   in a vale of light and laughter
   shining neath the friendly sun
   where fulfilment followd after
   evry hope or dream begun;
   where an aidenn gay and glorious
   beckond down the winsome way;
   there my soul oer pain victorious
   laughd and lingered  yesterday
   green and narrow was my valley
   temperd with a verdant shade;
   sun deckd brooklets musically
   sparkled thro each glorious glade;
   and at night the stars serenely
   glowd betwixt the boughs oerhead
   while astarte calm and queenly
   floods of fairy radiance shed
   there amid the tinted bowers
   rapturd with the opiate spell
   of the grasses ferns and flowers
   poppy phlox and pimpernel
   long i lay entrancd and dreaming
   pleasd with natures bounteous store
   till i markd the shaded gleaming
   of the sky and yearnd for more
   eagerly the branches tearing
   cleard i all the space above
   till the bolder gaze high faring
   scannd the naked skies of jove;
   deeps unguessd now shone before me
   splendid beamd the solar car;
   wings of fervid fancy bore me
   out beyond the farthest star
   reaching gasping wishing longing
   for the pageant brought to sight
   vain i watchd the gold orbs thronging
   round the celestial poles of light
   madly on a moonbeam ladder
   heavns abyss i sought to scale
   ever wiser ever sadder
   as the fruitless task would fail
   then with futile striving sated
   veerd my soul to earth again
   well content that i was fated
   for a fair yet low domain;
   pleasing thoughts of glad tomorrows
   like the blissful moments past
   lulld to rest my transient sorrows
   stild my godless greed at last
   but my downward glance returning
   shrank in fright from what it spyd;
   slopes in hideous torment burning
   terror in the brooklets tide:
   for the dell of shade denuded
   by my desecrating hand
   neath the bare sky blazd and brooded
   as a lost accursed land

   the cloudless day is richer at its close;
     a golden glory settles on the lea;
   soft stealing shadows hint of cool repose
     to mellowing landscape and to calming sea
   and in that nobler gentler lovelier light
     the soul to sweeter loftier bliss inclines;
   freed from the noonday glare the favourd sight
     increasing grace in earth and sky divines
   but ere the purest radiance crowns the green
     or fairest lustre fills th expectant grove
   the twilight thickens and the fleeting scene
     leaves but a hallowd memory of love!

                               by percy simple

chapter i[edit]

                            a simple rustic maid

   ermengarde stubbs was the beauteous blonde daughter of hiram stubbs a
   poor but honest farmerbootlegger of hogton vt her name was
   originally ethyl ermengarde but her father persuaded her to drop the
   praenomen after the passage of the 18th amendment averring that it
   made him thirsty by reminding him of ethyl alcohol c[2]h[5]oh his own
   products contained mostly methyl or wood alcohol ch[3]oh ermengarde
   confessed to sixteen summers and branded as mendacious all reports to
   the effect that she was thirty she had large black eyes a prominent
   roman nose light hair which was never dark at the roots except when
   the local drug store was short on supplies and a beautiful but
   inexpensive complexion she was about 5^ft 533^in tall weighed
   11547 lbs on her fathers copy scales  also off them  and was
   adjudged most lovely by all the village swains who admired her fathers
   farm and liked his liquid crops

   ermengardes hand was sought in matrimony by two ardent lovers squire
   hardman who had a mortgage on the old home was very rich and elderly
   he was dark and cruelly handsome and always rode horseback and carried
   a ridingcrop long had he sought the radiant ermengarde and now his
   ardour was fanned to fever heat by a secret known to him alone  for
   upon the humble acres of farmer stubbs he had discovered a vein of rich
   gold!! aha! said he i will win the maiden ere her parent knows of
   his unsuspected wealth and join to my fortune a greater fortune
   still! and so he began to call twice a week instead of once as before

   but alas for the sinister designs of a villain  squire hardman was
   not the only suitor for the fair one close by the village dwelt
   another the handsome jack manly whose curly yellow hair had won the
   sweet ermengardes affection when both were toddling youngsters at the
   village school jack had long been too bashful to declare his passion
   but one day while strolling along a shady lane by the old mill with
   ermengarde he had found courage to utter that which was within his
   heart

   o light of my life said he my soul is so overburdened that i must
   speak! ermengarde my ideal [he pronounced it ideel!] life has become
   an empty thing without you beloved of my spirit behold a suppliant
   kneeling in the dust before thee ermengarde  oh ermengarde raise me
   to an heaven of joy and say that you will some day be mine! it is true
   that i am poor but have i not youth and strength to fight my way to
   fame? this i can do only for you dear ethyl pardon me ermengarde  my
   only my most precious   but here he paused to wipe his eyes and mop
   his brow and the fair responded:

   jack  my angel  at last  i mean this is so unexpected and quite
   unprecedented! i had never dreamed that you entertained sentiments of
   affection in connexion with one so lowly as farmer stubbs child  for
   i am still but a child! such is your natural nobility that i had feared
    i mean thought  you would be blind to such slight charms as i
   possess and that you would seek your fortune in the great city; there
   meeting and wedding one of those more comely damsels whose splendour we
   observe in fashion books

   but jack since it is really i whom you adore let us waive all
   needless circumlocution jack  my darling  my heart has long been
   susceptible to your manly graces i cherish an affection for thee 
   consider me thine own and be sure to buy the ring at perkins hardware
   store where they have such nice imitation diamonds in the window

   ermengarde me love!

   jack  my precious!

   my darling!

   my own!

   my gawd!

                                  [curtain]

chapter ii[edit]

                      and the villain still pursued her

   but these tender passages sacred though their fervour did not pass
   unobserved by profane eyes; for crouched in the bushes and gritting his
   teeth was the dastardly squire hardman! when the lovers had finally
   strolled away he leapt out into the lane viciously twirling his
   moustache and ridingcrop and kicking an unquestionably innocent cat
   who was also out strolling

   curses! he cried  hardman not the cat  i am foiled in my plot to
   get the farm and the girl! but jack manly shall never succeed! i am a
   man of power  and we shall see!

   thereupon he repaired to the humble stubbs cottage where he found the
   fond father in the stillcellar washing bottles under the supervision
   of the gentle wife and mother hannah stubbs coming directly to the
   point the villain spoke:

   farmer stubbs i cherish a tender affection of long standing for your
   lovely offspring ethyl ermengarde i am consumed with love and wish
   her hand in matrimony always a man of few words i will not descend to
   euphemism give me the girl or i will foreclose the mortgage and take
   the old home!

   but sir pleaded the distracted stubbs while his stricken spouse
   merely glowered i am sure the childs affections are elsewhere
   placed

   she must be mine! sternly snapped the sinister squire i will make
   her love me  none shall resist my will! either she becomes muh wife or
   the old homestead goes!

   and with a sneer and flick of his ridingcrop squire hardman strode
   out into the night

   scarce had he departed when there entered by the back door the radiant
   lovers eager to tell the senior stubbses of their newfound happiness
   imagine the universal consternation which reigned when all was known!
   tears flowed like white ale till suddenly jack remembered he was the
   hero and raised his head declaiming in appropriately virile accents:

   never shall the fair ermengarde be offered up to this beast as a
   sacrifice while i live! i shall protect her  she is mine mine mine 
   and then some! fear not dear father and mother to be  i will defend
   you all! you shall have the old home still [adverb not noun  although
   jack was by no means out of sympathy with stubbs kind of farm produce]
   and i shall lead to the altar the beauteous ermengarde loveliest of
   her sex! to perdition with the crool squire and his illgotten gold 
   the right shall always win and a hero is always in the right! i will
   go to the great city and there make a fortune to save you all ere the
   mortgage fall due! farewell my love  i leave you now in tears but i
   shall return to pay off the mortgage and claim you as my bride!

   jack my protector!

   ermie my sweet roll!

   dearest!

   darling!  and dont forget that ring at perkins

   oh!

   ah!

                                  [curtain]

chapter iii[edit]

                               a dastardly act

   but the resourceful squire hardman was not so easily to be foiled
   close by the village lay a disreputable settlement of unkempt shacks
   populated by a shiftless scum who lived by thieving and other odd jobs
   here the devilish villain secured two accomplices  illfavoured
   fellows who were very clearly no gentlemen and in the night the evil
   three broke into the stubbs cottage and abducted the fair ermengarde
   taking her to a wretched hovel in the settlement and placing her under
   the charge of mother maria a hideous old hag farmer stubbs was quite
   distracted and would have advertised in the papers if the cost had
   been less than a cent a word for each insertion ermengarde was firm
   and never wavered in her refusal to wed the villain

   aha my proud beauty quoth he i have ye in me power and sooner or
   later i will break that will of thine! meanwhile think of your poor old
   father and mother as turned out of hearth and home and wandering
   helpless through the meadows!

   oh spare them spare them! said the maiden

   never    ha ha ha ha! leered the brute

   and so the cruel days sped on while all in ignorance young jack manly
   was seeking fame and fortune in the great city

chapter iv[edit]

                               subtle villainy

   one day as squire hardman sat in the front parlour of his expensive
   and palatial home indulging in his favourite pastime of gnashing his
   teeth and swishing his ridingcrop a great thought came to him; and he
   cursed aloud at the statue of satan on the onyx mantelpiece

   fool that i am! he cried why did i ever waste all this trouble on
   the girl when i can get the farm by simply foreclosing? i never thought
   of that! i will let the girl go take the farm and be free to wed some
   fair city maid like the leading lady of that burlesque troupe which
   played last week at the town hall!

   and so he went down to the settlement apologised to ermengarde let
   her go home and went home himself to plot new crimes and invent new
   modes of villainy

   the days wore on and the stubbses grew very sad over the coming loss
   of their home and still but nobody seemed able to do anything about it
   one day a party of hunters from the city chanced to stray over the old
   farm and one of them found the gold!! hiding his discovery from his
   companions he feigned rattlesnakebite and went to the stubbs cottage
   for aid of the usual kind ermengarde opened the door and saw him he
   also saw her and in that moment resolved to win her and the gold for
   my old mothers sake i must  he cried loudly to himself no
   sacrifice is too great!

chapter v[edit]

                                the city chap

   algernon reginald jones was a polished man of the world from the great
   city and in his sophisticated hands our poor little ermengarde was as
   a mere child one could almost believe that sixteenyearold stuff
   algy was a fast worker but never crude he could have taught hardman a
   thing or two about finesse in sheiking thus only a week after his
   advent to the stubbs family circle where he lurked like the vile
   serpent that he was he had persuaded the heroine to elope! it was in
   the night that she went leaving a note for her parents sniffing the
   familiar mash for the last time and kissing the cat goodbye  touching
   stuff! on the train algernon became sleepy and slumped down in his
   seat allowing a paper to fall out of his pocket by accident
   ermengarde taking advantage of her supposed position as a brideelect
   picked up the folded sheet and read its perfumed expanse  when lo! she
   almost fainted! it was a love letter from another woman!!

   perfidious deceiver! she whispered at the sleeping algernon so this
   is all that your boasted fidelity amounts to! i am done with you for
   all eternity!

   so saying she pushed him out the window and settled down for a much
   needed rest

chapter vi[edit]

                           alone in the great city

   when the noisy train pulled into the dark station at the city poor
   helpless ermengarde was all alone without the money to get back to
   hogton oh why she sighed in innocent regret didnt i take his
   pocketbook before i pushed him out? oh well i should worry! he told me
   all about the city so i can easily earn enough to get home if not to
   pay off the mortgage!

   but alas for our little heroine  work is not easy for a greenhorn to
   secure so for a week she was forced to sleep on park benches and
   obtain food from the breadline once a wily and wicked person
   perceiving her helplessness offered her a position as dishwasher in a
   fashionable and depraved cabaret; but our heroine was true to her
   rustic ideals and refused to work in such a gilded and glittering
   palace of frivolity  especially since she was offered only $300 per
   week with meals but no board she tried to look up jack manly her
   onetime lover but he was nowhere to be found perchance too he
   would not have known her; for in her poverty she had perforce become a
   brunette again and jack had not beheld her in that state since school
   days one day she found a neat but costly purse in the dark; and after
   seeing that there was not much in it took it to the rich lady whose
   card proclaimed her ownership delighted beyond words at the honesty of
   this forlorn waif the aristocratic mrs van itty adopted ermengarde to
   replace the little one who had been stolen from her so many years ago
   how like my precious maude she sighed as she watched the fair
   brunette return to blondeness and so several weeks passed with the
   old folks at home tearing their hair and the wicked squire hardman
   chuckling devilishly

chapter vii[edit]

                            happy ever afterward

   one day the wealthy heiress ermengarde s van itty hired a new second
   assistant chauffeur struck by something familiar in his face she
   looked again and gasped lo! it was none other than the perfidious
   algernon reginald jones whom she had pushed from a car window on that
   fateful day! he had survived  this much was almost immediately
   evident also he had wed the other woman who had run away with the
   milkman and all the money in the house now wholly humbled he asked
   forgiveness of our heroine and confided to her the whole tale of the
   gold on her fathers farm moved beyond words she raised his salary a
   dollar a month and resolved to gratify at last that always unquenchable
   anxiety to relieve the worry of the old folks so one bright day
   ermengarde motored back to hogton and arrived at the farm just as
   squire hardman was foreclosing the mortgage and ordering the old folks
   out

   stay villain! she cried flashing a colossal roll of bills you are
   foiled at last! here is your money  now go and never darken our
   humble door again!

   then followed a joyous reunion whilst the squire twisted his moustache
   and ridingcrop in bafflement and dismay but hark! what is this?
   footsteps sound on the old gravel walk and who should appear but our
   hero jack manly  worn and seedy but radiant of face seeking at once
   the downcast villain he said:

   squire  lend me a tenspot will you? i have just come back from the
   city with my beauteous bride the fair bridget goldstein and need
   something to start things on the old farm then turning to the
   stubbses he apologised for his inability to pay off the mortgage as
   agreed

   dont mention it said ermengarde prosperity has come to us and i
   will consider it sufficient payment if you will forget forever the
   foolish fancies of our childhood

   all this time mrs van itty had been sitting in the motor waiting for
   ermengarde; but as she lazily eyed the sharpfaced hannah stubbs a
   vague memory started from the back of her brain then it all came to
   her and she shrieked accusingly at the agrestic matron

   you  you  hannah smith  i know you now! twentyeight years ago you
   were my baby maudes nurse and stole her from the cradle!! where oh
   where is my child? then a thought came as the lightning in a murky
   sky ermengarde  you say she is your daughter she is mine! fate
   has restored to me my old cheeild  my tiny maudie! ermengarde  maude
    come to your mothers loving arms!!!

   but ermengarde was doing some tall thinking how could she get away
   with the sixteenyearold stuff if she had been stolen twentyeight
   years ago? and if she was not stubbs daughter the gold would never be
   hers mrs van itty was rich but squire hardman was richer so
   approaching the dejected villain she inflicted upon him the last
   terrible punishment

   squire dear she murmured i have reconsidered all i love you and
   your naive strength marry me at once or i will have you prosecuted for
   that kidnapping last year foreclose your mortgage and enjoy with me
   the gold your cleverness discovered come dear! and the poor dub did

   high up crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are
   wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest
   stands the old chateau of my ancestors for centuries its lofty
   battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside
   about serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose
   honoured line is older even than the mossgrown castle walls these
   ancient turrets stained by the storms of generations and crumbling
   under the slow yet mighty pressure of time formed in the ages of
   feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all
   france from its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements barons
   counts and even kings had been defied yet never had its spacious
   halls resounded to the footstep of the invader

   but since those glorious years all is changed a poverty but little
   above the level of dire want together with a pride of name that
   forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life have
   prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in
   pristine splendour; and the falling stones of the walls the overgrown
   vegetation in the parks the dry and dusty moat the illpaved
   courtyards and toppling towers without as well as the sagging floors
   the wormeaten wainscots and the faded tapestries within all tell a
   gloomy tale of fallen grandeur as the ages passed first one then
   another of the four great turrets were left to ruin until at last but
   a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty
   lords of the estate

   it was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower
   that i antoine last of the unhappy and accursed comtes de c
   first saw the light of day ninety long years ago within these walls
   and amongst the dark and shadowy forests the wild ravines and grottoes
   of the hillside below were spent the first years of my troubled life
   my parents i never knew my father had been killed at the age of
   thirtytwo a month before i was born by the fall of a stone somehow
   dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle and my
   mother having died at my birth my care and education devolved solely
   upon one remaining servitor an old and trusted man of considerable
   intelligence whose name i remember as pierre i was an only child and
   the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was
   augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian in
   excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were
   scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the
   hill at the time pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon
   me because my noble birth placed me above association with such
   plebeian company now i know that its real object was to keep from my
   ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly
   told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed
   accents in the glow of their cottage hearths

   thus isolated and thrown upon my own resources i spent the hours of
   my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the
   shadowhaunted library of the chateau and in roaming without aim or
   purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes
   the sides of the hill near its foot it was perhaps an effect of such
   surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy those
   studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature
   most strongly claimed my attention

   of my own race i was permitted to learn singularly little yet what
   small knowledge of it i was able to gain seemed to depress me much
   perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old
   preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the
   terror which i ever felt at the mention of my great house yet as i
   grew out of childhood i was able to piece together disconnected
   fragments of discourse let slip from the unwilling tongue which had
   begun to falter in approaching senility that had a sort of relation to
   a certain circumstance which i had always deemed strange but which now
   became dimly terrible the circumstance to which i allude is the early
   age at which all the comtes of my line had met their end whilst i had
   hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of
   shortlived men i afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths
   and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man who often
   spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the
   holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirtytwo years
   upon my twentyfirst birthday the aged pierre gave to me a family
   document which he said had for many generations been handed down from
   father to son and continued by each possessor its contents were of
   the most startling nature and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my
   apprehensions at this time my belief in the supernatural was firm and
   deepseated else i should have dismissed with scorn the incredible
   narrative unfolded before my eyes

   the paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century when
   the old castle in which i sat had been a feared and impregnable
   fortress it told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our
   estates a person of no small accomplishments though little above the
   rank of peasant; by name michel usually designated by the surname of
   mauvais the evil on account of his sinister reputation he had
   studied beyond the custom of his kind seeking such things as the
   philosophers stone or the elixir of eternal life and was reputed
   wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy michel mauvais
   had one son named charles a youth as proficient as himself in the
   hidden arts and who had therefore been called le sorcier or the
   wizard this pair shunned by all honest folk were suspected of the
   most hideous practices old michel was said to have burnt his wife
   alive as a sacrifice to the devil and the unaccountable disappearances
   of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these
   two yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one
   redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with
   fierce intensity whilst the youth had for his parent a more than
   filial affection

   one night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion
   by the vanishment of young godfrey son to henri the comte a
   searching party headed by the frantic father invaded the cottage of
   the sorcerers and there came upon old michel mauvais busy over a huge
   and violently boiling cauldron without certain cause in the
   ungoverned madness of fury and despair the comte laid hands on the
   aged wizard and ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no
   more meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming aloud the finding of
   young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice
   telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain as the comte
   and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists
   the form of charles le sorcier appeared through the trees the excited
   chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred yet
   he seemed at first unmoved at his fathers fate then slowly advancing
   to meet the comte he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse
   that ever afterward haunted the house of c

   may neer a noble of thy murdrous line
   survive to reach a greater age than thine!

   spake he when suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood he drew
   from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw in the face
   of his fathers slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the
   night the comte died without utterance and was buried the next day
   but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth
   no trace of the assassin could be found though relentless bands of
   peasants scoured the neighboring woods and the meadowland around the
   hill

   thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in
   the minds of the late comtes family so that when godfrey innocent
   cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title was killed by an
   arrow whilst hunting at the age of thirtytwo there were no thoughts
   save those of grief at his demise but when years afterward the next
   young comte robert by name was found dead in a nearby field from no
   apparent cause the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had
   but lately passed his thirtysecond birthday when surprised by early
   death louis son to robert was found drowned in the moat at the same
   fateful age and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous
   chronicle; henris roberts antoines and armands snatched from happy
   and virtuous lives when a little below the age of their unfortunate
   ancestor at his murder

   that i had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made
   certain to me by the words which i read my life previously held at
   small value now became dearer to me each day as i delved deeper and
   deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic isolated
   as i was modern science had produced no impression upon me and i
   laboured as in the middle ages as wrapt as had been old michel and
   young charles themselves in the acquisition of demonological and
   alchemical learning yet read as i might in no manner could i account
   for the strange curse upon my line in unusually rational moments i
   would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation attributing the
   early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister charles le sorcier and his
   heirs; yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known
   descendants of the alchemist i would fall back to my occult studies
   and once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house
   from its terrible burden upon one thing i was absolutely resolved i
   should never wed for since no other branches of my family were in
   existence i might thus end the curse with myself

   as i drew near the age of thirty old pierre was called to the land
   beyond alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about
   which he had loved to wander in life thus was i left to ponder on
   myself as the only human creature within the great fortress and in my
   utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the
   impending doom to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many
   of my ancestors had met much of my time was now occupied in the
   exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old
   chateau which in youth fear had caused me to shun and some of which
   old pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over
   four centuries strange and awsome were many of the objects i
   encountered furniture covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with
   the rot of long dampness met my eyes cobwebs in a profusion never
   before seen by me were spun everywhere and huge bats flapped their
   bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom

   of my exact age even down to days and hours i kept a most careful
   record for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the
   library tolled off so much more of my doomed existence at length i
   approached that time which i had so long viewed with apprehension
   since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before
   they reached the exact age of the comte henri at his end i was every
   moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death in what
   strange form the curse should overtake me i knew not; but i was
   resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive
   victim with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old
   chateau and its contents

   it was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the
   deserted portion of the castle less than a week before that fatal hour
   which i felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth beyond
   which i could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw
   breath that i came upon the culminating event of my whole life i had
   spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half
   ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient
   turrets as the afternoon progressed i sought the lower levels
   descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of
   confinement or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder as
   i slowly traversed the nitreencrusted passageway at the foot of the
   last staircase the paving became very damp and soon i saw by the
   light of my flickering torch that a blank waterstained wall impeded
   my journey turning to retrace my steps my eye fell upon a small
   trapdoor with a ring which lay directly beneath my feet pausing i
   succeeded with difficulty in raising it whereupon there was revealed a
   black aperture exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to
   sputter and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of
   stone steps as soon as the torch which i lowered into the repellent
   depths burned freely and steadily i commenced my descent the steps
   were many and led to a narrow stoneflagged passage which i knew must
   be far underground this passage proved of great length and terminated
   in a massive oaken door dripping with the moisture of the place and
   stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it ceasing after a time my
   efforts in this direction i had proceeded back some distance toward
   the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most
   profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind
   without warning i heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open
   upon its rusted hinges my immediate sensations are incapable of
   analysis to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as i had
   deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit
   produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description when at
   last i turned and faced the seat of the sound my eyes must have
   started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld there in the
   ancient gothic doorway stood a human figure it was that of a man clad
   in a skullcap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour his long hair
   and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue and of
   incredible profusion his forehead high beyond the usual dimensions;
   his cheeks deep sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles; and his hands
   long clawlike and gnarled were of such a deathly marblelike
   whiteness as i have never elsewhere seen in man his figure lean to
   the proportions of a skeleton was strangely bent and almost lost
   within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment but strangest of
   all were his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness; profound in
   expression of understanding yet inhuman in degree of wickedness these
   were now fixed upon me piercing my soul with their hatred and rooting
   me to the spot whereon i stood at last the figure spoke in a rumbling
   voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent
   malevolence the language in which the discourse was clothed was that
   debased form of latin in use amongst the more learned men of the middle
   ages and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works
   of the old alchemists and demonologists the apparition spoke of the
   curse which had hovered over my house told me of my coming end dwelt
   on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old michel mauvais and
   gloated over the revenge of charles le sorcier he told me how the
   young charles had escaped into the night returning in after years to
   kill godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which
   had been his fathers at his assassination; how he had secretly
   returned to the estate and established himself unknown in the even
   then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous
   narrator; how he had seized robert son of godfrey in a field forced
   poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of thirtytwo
   thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse at this
   point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of
   all how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le
   sorcier must in the course of nature have died for the man digressed
   into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards
   father and son speaking most particularly of the researches of charles
   le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook
   of it eternal life and youth

   his enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible
   eyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them but suddenly the
   fiendish glare returned and with a shocking sound like the hissing of
   a serpent the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of
   ending my life as had charles le sorcier six hundred years before
   ended that of my ancestor prompted by some preserving instinct of
   selfdefense i broke through the spell that had hitherto held me
   immovable and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my
   existence i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the
   passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid
   scene with a ghastly radiance the shriek of fright and impotent malice
   emitted by the wouldbe assassin proved too much for my already shaken
   nerves and i fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint

   when at last my senses returned all was frightfully dark and my mind
   remembering what had occurred shrank from the idea of beholding more;
   yet curiosity overmastered all who i asked myself was this man of
   evil and how came he within the castle walls? why should he seek to
   avenge the death of poor michel mauvais and how had the curse been
   carried on through all the long centuries since the time of charles le
   sorcier? the dread of years was lifted off my shoulders for i knew
   that he whom i had felled was the source of all my danger from the
   curse; and now that i was free i burned with the desire to learn more
   of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries and made
   of my own youth one longcontinued nightmare determined upon further
   exploration i felt in my pockets for flint and steel and lit the
   unused torch which i had with me first of all the new light revealed
   the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger the
   hideous eyes were now closed disliking the sight i turned away and
   entered the chamber beyond the gothic door here i found what seemed
   much like an alchemists laboratory in one corner was an immense pile
   of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the
   torch it may have been gold but i did not pause to examine it for i
   was strangely affected by that which i had undergone at the farther
   end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many
   wild ravines of the dark hillside forest filled with wonder yet now
   realizing how the man had obtained access to the chateau i proceeded
   to return i had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with
   averted face but as i approached the body i seemed to hear emanating
   from it a faint sound as though life were not yet wholly extinct
   aghast i turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the
   floor

   then all at once the horrible eyes blacker even than the seared face
   in which they were set opened wide with an expression which i was
   unable to interpret the cracked lips tried to frame words which i
   could not well understand once i caught the name of charles le
   sorcier and again i fancied that the words years and curse issued
   from the twisted mouth still i was at a loss to gather the purport of
   his disconnected speech at my evident ignorance of his meaning the
   pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me until helpless as i
   saw my opponent to be i trembled as i watched him

   suddenly the wretch animated with his last burst of strength raised
   his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement then as i
   remained paralyzed with fear he found his voice and in his dying
   breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my
   days and my nights fool he shrieked can you not guess my secret?
   have you no brain whereby you may recognize the will which has through
   six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house? have i
   not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? know you not how the
   secret of alchemy was solved? i tell you it is i! i! i! that have
   lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge for i am charles le
   sorcier!

   the allowable rhyme  (1915)

          sed ubi plira nitent in carmine non ego paucis offendar
          maculis horace

   the poetical tendency of the present and of the preceding century has
   been divided in a manner singularly curious one loud and conspicuous
   faction of bards giving way to the corrupt influences of a decaying
   general culture seems to have abandoned all the properties of
   versification and reason in its mad scramble after sensational novelty;
   whilst the other and quieter school constituting a more logical
   evolution from the poesy of the georgian period demands an accuracy of
   rhyme and metre unknown even to the polished artists of the age of
   pope

   the rational contemporary disciple of the nine justly ignoring the
   dissonant shrieks of the radicals is therefore confronted with a grave
   choice of technique may he retain the liberties of imperfect or
   allowable rhyming which were enjoyed by his ancestors or must he
   conform to the new ideals of perfection evolved during the past
   century? the writer of this article is frankly an archaist in verse he
   has not scrupled to rhyme tossd with coast come with rome or
   home with gloom in his very latest published efforts thereby
   proclaiming his maintenance of the oldfashioned pets as models; but
   sound modern criticism proceeding from mr rheinhart kleiner and from
   other sources which must needs command respect has impelled him there
   to rehearse the question for public benefit and particularly to
   present his own side attempting to justify his adherence to the style
   of two centuries ago

   the earliest english attempts at rhyming probably included words whose
   agreement is so slight that it deserves the name of mere assonance
   rather than that of actual rhyme thus in the original ballad of
   chevychase we encounter king and within supposedly rhymed
   whilst in the similar battle of otterbourne we behold long rhymed
   with down ground with agurstonne and name with again in
   the ballad of sir patrick spense morn and storm and deep and
   feet are rhymed but the infelicities were obviously the result not
   of artistic negligence but of plebeian ignorance since the old
   ballads were undoubtedly the careless products of a peasant minstrelsy
   in chaucer a poet of the court the allowable rhyme is but
   infrequently discovered hence we may assume that the original ideal in
   english verse was the perfect rhyming sound

   spenser uses allowable rhymes giving in one of his characteristic
   stanzas the three distinct sounds of lord adord and word all
   supposed to rhyme; but of his pronunciation we know little and may
   justly guess that to the ears of his contemporaries the sounds were not
   conspicuously different ben johnsons employment of imperfect rhyming
   was much like spensers; moderate and partially to be excused on
   account of a chaotic pronunciation the better poets of the restoration
   were also sparing of allowable rhymes; cowley waller marvell and
   many others being quite regular in this respect

   it was therefore upon a world unprepared that samuel butler burst forth
   with his immortal hudibras whose comical familiarity of diction is
   in grotesqueness surpassed only by its clever licentiousness of
   rhyming butlers wellknown double rhymes are of necessity forced and
   inexact and in ordinary single rhymes he seems to have had no more
   regard for precision vowd and would talisman and slain
   restores and devours are a few specimens selected at random

   close after butler came jon oldham a satirist whose force and
   brilliance gained him universal praise and whose enormous crudity both
   in rhyme and in metre was forgiven amidst the splendor of his attacks
   oldham was almost absolutely ungoverned by the demands of the ear and
   perpetrated such atrocious rhymes as heads and besides devise
   and this again and sin tool and foul end and designd
   and even prays and cause

   the glorious dryden refiner and purifier of english verse did less
   for rhyme than he did for metre though nowhere attaining the
   extravagances of his friend oldham he lent the sanction of his great
   authority to rhymes which dr johnson admits are open to objection
   but one vast difference betwixt dryden and his loose predecessors must
   be observed dryden had so far improved metrical cadence that the
   final syllables of heroic couplets stood out in especial eminence
   displaying and emphasizing every possible similarity of sound; that is
   lending to sounds in the first place approximately similar the added
   similarity caused by the new prominence of their perfectly
   corresponding positions in their respective lines

   it were needless to dwell upon the rhetorical polish of the age
   immediately succeeding drydens so far as english versification is
   concerned pope was the world and all the world was pope dryden had
   founded a new school of verse but the development and ultimate
   perfections of this art remained for the sickly lad who before the age
   of twelve begged to be taken to wills coffeehouse that he might
   obtain a personal view of the aged dryden his idol and model
   delicately attuned to the subtlest harmonies of poetical construction
   alexander pope brought english prosody to its zenith and still stands
   alone on the heights yet he exquisite master of verse that he was
   frowned not upon imperfect rhymes provided they were set in faultless
   metre though most of his allowable rhymes are merely variations in the
   breadth and nature of vowel sounds he in one instance departs far
   enough from rigid perfection to rhyme the words vice and destroys
   yet who can take offence? the unvarying ebb and flow of the refined
   metrical impulse conceals and condones all else

   every argument by which english blank verse or spanish assonant verse
   is sustained may with greater force be applied to the allowable rhyme
   metre is the real essential of poetical technique and when two sounds
   of substantial resemblance are so placed that one follows the other in
   a certain measured relation the normal ear cannot without cavilling
   find fault with a slight want of identity in the respective dominant
   vowels the rhyming of a long vowel with a short one is common in all
   the georgian poets and when well recited cannot but be overlooked
   amidst the general flow of the verse; as for instance the following
   from pope:

          but thinks admitted to that equal sky
          his faithful dog shall bear him company

   of like nature is the rhyming of actually different vowels whose sounds
   are when pronounced in animated oration by no means dissimilar out
   of verse such words as join and line are quite unlike but pope
   well rhymes them when he writes:

          while expletives their feeble aid do join
          and ten low words oft creep in one dull line

   it is the final consonantal sound in rhyming which can never vary
   this above all else gives the desired similarity syllables which
   agree in vowels but not in the final consonants are not rhymes at all
   but simply assonants yet such is the inconsistent carelessness of the
   average modern writer that he often uses mere assonants to a greater
   extent than his fathers ever employed actually allowable rhymes the
   writer in his critical duties has more than once been forced to point
   out the attempted rhyming of such words as fame and lane task
   and glass or feels and yields and in view of these impossible
   combinations he cannot blame himself very seriously for rhyming art
   and shot in the march conservative; for this pair of words have at
   least identical consonants at the end

   that allowable rhymes have real advantages of a positive sort is an
   opinion by no means lightly to be denied the monotony of a long heroic
   poem may often be pleasantly relieved by judicious interruptions in the
   perfect successions of rhymes just as the metre may sometimes be
   adorned with occasional triplets and alexandrines another advantage is
   the greater latitude allowed for the expression of thought how
   numerous are the writers who from restriction to perfect rhyming are
   frequently compelled to abandon a neat epigram or brilliant
   antithesis which allowable rhyme would easily permit or else to
   introduce a dull expletive merely to supply a desired rhyme!

   but a return to historical considerations shows us only too clearly the
   logical trend of taste and the reason mr kleiners demand for
   absolute perfection is no idle cry in oliver goldsmith there arose one
   who though retaining the familiar classical diction of pope yet
   advanced further still toward what he deemed ideal polish by virtually
   abandoning the allowable rhyme in unvaried exactitude run the couplets
   of the traveler and of the deserted village and none can deny to
   them a certain urbanity which pleases the critical ear with but little
   less precision are molded the simple rhymes of cowper whilst the
   pompous erasmus darwin likewise shows more attention to identity of
   sound than do the queen anne bards giffords translations of juvenal
   and persius show to an almost equal degree the tendency of the age and
   campbell crabbe wordsworth byron keats and thomas moore are all
   inclined to refrain from the liberties practiced by those of former
   times to deny the importance of such a widespread change of technique
   is fruitless for its existence argues for its naturalness the best
   critics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demand perfect
   rhyming and no aspirant for fame can afford to depart from a standard
   so universal it is evidently the true goal of the english as well as
   of the french bard; the goal from which we are but temporarily
   deflected during the preceding age

   but exceptions should and must be made in the case of a few who have
   somehow absorbed the atmosphere of other days and who long in their
   hearts for the stately sound of the old classic cadences well may
   their predilection for imperfect rhyming be discouraged to a limited
   extent but to chain them wholly to modern rules would be barbarous
   every limited mind demands a certain freedom of expression and the man
   who cannot express himself satisfactorily without the stimulation
   derived from the spirited mode of two centuries ago should certainly be
   permitted to follow without undue restraint a practice so harmless so
   free from essential error and so sanctioned by precedent as that of
   employing in his poetical compositions the smooth and inoffensive
   allowable rhyme

   there was no hand to hold me back
   that night i found the ancient track
   over the hill and strained to see
   the fields that teased my memory
   this tree that wall  i knew them well
   and all the roofs and orchards fell
   familiarly upon my mind
   as from a past not far behind
   i knew what shadows would be cast
   as the late moon came up at last
   from back of zamans hill and how
   the vale would shine three hours from now
   and when the path grew steep and high
    and seemed to end against the sky
   i had no fear of what might rest
   beyond that silhouetted crest
   straight on i walked while all the night
   grew pale with phosphorescent light
   and wall and farmhouse gable glowed
   unearthly by the climbing road
   there was the milestone that i knew
   two miles to dunwich  now the view
   of distant spire and roofs would dawn
   with ten more upward paces gone

   the was no hand to hold me back
   that night i found the ancient track
   and reached the crest to see outspread
   a valley of the lost and dead;
   and over zamans hill the horn
   of a malignant moon was born
   to light the weeds and vines that grew
   on ruined walls i never knew
   the foxfire glowed in field and bog
   and unknown waters spewed a fog
   whose curling talons mocked the thought
   that i had ever known this spot
   too well i saw from the mad scene
   that my loved past had never been 
   nor was i now upon the trail
   descending to that long dead vale
   around was fog  ahead the spray
   of starstreams in the milky way
   there was no hand to hold me back
   that night i found the ancient track

   the battle that ended the century  (1934)
   by howard phillips lovecraft
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   this was sent anonymously to members of the lovecraft circle (friends
   and correspondants of h p lovecraft it contains pseudonymous
   references to them) in mid1934 lovecraft denied writing this piece
   although he was belived to be at least one of the authors by august
   derleth clark ashton smith and others
   227476the battle that ended the centuryhoward phillips lovecraft1934

   on the eve of the year 2001 a vast crowd of interested spectators were
   present amidst the romantic ruins of cohens garage on the former site
   of new york to witness a fistic encounter between two renowned
   champions of the strangestory firmamenttwogun bob^[1] the terror
   of the plains and knockout bernie^[2] the wild wolf of west shokan
   [the wolf was fresh from his correspondence course in physical
   training sold to him by mr arthur leeds] before the battle the
   auguries were determined by the venerated thibetan lama bill lum
   li^[3] who evoked the primal serpentgod of valusia and found
   unmistakable signs of victory for both sides creampuffs were
   inattentively vended by wladislaw brenryk^[4]the partakers being
   treated by the official surgeons drs d h killer^[5] and m gin
   brewery^[6]

   the gong was sounded at 39 oclock after which the air grew red with
   the gore of battle lavishly flung about by the mighty texas
   slaughterer very shortly the first actual damage occurredthe
   loosening of several teeth in both participants one bouncing out from
   the wolfs mouth after a casual tap from twogun described a parabola
   toward yucatan; being retrieved in a hasty expedition by messrs a
   hijacked barrell^[7] and g a scotland^[8] this incident was used by
   the eminent sociologist and expoet frank chimesleep short jr^[9] as
   the basis of a ballad of proletarian propaganda with three
   intentionally defective lines meanwhile a potentate from a
   neighbouring kingdom the effjay of akkamin^[10] (also known to himself
   as an amateur critic) expressed his frenzied disgust at the technique
   of the combatants at the same time peddling photographs of the
   fighters (with himself in the foreground) at five cents each

   in round two the shokan soakers sturdy right crashed through the
   texans ribs and became entangled in sundry viscera; thereby enabling
   two gun to get in several telling blows on his opponents unprotected
   chin bob was greatly annoyed by the effeminate squeamishness shewn by
   several onlookers as muscles glands gore and bits of flesh were
   spattered over the ringside during this round the eminent
   magazinecover anatomist mrs m blunderage^[11] portrayed the battlers
   as a pair of spirited nudes behind a thin veil of conveniently curling
   tobaccosmoke while the late mr c halfcent^[12] provided a sketch of
   three chinamen clad in silk hats and galoshesthis being his own
   original conception of the affray among the amateur sketches made was
   one by mr goofy hooey which later gained fame in the annual cubist
   exhibit as abstraction of an eradicated pudding

   in the third round the fight grew really rough; several ears and other
   appurtenances being wholly or partially detached from the frontier
   battler by the shokan shocker somewhat irritated twogun countered
   with some exceptionally sharp blows; severing many fragments from his
   aggressor who continued to fight with all his remaining members [at
   this stage the audience gave signs of much nervous
   excitementinstances of trampling and goring being frequent the more
   enthusiastic members were placed in the custody of mr harry brobst of
   the butler hospital for mental diseases]

   the entire affair was reported by mr w lablache talcum^[13] his copy
   being revised by horse power hateart^[14] throughout the event notes
   were taken by m le comte derlette^[15] for a 200volume novelcycle
   in the proustian manner to be entitled morning in september with
   illustrations by mrs blunderage mr j caesar warts^[16] frequently
   interviewed both battlers and all the more important spectators;
   obtaining as souvenirs (after a spirited struggle with the effjay) an
   autographed quarterrib of twoguns in an excellent state of
   preservation and three fingernails from the wild wolf lighting
   effects were supplied by the electrical testing laboratories under the
   supervision of h kanebrake^[17] the fourth round was prolonged eight
   hours at the request of the official artist mr h wanderer^[18] who
   wished to put certain shadings of fantasy into his representation of
   the wolfs depleted physiognomy which included several supernumerary
   details supplied by the imagination

   the climax came in round five when the texas tearers left passed
   entirely through battling bernies face and brought both sluggers to
   the mat this was adjudged a finish by the refereerobertieff
   essovitch karovsky^[19] the muscovite ambassadorwho in view of the
   shokan shockers gory state declared the latter to be essentially
   liquidated according to the marxian ideology the wild wolf entered an
   official protest which was promptly overruled on the ground that all
   the points necessary to technical death were theoretically present

   the gonfalons sounded a fanfare of triumph for the victor while the
   technically vanquished was committed to the care of the official
   mortician mr teaberry quince^[20] during the ceremonies the
   theoretical corpse strolled away for a bite of bologna but a tasteful
   cenotaph was supplied to furnish a focus for the rites the funeral
   procession was headed by a gaily bedecked hearse driven by malik taus
   the peacock sultan^[21] who sat on the box in west point uniform and
   turban and steered an expert course over several formidable hedges and
   stone walls about half way to the cemetery the cortege was rejoined by
   the corpse who sat beside sultan malik on the box and finished his
   bologna sandwichhis ample girth having made it impossible to enter
   the hastily selected cenotaph an appropriate dirge was rendered by
   maestro sing lee bawledout^[22] on the piccolo; messrs de silva
   brown and hendersons celebrated aria never swat a fly from the
   old cantata just imagine being chosen for the occasion the only
   detail omitted from the funeral was the interment which was
   interrupted by the disconcerting news that the official gatetakerthe
   celebrated financier and publisher ivar k rodent esq^[23]had
   absconded with the entire proceeds [this omission was regretted
   chiefly by the rev d vest wind who was thereby forced to leave
   unspoken a long and moving sermon revised expressly for the celebration
   from a former discourse delivered at the burial of a favourite horse]

   mr talcums report of the event illustrated by the wellknown artist
   klarkashton^[24] (who esoterically depicted the fighters as boneless
   fungi) was printed after repeated rejections by the discriminating
   editor of the windy city grabbag^[25]as a broadside by w peter
   chef^[26] [ with typographical supervision by vrest orton] this
   through the efforts of otis adelbert kline^[27] was finally placed on
   sale in the bookshop of smearum & weep three and a half copies finally
   being disposed of through the alluring catalogue description supplied
   by samuelus philanthropus esq^[28]

   in response to this wide demand the text was finally reprinted by mr
   de merit^[29] in the polychromatic pages of wursts weakly
   americana^[30] under the title has science been outmoded? or the
   millers in the garage no copies however remain in circulation;
   since all which were not snapped up by fanatical bibliophiles were
   seized by the police in connexion with the libel suit of the wild wolf
   who was after several appeals ending with the world court adjudged
   not only officially alive but the clear winner of the combat

   6459the beast in the caveh p lovecraft

   the horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon
   my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty i was lost
   completely hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the
   mammoth cave turn as i might in no direction could my straining
   vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me
   on the outward path that nevermore should i behold the blessed light
   of day or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world
   outside my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief
   hope had departed yet indoctrinated as i was by a life of
   philosophical study i derived no small measure of satisfaction from my
   unimpassioned demeanour; for although i had frequently read of the wild
   frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations i
   experienced none of these but stood quiet as soon as i clearly
   realised the loss of my bearings
         nor did the thought that i had probably wandered beyond the
   utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure
   even for a moment if i must die i reflected then was this terrible
   yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard
   might afford a conception which carried with it more of tranquillity
   than of despair
         starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this i was certain
   some i knew had gone mad under circumstances such as these but i
   felt that this end would not be mine my disaster was the result of no
   fault save my own since unknown to the guide i had separated myself
   from the regular party of sightseers; and wandering for over an hour
   in forbidden avenues of the cave had found myself unable to retrace
   the devious windings which i had pursued since forsaking my companions
         already my torch had begun to expire; soon i would be enveloped
   by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth
   as i stood in the waning unsteady light i idly wondered over the
   exact circumstances of my coming end i remembered the accounts which i
   had heard of the colony of consumptives who taking their residence in
   this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air
   of the underground world with its steady uniform temperature pure
   air and peaceful quiet had found instead death in strange and
   ghastly form i had seen the sad remains of their illmade cottages as
   i passed them by with the party and had wondered what unnatural
   influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert
   upon one as healthy and vigorous as i now i grimly told myself my
   opportunity for settling this point had arrived provided that want of
   food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life
         as the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity i
   resolved to leave no stone unturned no possible means of escape
   neglected; so summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs i set up
   a series of loud shoutings in the vain hope of attracting the
   attention of the guide by my clamour yet as i called i believed in
   my heart that my cries were to no purpose and that my voice magnified
   and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me
   fell upon no ears save my own
         all at once however my attention was fixed with a start as i
   fancied that i heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky
   floor of the cavern
         was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon? had then
   all my horrible apprehensions been for naught and was the guide
   having marked my unwarranted absence from the party following my
   course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth? whilst these
   joyful queries arose in my brain i was on the point of renewing my
   cries in order that my discovery might come the sooner when in an
   instant my delight was turned to horror as i listened; for my ever
   acute ear now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence
   of the cave bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and
   dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were not like those of any
   mortal man in the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region the
   tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and
   incisive blows these impacts were soft and stealthy as of the paws
   of some feline besides when i listened carefully i seemed to trace
   the falls of four instead of two feet
         i was now convinced that i had by my own cries aroused and
   attracted some wild beast perhaps a mountain lion which had
   accidentally strayed within the cave perhaps i considered the
   almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that
   of hunger; yet the instinct of selfpreservation never wholly dormant
   was stirred in my breast and though escape from the oncoming peril
   might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end i determined
   nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as i could
   command strange as it may seem my mind conceived of no intent on the
   part of the visitor save that of hostility accordingly i became very
   quiet in the hope that the unknown beast would in the absence of a
   guiding sound lose its direction as had i and thus pass me by but
   this hope was not destined for realisation for the strange footfalls
   steadily advanced the animal evidently having obtained my scent which
   in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as
   is that of the cave could doubtless be followed at great distance
         seeing therefore that i must be armed for defense against an
   uncanny and unseen attack in the dark i groped about me the largest of
   the fragments of rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of
   the cavern in the vicinity and grasping one in each hand for immediate
   use awaited with resignation the inevitable result meanwhile the
   hideous pattering of the paws drew near certainly the conduct of the
   creature was exceedingly strange most of the time the tread seemed to
   be that of a quadruped walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt
   hind and fore feet yet at brief and infrequent intervals i fancied
   that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion i wondered
   what species of animal was to confront me; it must i thought be some
   unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of
   the entrances of the fearful grotto with a lifelong confinement in its
   interminable recesses it doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish
   bats and rats of the cave as well as some of the ordinary fish that
   are wafted in at every freshet of green river which communicates in
   some occult manner with the waters of the cave i occupied my terrible
   vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alteration cave life might
   have wrought in the physical structure of the beast remembering the
   awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who
   had died after long residence in the cave then i remembered with a
   start that even should i succeed in felling my antagonist i should
   never behold its form as my torch had long since been extinct and i
   was entirely unprovided with matches the tension on my brain now
   became frightful my disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome
   shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me and that actually
   seemed to press upon my body nearer nearer the dreadful footfalls
   approached it seemed that i must give vent to a piercing scream yet
   had i been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing my voice
   could scarce have responded i was petrified rooted to the spot i
   doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the
   oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive now the steady
   pat pat of the steps was close at hand; now very close i could hear
   the laboured breathing of the animal and terrorstruck as i was i
   realised that it must have come from a considerable distance and was
   correspondingly fatigued suddenly the spell broke my right hand
   guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing threw with full force
   the sharpangled bit of limestone which it contained toward that point
   in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering and
   wonderful to relate it nearly reached its goal for i heard the thing
   jump landing at a distance away where it seemed to pause
         having readjusted my aim i discharged my second missile this
   time most effectively for with a flood of joy i listened as the
   creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently
   remained prone and unmoving almost overpowered by the great relief
   which rushed over me i reeled back against the wall the breathing
   continued in heavy gasping inhalations and expirations whence i
   realised that i had no more than wounded the creature and now all
   desire to examine the thing ceased at last something allied to
   groundless superstitious fear had entered my brain and i did not
   approach the body nor did i continue to cast stones at it in order to
   complete the extinction of its life instead i ran at full speed in
   what was as nearly as i could estimate in my frenzied condition the
   direction from which i had come suddenly i heard a sound or rather a
   regular succession of sounds in another instant they had resolved
   themselves into a series of sharp metallic clicks this time there was
   no doubt it was the guide and then i shouted yelled screamed even
   shrieked with joy as i beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and
   glimmering effulgence which i knew to be the reflected light of an
   approaching torch i ran to meet the flare and before i could
   completely understand what had occurred was lying upon the ground at
   the feet of the guide embracing his boots and gibbering despite my
   boasted reserve in a most meaningless and idiotic manner pouring out
   my terrible story and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with
   protestations of gratitude at length i awoke to something like my
   normal consciousness the guide had noted my absence upon the arrival
   of the party at the entrance of the cave and had from his own
   intuitive sense of direction proceeded to make a thorough canvass of
   bypassages just ahead of where he had last spoken to me locating my
   whereabouts after a quest of about four hours
         by the time he had related this to me i emboldened by his torch
   and his company began to reflect upon the strange beast which i had
   wounded but a short distance back in the darkness and suggested that
   we ascertain by the flashlights aid what manner of creature was my
   victim accordingly i retraced my steps this time with a courage born
   of companionship to the scene of my terrible experience soon we
   descried a white object upon the floor an object whiter even than the
   gleaming limestone itself cautiously advancing we gave vent to a
   simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment for of all the unnatural
   monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld this was in
   surpassing degree the strangest it appeared to be an anthropoid ape of
   large proportions escaped perhaps from some itinerant menagerie its
   hair was snowwhite a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a
   long existence within the inky confines of the cave but it was also
   surprisingly thin being indeed largely absent save on the head where
   it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in
   considerable profusion the face was turned away from us as the
   creature lay almost directly upon it the inclination of the limbs was
   very singular explaining however the alternation in their use which
   i had before noted whereby the beast used sometimes all four and on
   other occasions but two for its progress from the tips of the fingers
   or toes long ratlike claws extended the hands or feet were not
   prehensile a fact that i ascribed to that long residence in the cave
   which as i before mentioned seemed evident from the allpervading and
   almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy no
   tail seemed to be present
         the respiration had now grown very feeble and the guide had
   drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature
   when a sudden sound emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall
   unused the sound was of a nature difficult to describe it was not
   like the normal note of any known species of simian and i wonder if
   this unnatural quality were not the result of a long continued and
   complete silence broken by the sensations produced by the advent of
   the light a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first
   entrance into the cave the sound which i might feebly attempt to
   classify as a kind of deeptone chattering was faintly continued
         all at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the
   frame of the beast the paws went through a convulsive motion and the
   limbs contracted with a jerk the white body rolled over so that its
   face was turned in our direction for a moment i was so struck with
   horror at the eyes thus revealed that i noted nothing else they were
   black those eyes deep jetty black in hideous contrast to the
   snowwhite hair and flesh like those of other cave denizens they were
   deeply sunken in their orbits and were entirely destitute of iris as
   i looked more closely i saw that they were set in a face less
   prognathous than that of the average ape and infinitely less hairy
   the nose was quite distinct as we gazed upon the uncanny sight
   presented to our vision the thick lips opened and several sounds
   issued from them after which the thing relaxed in death
         the guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that
   the light shook fitfully casting weird moving shadows on the walls
         i made no motion but stood rigidly still my horrified eyes
   fixed upon the floor ahead
         the fear left and wonder awe compassion and reverence
   succeeded in its place for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure
   that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth
   the creature i had killed the strange beast of the unfathomed cave
   was or had at one time been a man!

   the book is an unfinished short story by american horror fiction writer
     h p lovecraft believed to have been written in late 1933 it was
   first published in the journal leaves in 1938 after lovecrafts death
        excerpted from the book (short story) on wikipedia the free

   my memories are very confused there is even much doubt as to where
   they begin; for at times i feel appalling vistas of years stretching
   behind me while at other times it seems as if the present moment were
   an isolated point in a grey formless infinity i am not even certain
   how i am communicating this message while i know i am speaking i have
   a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation
   will be needed to bear what i say to the points where i wish to be
   heard my identity too is bewilderingly cloudy i seem to have
   suffered a great shockperhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth
   of my cycles of unique incredible experience
         these cycles of experience of course all stem from that
   wormriddled book i remember when i found itin a dimly lighted place
   near the black oily river where the mists always swirl that place was
   very old and the ceilinghigh shelves full of rotting volumes reached
   back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves there were
   besides great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins;
   and it was in one of these heaps that i found the thing i never
   learned its title for the early pages were missing; but it fell open
   toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses
   reeling
         there was a formulaa sort of list of things to say and
   dowhich i recognized as something black and forbidden; something
   which i had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence
   and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the
   universes guarded secrets whose decaying texts i loved to absorb it
   was a keya guideto certain gateways and transitions of which
   mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young and which
   lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms
   of life and matter that we know not for centuries had any man recalled
   its vital substance or known where to find it but this book was very
   old indeed no printingpress but the hand of some halfcrazed monk
   had traced these ominous latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity
         i remember how the old man leered and tittered and made a
   curious sign with his hand when i bore it away he had refused to take
   pay for it and only long afterwards did i guess why as i hurried home
   through those narrow winding mistcloaked waterfront streets i had a
   frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding
   feet the centuried tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a
   fresh and morbid malignityas if some hitherto closed channel of evil
   understanding had abruptly been opened i felt that those walls and
   overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungoid plaster and
   timberwith eyelike diamondpaned windows that leeredcould hardly
   desist from advancing and crushing meyet i had read only the least
   fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing
   it away
         i remember how i read the book at lastwhitefaced and locked
   in the attic room that i had long devoted to strange searchings the
   great house was very still for i had not gone up till after midnight
   i think i had a family thenthough the details are very uncertainand
   i know there were many servants just what the year was i cannot say;
   for since then i have known many ages and dimensions and have had all
   my notions of time dissolved and refashioned it was by the light of
   candles that i readi recall the relentless dripping of the waxand
   there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries i
   seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness as if
   i feared to hear some very remote intruding note among them
         then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window
   that looked out high above the other roofs of the city it came as i
   droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay and i knew amidst my
   shudders what it meant for he who passes the gateways always wins a
   shadow and never again can he be alone i had evokedand the book was
   indeed all i had suspected that night i passed the gateway to a vortex
   of twisted time and vision and when morning found me in the attic room
   i saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which i had never seen
   before
         nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it mixed
   with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of
   the future and every oncefamiliar object loomed alien in the new
   perspective brought by my widened sight from then on i walked in a
   fantastic dream of unknown and halfknown shapes; and with each new
   gateway crossed the less plainly could i recognise the things of the
   narrow sphere to which i had so long been bound what i saw about me
   none else saw; and i grew doubly silent and aloof lest i be thought
   mad dogs had a fear of me for they felt the outside shadow which
   never left my side but still i read morein hidden forgotten books
   and scrolls to which my new vision led meand pushed through fresh
   gateways of space and being and lifepatterns toward the core of the
   unknown cosmos
         i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire
   on the floor and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous
   litany the messenger from tartary had brought the walls melted away
   and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with
   the needlelike pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me after a
   while there was utter blackness and then the light of myriad stars
   forming strange alien constellations finally i saw a greenlitten
   plain far below me and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city
   built in no fashion i had ever known or read or dreamed of as i
   floated closer to that city i saw a great square building of stone in
   an open space and felt a hideous fear clutching at me i screamed and
   struggled and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled
   flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor in that nights
   wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former
   nights wandering; but there was more of terror because i knew i was
   closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than i had ever been before
   thereafter i was more cautious with my incantations for i had no wish
   to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence
   i could never return

   12044the bride of the seah p lovecraft

   black loom the crags of the uplands behind me
   dark are the sands of the farstretching shore
   dim are the pathways and rocks that remind me
   sadly of years in the lost nevermore

   soft laps the ocean on wavepolishd boulder
   sweet is the sound and familiar to me;
   here with her head gently bent to my shoulder
   walkd i with unda the bride of the sea

   bright was the morn of my youth when i met her
   sweet as the breeze that blew oer the brine
   swift was i capturd in loves strongest fetter
   glad to be here and she glad to be mine

   never a question askd i where she wanderd
   never a question askd she of my birth:
   happy as children we thought not nor ponderd
   glad of the bounty of ocean and earth

   once when the moonlight playd soft mid the billows
   high on the cliff oer the waters we stood
   bound was her hair with a garland of willows
   pluckd by the fount in the birdhaunted wood

   strangely she gazd on the surges beneath her
   charmd with the sound or entrancd by the light:
   then did the waves a wild aspect bequeath her
   stern as the ocean and weird as the night

   coldly she left me astonishd and weeping
   standing alone mid the legions she blessd:
   down ever downward half gliding half creeping
   stole the sweet unda in oceanward quest

   calm grew the sea and tumultuous beating
   turnd to a ripple as unda the fair
   trod the wet sands in affectionate greeting
   beckond to me and no longer was there!

   long did i pace by the banks where she vanishd
   high climbd the moon and descended again
   grey broke the dawn till the sad night was banishd
   still achd my soul with its infinite pain

   all the wide world have i searchd for my darling;
   scourd the far desert and saild distant seas
   once on the wave while the tempest was snarling
   flashd a fair face that brought quiet and ease

   ever in restlessness onward i stumble
   seeking and pining scarce heeding my way
   now have i strayd where the wide waters rumble
   back to the scene of the lost yesterday

   lo! the red moon from the oceans low hazes
   rises in ominous grandeur to view;
   strange is its face as my torturd eye gazes
   oer the vast reaches of sparkle and blue

   straight from the moon to the shore where im sighing
   grows a bright bridge made of wavelets and beams
   frail it may be yet how simple the trying
   wandring from earth to the orb of sweet dreams

   what is yon face in the moonlight appearing;
   have i at last found the maiden that fled?
   out on the beambridge my footsteps are nearing
   her whose sweet beckoning hastens my tread

   currents surround me and drowsily swaying
   far on the moonpath i seek the sweet face
   eagerly hasting half panting half praying
   forward i reach for the vision of grace

   murmuring waters about me are closing
   soft the sweet vision advances to me
   done are my trials; my heart is reposing
   safe with my unda the bride of the sea

     of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a
     survival a survival of a hugely remote period when
     consciousness was manifested perhaps in shapes and forms long
     since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity forms of
     which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called
     them gods monsters mythical beings of all sorts and kinds

   the cats
   by h p lovecraft
   14867the catsh p lovecraft

   babels of blocks to the high heavens towering
   flames of futility swirling below;
   poisonous fungi in brick and stone flowering
   lanterns that shudder and deathlights that glow

   black monstrous bridges across oily rivers
   cobwebs of cable to nameless things spun;
   catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers
   streams of live foetor that rots in the sun

   colour and splendour disease and decaying
   shrieking and ringing and crawling insane
   rabbles exotic to strangergods praying
   jumbles of odour that stifle the brain

   legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal
   howling and lean in the glare of the moon
   screaming the future with mouthings infernal
   yelling the garden of plutos red rune

   tall towers and pyramids ivyd and crumbling
   bats that swoop low in the weedcumberd streets;
   bleak arkham bridges oer rivers whose rumbling
   joins with no voice as the thick horde retreats

   belfries that buckle against the moon totter
   caverns whose mouths are by mosses effacd
   and living to answer the wind and the water
   only the lean cats that howl in the wastes

   254the cats of ultharhp lovecraft

   it is said that in ulthar which lies beyond the river skai no man may
   kill a cat; and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who
   sitteth purring before the fire for the cat is cryptic and close to
   strange things which men cannot see he is the soul of antique
   aegyptus and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in meroe and ophir
   he is the kin of the jungles lords and heir to the secrets of hoary
   and sinister africa the sphinx is his cousin and he speaks her
   language; but he is more ancient than the sphinx and remembers that
   which she hath forgotten
         in ulthar before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats
   there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay
   the cats of their neighbors why they did this i know not; save that
   many hate the voice of the cat in the night and take it ill that cats
   should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight but whatever
   the reason this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and
   slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the
   sounds heard after dark many villagers fancied that the manner of
   slaying was exceedingly peculiar but the villagers did not discuss
   such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual
   expression on the withered faces of the two and because their cottage
   was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a
   neglected yard in truth much as the owners of cats hated these odd
   folk they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal
   assassins merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should
   stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees when through some
   unavoidable oversight a cat was missed and sounds heard after dark
   the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by thanking fate
   that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished for the
   people of ulthar were simple and knew not whence it is all cats first
   came
         one day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the
   narrow cobbled streets of ulthar dark wanderers they were and unlike
   the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year
   in the marketplace they told fortunes for silver and bought gay beads
   from the merchants what was the land of these wanderers none could
   tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers and that
   they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with
   human bodies and the heads of cats hawks rams and lions and the
   leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious
   disk betwixt the horns
         there was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or
   mother but only a tiny black kitten to cherish the plague had not
   been kind to him yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate
   his sorrow; and when one is very young one can find great relief in
   the lively antics of a black kitten so the boy whom the dark people
   called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his
   graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon
         on the third morning of the wanderers stay in ulthar menes
   could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the marketplace
   certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife and of sounds
   heard in the night and when he heard these things his sobbing gave
   place to meditation and finally to prayer he stretched out his arms
   toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand;
   though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand since
   their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the
   clouds were assuming it was very peculiar but as the little boy
   uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy
   nebulous figures of exotic things; of hybrid creatures crowned with
   hornflanked disks nature is full of such illusions to impress the
   imaginative
         that night the wanderers left ulthar and were never seen again
   and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the
   village there was not a cat to be found from each hearth the familiar
   cat had vanished; cats large and small black grey striped yellow
   and white old kranon the burgomaster swore that the dark folk had
   taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes kitten; and
   cursed the caravan and the little boy but nith the lean notary
   declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to
   suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold
   still no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little
   atal the innkeepers son vowed that he had at twilight seen all the
   cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees pacing very
   slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage two abreast as if
   in performance of some unheardof rite of beasts the villagers did not
   know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared
   that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death they preferred
   not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and
   repellent yard
         so ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people
   awakened at dawnbehold! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth!
   large and small black grey striped yellow and white none was
   missing very sleek and fat did the cats appear and sonorous with
   purring content the citizens talked with one another of the affair
   and marveled not a little old kranon again insisted that it was the
   dark folk who had taken them since cats did not return alive from the
   cottage of the ancient man and his wife but all agreed on one thing:
   that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink
   their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious and for two whole days
   the sleek lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food but only doze by
   the fire or in the sun
         it was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights
   were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees
   then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his
   wife since the night the cats were away in another week the
   burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely
   silent dwelling as a matter of duty though in so doing he was careful
   to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as
   witnesses and when they had broken down the frail door they found only
   this: two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor and a
   number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners
         there was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar
   zath the coroner disputed at length with nith the lean notary; and
   kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions even little
   atal the innkeepers son was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat
   as reward they talked of the old cotter and his wife of the caravan
   of dark wanderers of small menes and his black kitten of the prayer
   of menes and of the sky during that prayer of the doings of the cats
   on the night the caravan left and of what was later found in the
   cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard
         and in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is
   told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travelers in nir; namely
   that in ulthar no man may kill a cat

   lovecraft robert e howard and frank belknap long1935

   [c l moore]

   george campbell opened sleepfogged eyes upon darkness and lay gazing
   out of the tent flap upon the pale august night for some minutes before
   he roused enough even to wonder what had wakened him there was in the
   keen clear air of these canadian woods a soporific as potent as any
   drug campbell lay quiet for a moment sinking slowly back into the
   delicious borderlands of sleep conscious of an exquisite weariness an
   unaccustomed sense of muscles well used and relaxed now into perfect
   ease these were vacations most delightful moments after all  rest
   after toil in the clear sweet forest night

   luxuriously as his mind sank backward into oblivion he assured
   himself once more that three long months of freedom lay before him 
   freedom from cities and monotony freedom from pedagogy and the
   university and students with no rudiments of interest in the geology he
   earned his daily bread by dinning into their obdurate ears freedom
   from 

   abruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him somewhere outside
   the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed into his peace george
   campbell sat up jerkily and reached for his flashlight then he laughed
   and put it down again straining his eyes through the midnight gloom
   outside where among the tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous
   little night beast was prowling he stretched out a long arm and groped
   about among the rocks at the tent door for a missile his fingers
   closed on a large stone and he drew back his hand to throw

   but he never threw it it was such a queer thing he had come upon in
   the dark square crystal smooth obviously artificial with dull
   rounded corners the strangeness of its rock surfaces to his fingers
   was so remarkable that he reached again for his flashlight and turned
   its rays upon the thing he held

   all sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up in his
   idle groping it was clear as rock crystal this queer smooth cube
   quartz unquestionably but not in its usual hexagonal crystallized
   form somehow  he could not guess the method  it had been wrought
   into a perfect cube about four inches in measurement over each worn
   face for it was incredibly worn the hard hard crystal was rounded
   now until its corners were almost gone and the thing was beginning to
   assume the outlines of a sphere ages and ages of wearing years almost
   beyond counting must have passed over this strange clear thing

   but the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make out
   dimly in the heart of the crystal for imbedded in its center lay a
   little disc of a pale and nameless substance with characters incised
   deep upon its quartzenclosed surface wedgeshaped characters faintly
   reminiscent of cuneiform writing

   george campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the little
   enigma in his hands puzzling helplessly how could such a thing as
   this have imbedded in pure rock crystal? remotely a memory floated
   through his mind of ancient legends that called quartz crystals ice
   which had frozen too hard to melt again ice  and wedgeshaped
   cuneiforms  yes didnt that sort of writing originate among the
   sumerians who came down from the north in historys remotest beginnings
   to settle in the primitive mesopotamian valley? then hard sense
   regained control and he laughed quartz of course was formed in the
   earliest of earths geological periods when there was nothing anywhere
   but beat and heaving rock ice had not come for tens of millions of
   years after this thing must have been formed

   and yet  that writing manmade surely although its characters were
   unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at cuneiform shapes or could
   there in a paleozoic world have been things with a written language
   who might have graven these cryptic wedges upon the quartzenveloped
   disc he held? or  might a thing like this have fallen meteorlike out
   of space into the unformed rock of a still molten world? could it 

   then he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot at the
   luridness of his own imagination the silence and the solitude and the
   queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play tricks with his common
   sense he shrugged and laid the crystal down at the edge of his pallet
   switching off the light perhaps morning and a clear head would bring
   him an answer to the questions that seemed so insoluble now

   but sleep did not come easily for one thing it seemed to him as he
   flashed off the light that the little cube had shone for a moment as
   if with sustained light before it faded into the surrounding dark or
   perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had been only his dazzled eyes that
   seemed to see the light forsake it reluctantly glowing in the
   enigmatic deeps of the thing with queer persistence

   he lay there unquietly for a long while turning the unanswered
   questions over and over in his mind there was something about this
   crystal cube out of the unmeasured past perhaps from the dawn of all
   history that constituted a challenge that would not let him sleep

   [a merritt]

   he lay there it seemed to him for hours it had been the lingering
   light the luminescence that seemed so reluctant to die which held his
   mind it was as though something in the heart of the cube had awakened
   stirred drowsily become suddenly alert  and intent upon him

   sheer fantasy this he stirred impatiently and flashed his light upon
   his watch close to one oclock; three hours more before the dawn the
   beam fell and was focused upon the warm crystal cube he held it there
   closely for minutes he snapped it out then watched

   there was no doubt about it now as his eyes accustomed themselves to
   the darkness he saw that the strange crystal was glimmering with tiny
   fugitive lights deep within it like threads of sapphire lightnings
   they were at its center and they seemed to him to come from the pale
   disk with its disturbing markings and the disc itself was becoming
   larger  the markings shifting shapes  the cube was growing 
   was it illusion brought about by the tiny lightnings

   he heard a sound it was the very ghost of a sound like the ghosts of
   harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers he bent closer it
   came from the cube

   there was squeaking in the underbrush a flurry of bodies and an
   agonized wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly stilled some
   small tragedy of the wilderness killer and prey he stepped over to
   where it had been enacted but could see nothing he again snapped off
   the flash and looked toward his tent upon the ground was a pale blue
   glimmering it was the cube he stooped to pick it up; then obeying
   some obscure warning drew back his hand

   and again he saw its glow was dying the tiny sapphire lightnings
   flashing fitfully withdrawing to the disc from which they had come
   there was no sound from it

   he sat watching the luminescence glow and fade glow and fade but
   steadily becoming dimmer it came to him that two elements were
   necessary to produce the phenomenon the electric ray itself and his
   own fixed attention his mind must travel along the ray fix itself
   upon the cubes heart if its beat were to wax until  what?

   he felt a chill of spirit as though from contact with some alien
   thing it was alien he knew it; not of this earth not of earths
   life he conquered his shrinking picked up the cube and took it into
   the tent it was neither warm nor cold; except for its weight he would
   not have known he held it he put it upon the table keeping the torch
   turned from it; then stepped to the flap of the tent and closed it

   he went back to the table drew up the camp chair and turned the flash
   directly upon the cube focusing it so far as he could upon its heart
   he sent all his will all his concentration along it; focusing will
   and sight upon the disc as he had the light

   as though at command the sapphire lightnings burned forth they burst
   from the disc into the body of the crystal cube then beat back
   bathing the disc and the markings again these began to change
   shifting moving advancing and retreating in the blue gleaming they
   were no longer cuneiform they were things  objects

   he heard the murmuring music the plucked harp strings louder grew the
   sound and louder and now all the body of the cube vibrated to their
   rhythm the crystal walls were melting growing misty as though formed
   of the mist of diamonds and the disc itself was growing  the shapes
   shifting dividing and multiplying as though some door had been opened
   and into it companies of phantasms were pouring while brighter more
   bright grew the pulsing light

   he felt swift panic tried to withdraw sight and will dropped the
   flash the cube had no need now of the ray  and he could not
   withdraw  could not withdraw? why he himself was being sucked into
   that disc which was now a globe within which unnameable shapes danced
   to a music that bathed the globe with steady radiance

   there was no tent there was only a vast curtain of sparkling mist
   behind which shone the globe he felt himself drawn through that
   mist sucked through it as if by a mighty wind straight for the globe

   [h p lovecraft]

   as the mistblurred light of the sapphire suns grew more and more
   intense the outlines of the globe ahead wavered and dissolved to a
   churning chaos its pallor and its motion and its music all blended
   themselves with the engulfing mist bleaching it to a pale steelcolour
   and setting it undulantly in motion and the sapphire suns too melted
   imperceptibly into the greying infinity of shapeless pulsation

   meanwhile the sense of forward outward motion grew intolerably
   incredibly cosmically swift every standard of speed known to earth
   seemed dwarfed and campbell knew that any such flight in physical
   reality would mean instant death to a human being even as it was  in
   this strange hellish hypnosis or nightmare  the quasivisual
   impression of meteorlike hurtling almost paralyzed his mind though
   there were no real points of reference in the grey pulsing void he
   felt that he was approaching and passing the speed of light itself
   finally his consciousness did go under  and merciful blackness
   swallowed everything

   it was very suddenly and amidst the most impenetrable darkness that
   thoughts and ideas again came to george campbell of how many moments
    or years  or eternities  had elapsed since his flight through
   the grey void he could form no estimate he knew only that he seemed
   to be at rest and without pain indeed the absence of all physical
   sensation was the salient quality of his condition it made even the
   blackness seem less solidly black  suggesting as it did that he was
   rather a disembodied intelligence in a state beyond physical senses
   than a corporeal being with senses deprived of their accustomed objects
   of perception he could think sharply and quickly  almost
   preternaturally so  yet could form no idea whatsoever of his
   situation

   half by instinct he realised that he was not in his own tent true he
   might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world equally black; yet
   he knew this was not so there was no camp cot beneath him  he had no
   hands to feel the blankets and canvas surface and flashlight that ought
   to be around him  there was no sensation of cold in the air  no
   flap through which he could glimpse the pale night outside 
   something was wrong dreadfully wrong

   he cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube which had
   hypnotised him  of that and all which had followed he had known
   that his mind was going yet had been unable to draw back at the last
   moment there had been a shocking panic fear  a subconscious fear
   beyond even that caused by the sensation of daemonic flight it had
   come from some vague flash or remote recollection  just what he
   could not at once tell some cellgroup in the back of his head had
   seemed to find a cloudily familiar quality in the cube  and that
   familiarity was fraught with dim terror now he tried to remember what
   the familiarity and the terror were

   little by little it came to him once  long ago in connection with
   his geological lifework  he had read of something like that cube it
   had to do with those debatable and disquieting clay fragments called
   the eltdown shards dug up from precarboniferous strata in southern
   england thirty years before their shape and markings were so queer
   that a few scholars hinted at artificiality and made wild conjectures
   about them and their origin they came clearly from a time when no
   human beings could exist on the globe  but their contours and
   figurings were damnably puzzling that was how they got their name

   it was not however in the writings of any sober scientist that
   campbell had seen that reference to a crystal discholding globe the
   source was far less reputable and infinitely more vivid about 1912 a
   deeply learned sussex clergyman of occultist leanings  the reverend
   arthur brooke wintershall  had professed to identify the markings on
   the eltdown shards with some of the socalled prehuman hieroglyphs
   persistently cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical
   circles and had published at his own expense what purported to be a
   translation of the primal and baffling inscriptions  a
   translation still quoted frequently and seriously by occult writers
   in this translation  a surprisingly long brochure in view of the
   limited number of shards existing  had occurred the narrative
   supposedly of prehuman authorship containing the now frightening
   reference

   as the story went there dwelt on a world  and eventually on
   countless other worlds  of outer space a mighty order of wormlike
   beings whose attainments and whose control of nature surpassed anything
   within the range of terrestrial imagination they had mastered the art
   of interstellar travel early in their career and had peopled every
   habitable planet in their own galaxy  killing off the races they
   found

   beyond the limits of their own galaxy  which was not ours  they
   could not navigate in person; but in their quest for knowledge of all
   space and time they discovered a means of spanning certain
   transgalactic gulfs with their minds they devised peculiar objects 
   strangely energized cubes of a curious crystal containing hypnotic
   talismen and enclosed in spaceresisting spherical envelopes of an
   unknown substance  which could be forcibly expelled beyond the limits
   of their universe and which would respond to the attraction of cool
   solid matter only

   these of which a few would necessarily land on various inhabited
   worlds in outside universes formed the etherbridges needed for mental
   communication atmospheric friction burned away the protecting
   envelope leaving the cube exposed and subject to discovery by the
   intelligent minds of the world where it fell by its very nature the
   cube would attract and rivet attention this when coupled with the
   action of light was sufficient to set its special properties working

   the mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the power of
   the disc and would be sent on a thread of obscure energy to the place
   whence the disc had come  the remote world of the wormlike space
   explorers across stupendous galactic abysses received in one of the
   machines to which each cube was attuned the captured mind would remain
   suspended without body or senses until examined by one of the dominant
   race then it would by an obscure process of interchange be pumped of
   all its contents the investigators mind would now occupy the strange
   machine while the captive mind occupied the interrogators wormlike
   body then in another interchange the interrogators mind would leap
   across boundless space to the captives vacant and unconscious body on
   the transgalactic world  animating the alien tenement as best it
   might and exploring the alien world in the guise of one of its
   denizens

   when done with exploration the adventurer would use the cube and its
   disc in accomplishing his return  and sometimes the captured mind
   would be restored safely to its own remote world not always however
   was the dominant race so kind sometimes when a potentially important
   race capable of space travel was found the wormlike folk would employ
   the cube to capture and annihilate minds by the thousands and would
   extirpate the race for diplomatic reasons  using the exploring minds
   as agents of destruction

   in other cases sections of the wormfolk would permanently occupy a
   transgalactic planet  destroying the captured minds and wiping out
   the remaining inhabitants preparatory to settling down in unfamiliar
   bodies never however could the parent civilization be quite
   duplicated in such a case; since the new planet would not contain all
   the materials necessary for the wormraces arts the cubes for
   example could be made only on the home planet

   only a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a landing and
   response on an inhabited world  since there was no such thing as
   aiming them at goals beyond sight or knowledge only three ran the
   story had ever landed on peopled worlds in our own particular
   universe one of these had struck a planet near the galactic rim two
   thousand billion years ago while another had lodged three billion
   years ago on a world near the centre of the galaxy the third  and
   the only one ever known to have invaded the solar system  had reached
   our own earth 150000000 years ago

   it was with this latter that dr wintershalls translation chiefly
   dealt when the cube struck the earth he wrote the ruling terrestrial
   species was a huge coneshaped race surpassing all others before or
   since in mentality and achievements this race was so advanced that it
   had actually sent minds abroad in both space and time to explore the
   cosmos hence recognised something of what had happened when the cube
   fell from the sky and certain individuals had suffered mental change
   after gazing at it

   realising that the changed individuals represented invading minds the
   races leaders had them destroyed  even at the cost of leaving the
   displaced minds exiled in alien space they had had experience with
   even stranger transitions when through a mental exploration of space
   and time they formed a rough idea of what the cube was they carefully
   hid the thing from light and sight and guarded it as a menace they
   did not wish to destroy a thing so rich in later experimental
   possibilities now and then some rash unscrupulous adventurer would
   furtively gain access to it and sample its perilous powers despite the
   consequences  but all such cases were discovered and safely and
   drastically dealt with

   of this evil meddling the only bad result was that the wormlike
   outside race learned from the new exiles what had happened to their
   explorers on earth and conceived a violent hatred of the planet and
   all its lifeforms they would have depopulated it if they could and
   indeed sent additional cubes into space in the wild hope of striking it
   by accident in unguarded places  but that accident never came to
   pass

   the coneshaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube in a
   special shrine as a relique and basis for experiments till after aeons
   it was lost amidst the chaos of war and the destruction of the great
   polar city where it was guarded when fifty million years ago the
   beings sent their minds ahead into the infinite future to avoid a
   nameless peril of inner earth the whereabouts of the sinister cube
   from space were unknown

   this much according to the learned occultist the eltdown shards had
   said what now made the account so obscurely frightful to campbell was
   the minute accuracy with which the alien cube had been described every
   detail tallied  dimensions consistency heiroglyphed central disc
   hypnotic effects as he thought the matter over and over amidst the
   darkness of his strange situation he began to wonder whether his whole
   experience with the crystal cube  indeed its very existence  were
   not a nightmare brought on by some freakish subconscious memory of this
   old bit of extravagant charlatanic reading if so though the
   nightmare must still be in force; since his present apparently bodiless
   state had nothing of normality in it

   of the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection campbell
   could form no estimate everything about his state was so unreal that
   ordinary dimensions and measurements became meaningless it seemed an
   eternity but perhaps it was not really long before the sudden
   interruption came what happened was as strange and inexplicable as the
   blackness it succeeded there was a sensation  of the mind rather than
   of the body  and all at once campbell felt his thoughts swept or
   sucked beyond his control in tumultuous and chaotic fashion

   memories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly all that he knew  all
   his personal background traditions experiences scholarship dreams
   ideas and inspirationswelled up abruptly and simultaneously with a
   dizzying speed and abundance which soon made him unable to keep track
   of any separate concept the parade of all his mental contents became
   an avalanche a cascade a vortex it was as horrible and vertiginous
   as his hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him
   finally it sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh oblivion

   another measureless blank  and then a slow trickle of sensation this
   time it was physical not mental sapphire light and a low rumble of
   distant sound there were tactile impressions  he could realise that
   he was lying at full length on something though there was a baffling
   strangeness about the feel of his posture he could not reconcile the
   pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlines  or with the
   outlines of the human form at all he tried to move his arms but found
   no definite response to the attempt instead there were little
   ineffectual nervous twitches all over the area which seemed to mark his
   body

   he tried to open his eyes more widely but found himself unable to
   control their mechanism the sapphire light came in a diffused
   nebulous manner and could nowhere be voluntarily focussed into
   definiteness gradually though visual images began to trickle in
   curiously and indecisively the limits and qualities of vision were not
   those which he was used to but he could roughly correlate the
   sensation with what he had known as sight as this sensation gained
   some degree of stability campbell realised that he must still be in
   the throes of nightmare

   he seemed to be in a room of considerable extent  of medium height
   but with a large proportionate area on every side  and he could
   apparently see all four sides at once  were high narrowish slits
   which seemed to serve as combined doors and windows there were
   singular low tables or pedestals but no furniture of normal nature and
   proportions through the slits streamed floods of sapphire light and
   beyond them could be mistily seen the sides and roofs of fantastic
   buildings like clustered cubes on the walls  in the vertical panels
   between the slits  were strange markings of an oddly disquieting
   character it was some time before campbell understood why they
   disturbed him so  then he saw that they were in repeated instances
   precisely like some of the hieroglyphs on the crystal cubes disc

   the actual nightmare element though was something more than this it
   began with the living thing which presently entered through one of the
   slits advancing deliberately toward him and bearing a metal box of
   bizarre proportions and glassy mirrorlike surfaces for this thing
   was nothing human  nothing of earth  nothing even of mans myths
   and dreams it was a gigantic palegrey worm or centipede as large
   around as a man and twice as long with a disclike apparently
   eyeless ciliafringed head bearing a purple central orifice it glided
   on its rear pairs of legs with its fore part raised vertically  the
   legs or at least two pairs of them serving as arms along its spinal
   ridge was a curious purple comb and a fanshaped tail of some grey
   membrane ended its grotesque bulk there was a ring of flexible red
   spikes around its neck and from the twistings of these came clicking
   twanging sounds in measured deliberate rhythms

   here indeed was outré nightmare at its height  capricious fantasy
   at its apex but even this vision of delirium was not what caused
   george campbell to lapse a third time into unconsciousness it took one
   more thing  one final unbearable touch  to do that as the
   nameless worm advanced with its glistening box the reclining man
   caught in the mirrorlike surface a glimpse of what should have been
   his own body yet  horribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar
   sensations  it was not his own body at all that he saw reflected in
   the burnished metal it was instead the loathsome palegrey bulk of
   one of the great centipedes

   [robert e howard]

   from that final lap of senselessness he emerged with a full
   understanding of his situation his mind was imprisoned in the body of
   a frightful native of an alien planet while somewhere on the other
   side of the universe his own body was housing the monsters
   personality

   he fought down an unreasoning horror judged from a cosmic standpoint
   why should his metamorphosis horrify him? life and consciousness were
   the only realities in the universe form was unimportant his present
   body was hideous only according to terrestrial standards fear and
   revulsion were drowned in the excitement of titanic adventure

   what was his former body but a cloak eventually to be cast off at
   death anyway? he had no sentimental illusions about the life from which
   he had been exiled what had it ever given him save toil poverty
   continual frustration and repression? if this life before him offered
   no more at least it offered no less intuition told him it offered
   more  much more

   with the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its naked
   fundamentals he realized that he remembered with pleasure only the
   physical delights of his former life but he had long ago exhausted all
   the physical possibilities contained in that earthly body earth held
   no new thrills but in the possession of this new alien body he felt
   promises of strange exotic joys

   a lawless exultation rose in him he was a man without a world free of
   all conventions or inhibitions of earth or of this strange planet
   free of every artificial restraint in the universe he was a god! with
   grim amusement he thought of his body moving in earths business and
   society with all the while an alien monster staring out of the windows
   that were george campbells eyes on people who would flee if they knew

   let him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would earth and
   its races no longer had any meaning to george campbell there he had
   been one of a billion nonentities fixed in place by a mountainous
   accumulation of conventions laws and manners doomed to live and die
   in his sordid niche but in one blind bound he had soared above the
   commonplace this was not death but rebirth  the birth of a
   fullgrown mentality with a newfound freedom that made little of
   physical captivity on yekub

   he started yekub! it was the name of this planet but how had he
   known? then he knew as he knew the name of him whose body he occupied
   tothe memory deep grooved in tothes brain was stirring in him 
   shadows of the knowledge tothe had carved deep in the physical tissues
   of the brain they spoke dimly as implanted instincts to george
   campbell; and his human consciousness seized them and translated them
   to show him the way not only to safety and freedom but to the power
   his soul stripped to its primitive impulses craved not as a slave
   would he dwell on yekub but as a king! just as of old barbarians had
   sat on the throne of lordly empires

   for the first time he turned his attention to his surroundings he
   still lay on the couchlike thing in the midst of that fantastic room
   and the centipede man stood before him holding the polished metal
   object and clashing its neckspikes thus it spoke to him campbell
   knew and what it said he dimly understood through the implanted
   thought processes of tothe just as he knew the creature was yukth
   supreme lord of science

   but campbell gave no heed for he had made his desperate plan a plan
   so alien to the ways of yekub that it was beyond yukths comprehension
   and caught him wholly unprepared yukth like campbell saw the
   sharppointed metal shard on a nearby table but to yukth it was only a
   scientific implement he did not even know it could be used as a
   weapon campbells earthly mind supplied the knowledge and the action
   that followed driving tothes body into movements no man of yekub had
   ever made before

   campbell snatched the pointed shard and struck ripping savagely
   upward yukth reared and toppled his entrails spilling on the floor
   in an instant campbell was streaking for a door his speed was amazing
   exhilarating first fulfillment of the promise of novel physical
   sensations

   as he ran guided wholly by the instinctive knowledge implanted in
   tothes physical reflexes it was as if he were borne by a separate
   consciousness in his legs tothes body was bearing him along a route
   it had traversed ten thousand times when animated by tothes mind

   down a winding corridor he raced up a twisted stair through a carved
   door and the same instincts that had brought him there told him he had
   found what he sought he was in a circular room with a domed roof from
   which shone a livid blue light a strange structure rose in the middle
   of the rainbowhued floor tier on tier each of a separate vivid
   color the ultimate tier was a purple cone from the apex of which a
   blue smoky mist drifted upward to a sphere that poised in midair  a
   sphere that shone like translucent ivory

   this the deepgrooved memories of tothe told campbell was the god of
   yekub though why the people of yekub feared and worshipped it had been
   forgotten a million years a wormpriest stood between him and the
   altar which no hand of flesh had ever touched that it could be touched
   was a blasphemy that had never occurred to a man of yekub the
   wormpriest stood in frozen horror until campbells shard ripped the
   life out of him

   on his centipedelegs campbell clambered the tiered altar heedless of
   its sudden quiverings heedless of the change that was taking place in
   the floating sphere heedless of the smoke that now billowed out in
   blue clouds he was drunk with the feel of power he feared the
   superstitions of yekub no more than he feared those of earth with that
   globe in his hands he would be king of yekub the worm men would dare
   deny him nothing when he held their god as hostage he reached a hand
   for the ball  no longer ivoryhued but red as blood

   [frank belknap long]

   out of the tent into the pale august night walked the body of george
   campbell it moved with a slow wavering gait between the bodies of
   enormous trees over a forest path strewed with sweet scented pine
   needles the air was crisp and cold the sky was an inverted bowl of
   frosted silver flecked with stardust and far to the north the aurora
   borealis splashed streamers of fire

   the head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to side from
   the corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of amber froth
   which fluttered in the night breeze he walked upright at first as a
   man would walk but gradually as the tent receded his posture altered
   his torso began almost imperceptibly to slant and his limbs to
   shorten

   in a faroff world of outer space the centipede creature that was
   george campbell clasped to its bosom a god whose lineaments were red as
   blood and ran with insectlike quiverings across a rainbowhued hall
   and out through massive portals into the bright glow of alien suns

   weaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that suggested the
   awkward loping of a werebeast the body of george campbell was
   fulfilling a mindless destiny long clawtipped fingers dragged leaves
   from a carpet of odorous pine needles as it moved toward a wide expanse
   of gleaming water

   in the faroff extragalactic world of the worm people george
   campbell moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry down long
   fernplanted avenues holding aloft the round red god

   there was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the gleaming lake
   on earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in a body swayed by
   instinct human teeth sank into soft animal fur tore at black animal
   flesh a little silver fox sank its fangs in frantic retaliation into a
   furry human wrist and thrashed about in terror as its blood spurted
   slowly the body of george campbell arose its mouth splashed with fresh
   blood with upper limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of
   the lake

   as the variform creature that was george campbell crawled between the
   black blocks of stone thousands of wormshapes prostrated themselves in
   the scintillating dust before it a godlike power seemed to emanate
   from its weaving body as it moved with a slow undulant motion toward a
   throne of spiritual empire transcending all the sovereignties of earth

   a trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth near the
   tent where the wormcreature dwelt in the body of george campbell came
   to the gleaming waters of the lake and discerned something dark
   floating there he had been lost in the woods all night and weariness
   enveloped him like a leaden cloak in the pale morning light

   but the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore moving to the
   edge of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out toward the
   floating bulk slowly he pulled it to the shore

   far off in outer space the wormcreature holding the glowing red god
   ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation cassiopeia under
   an alien vault of hypersuns the great deity that he held aloft
   energized his worm tenement burning away in the white fire of a
   supermundane spirituality all animal dross

   on earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the blackened
   and hairy face of the drowned man it was a bestial face repulsively
   anthropoid in contour and from its twisted distorted mouth black
   ichor poured

   he who sought your body in the abysses of time will occupy an
   unresponsive tenement said the red god no spawn of yekub can
   control the body of a human

   on all earth living creatures rend one another and feast with
   unutterable cruelty on their kith and kin no wormmind can control a
   bestial manbody when it yearns to raven only manminds instinctively
   conditioned through the course of ten thousand generations can keep the
   human instincts in thrall your body will destroy itself on earth
   seeking the blood of its animal kin seeking the cool water where it
   can wallow at its ease seeking eventually destruction for the
   deathinstinct is more powerful in it than the instincts of life and it
   will destroy itself in seeking to return to the slime from which it
   sprang

   thus spoke the round red god of yekub in a faroff segment of the
   spacetime continuum to george campbell as the latter with all human
   desire purged away sat on a throne and ruled an empire of worms more
   wisely kindly and benevolently than any man of earth had ever ruled
   an empire of men

   12045the cityh p lovecraft

   it was golden and splendid
     that city of light;
   a vision suspended
     in deeps of the night;
   a region of wonder and glory whose temples were marble and white

   i remember the season
     it dawnd on my gaze;
   the mad time of unreason
     the brainnumbing days
   when winter whitesheeted and ghastly stalks onward to torture and
   craze

   more lovely than zion
     it shone in the sky
   when the beams of orion
     beclouded my eye
   bringing sleep that was filled with dim memries of moments obscure and
   gone by

   its mansions were stately
     with carvings made fair
   each rising sedately
     on terraces rare
   and the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles
   blossoming there

   the avenues lurd me
     with vistas sublime;
   tall arches assurd me
     that once on a time
   i had wanderd in rapture beneath them and baskd in the halcyon
   clime

   on the plazas were standing
     a sculpturd array;
   long bearded commanding
     grave men in their day
   but one stood dismantled and broken its bearded face battered away

   in that city effulgent
     no mortal i saw
   but my fancy indulgent
     to memorys law
   lingerd long on the forms in the plazas and eyed their stone features
   with awe

   i fannd the faint ember
     that glowd in my mind
   and strove to remember
     the aeons behind;
   to rove thro infinity freely and visit the past unconfind

   then the horrible warning
     upon my soul sped
   like the ominous morning
     that rises in red
   and in panic i flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead

    the colour out of space is a short story by american horror writer h
   p lovecraft written in march 1927 and initially published in amazing
      stories in september 1927 it became one of his most anthologized
   works  excerpted from the colour out of space on wikipedia the free

   west of arkham the hills rise wild and there are valleys with deep
   woods that no axe has ever cut there are dark narrow glens where the
   trees slope fantastically and where thin brooklets trickle without
   ever having caught the glint of sunlight on the gentler slopes there
   are farms ancient and rocky with squat mosscoated cottages brooding
   eternally over old new england secrets in the lee of great ledges; but
   these are all vacant now the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled
   sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs

   the old folk have gone away and foreigners do not like to live there
   frenchcanadians have tried it italians have tried it and the poles
   have come and departed it is not because of anything that can be seen
   or heard or handled but because of something that is imagined the
   place is not good for the imagination and does not bring restful
   dreams at night it must be this which keeps the foreigners away for
   old ammi pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the
   strange days ammi whose head has been a little queer for years is
   the only one who still remains or who ever talks of the strange days;
   and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields
   and the travelled roads around arkham

   there was once a road over the hills and through the valleys that ran
   straight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it
   and a new road was laid curving far toward the south traces of the old
   one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness and
   some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are
   flooded for the new reservoir then the dark woods will be cut down and
   the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will
   mirror the sky and ripple in the sun and the secrets of the strange
   days will be one with the deeps secrets; one with the hidden lore of
   old ocean and all the mystery of primal earth

   when i went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir
   they told me the place was evil they told me this in arkham and
   because that is a very old town full of witch legends i thought the
   evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through
   centuries the name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and
   theatrical and i wondered how it had come into the folklore of a
   puritan people then i saw that dark westward tangle of glens and
   slopes for myself and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own
   elder mystery it was morning when i saw it but shadow lurked always
   there the trees grew too thickly and their trunks were too big for
   any healthy new england wood there was too much silence in the dim
   alleys between them and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and
   mattings of infinite years of decay

   in the open spaces mostly along the line of the old road there were
   little hillside farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing
   sometimes with only one or two and sometimes with only a lone chimney
   or fastfilling cellar weeds and briers reigned and furtive wild
   things rustled in the undergrowth upon everything was a haze of
   restlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque
   as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry i did
   not wonder that the foreigners would not stay for this was no region
   to sleep in it was too much like a landscape of salvator rosa; too
   much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror

   but even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath i knew it the
   moment i came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other
   name could fit such a thing or any other thing fit such a name it was
   as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one
   particular region it must i thought as i viewed it be the outcome of
   a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of
   grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten
   by acid in the woods and fields? it lay largely to the north of the
   ancient road line but encroached a little on the other side i felt an
   odd reluctance about approaching and did so at last only because my
   business took me through and past it there was no vegetation of any
   kind on that broad expanse but only a fine grey dust or ash which no
   wind seemed ever to blow about the trees near it were sickly and
   stunted and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim as i
   walked hurriedly by i saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old
   chimney and cellar on my right and the yawning black maw of an
   abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the
   hues of the sunlight even the long dark woodland climb beyond seemed
   welcome in contrast and i marvelled no more at the frightened whispers
   of arkham people there had been no house or ruin near; even in the old
   days the place must have been lonely and remote and at twilight
   dreading to repass that ominous spot i walked circuitously back to the
   town by the curving road on the south i vaguely wished some clouds
   would gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had
   crept into my soul

   in the evening i asked old people in arkham about the blasted heath
   and what was meant by that phrase strange days which so many
   evasively muttered i could not however get any good answers except
   that all the mystery was much more recent than i had dreamed it was
   not a matter of old legendry at all but something within the lifetime
   of those who spoke it had happened in the eighties and a family had
   disappeared or was killed speakers would not be exact; and because
   they all told me to pay no attention to old ammi pierces crazy tales
   i sought him out the next morning having heard that he lived alone in
   the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very
   thick it was a fearsomely archaic place and had begun to exude the
   faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long
   only with persistent knocking could i rouse the aged man and when he
   shuffled timidly to the door i could tell he was not glad to see me he
   was not so feeble as i had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious
   way and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn
   and dismal

   not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales i feigned
   a matter of business; told him of my surveying and asked vague
   questions about the district he was far brighter and more educated
   than i had been led to think and before i knew it had grasped quite as
   much of the subject as any man i had talked with in arkham he was not
   like other rustics i had known in the sections where reservoirs were to
   be from him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and
   farmland to be blotted out though perhaps there would have been had
   not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake relief was all
   that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through
   which he had roamed all his life they were better under water
   nowbetter under water since the strange days and with this opening
   his husky voice sank low while his body leaned forward and his right
   forefinger began to point shakily and impressively

   it was then that i heard the story and as the rambling voice scraped
   and whispered on i shivered again and again despite the summer day
   often i had to recall the speaker from ramblings piece out scientific
   points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors
   talk or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity
   broke down when he was done i did not wonder that his mind had snapped
   a trifle or that the folk of arkham would not speak much of the
   blasted heath i hurried back before sunset to my hotel unwilling to
   have the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned
   to boston to give up my position i could not go into that dim chaos of
   old forest and slope again or face another time that grey blasted
   heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and
   stones the reservoir will soon be built now and all those elder
   secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms but even then i do
   not believe i would like to visit that country by nightat least not
   when the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink
   the new city water of arkham

   it all began old ammi said with the meteorite before that time there
   had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials and even then
   these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in
   the miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone altar
   older than the indians these were not haunted woods and their
   fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days then there had
   come that white noontide cloud that string of explosions in the air
   and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood and by night
   all arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and
   bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the nahum gardner place
   that was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to
   comethe trim white nahum gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and
   orchards

   nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone and had dropped
   in at ammi pierces on the way ammi was forty then and all the queer
   things were fixed very strongly in his mind he and his wife had gone
   with the three professors from miskatonic university who hastened out
   the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space
   and had wondered why nahum had called it so large the day before it
   had shrunk nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above
   the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic wellsweep in his
   front yard; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink its
   heat lingered persistently and nahum declared it had glowed faintly in
   the night the professors tried it with a geologists hammer and found
   it was oddly soft it was in truth so soft as to be almost plastic;
   and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the
   college for testing they took it in an old pail borrowed from nahums
   kitchen for even the small piece refused to grow cool on the trip
   back they stopped at ammis to rest and seemed thoughtful when mrs
   pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the
   bottom of the pail truly it was not large but perhaps they had taken
   less than they thought

   the day after thatall this was in june of 82the professors had
   trooped out again in a great excitement as they passed ammis they
   told him what queer things the specimen had done and how it had faded
   wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker the beaker had gone
   too and the wise men talked of the strange stones affinity for
   silicon it had acted quite unbelievably in that wellordered
   laboratory; doing nothing at all and shewing no occluded gases when
   heated on charcoal being wholly negative in the borax bead and soon
   proving itself absolutely nonvolatile at any producible temperature
   including that of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe on an anvil it appeared
   highly malleable and in the dark its luminosity was very marked
   stubbornly refusing to grow cool it soon had the college in a state of
   real excitement; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it
   displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum
   there was much breathless talk of new elements bizarre optical
   properties and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to
   say when faced by the unknown

   hot as it was they tested it in a crucible with all the proper
   reagents water did nothing hydrochloric acid was the same nitric
   acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid
   invulnerability ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things but
   recognized some solvents as i mentioned them in the usual order of use
   there were ammonia and caustic soda alcohol and ether nauseous carbon
   disulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew steadily
   less as time passed and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling
   there was no change in the solvents to shew that they had attacked the
   substance at all it was a metal though beyond a doubt it was
   magnetic for one thing; and after its immersion in the acid solvents
   there seemed to be faint traces of the widmanstätten figures found on
   meteoric iron when the cooling had grown very considerable the
   testing was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker that they
   left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work the
   next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace and only a
   charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been

   all this the professors told ammi as they paused at his door and once
   more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars
   though this time his wife did not accompany him it had now most
   certainly shrunk and even the sober professors could not doubt the
   truth of what they saw all around the dwindling brown lump near the
   well was a vacant space except where the earth had caved in; and
   whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before it was now
   scarcely five it was still hot and the sages studied its surface
   curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and
   chisel they gouged deeply this time and as they pried away the
   smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite
   homogeneous

   they had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured
   globule imbedded in the substance the colour which resembled some of
   the bands in the meteors strange spectrum was almost impossible to
   describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all
   its texture was glossy and upon tapping it appeared to promise both
   brittleness and hollowness one of the professors gave it a smart blow
   with a hammer and it burst with a nervous little pop nothing was
   emitted and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing it
   left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across and all
   thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing
   substance wasted away

   conjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional
   globules by drilling the seekers left again with their new
   specimenwhich proved however as baffling in the laboratory as its
   predecessor had been aside from being almost plastic having heat
   magnetism and slight luminosity cooling slightly in powerful acids
   possessing an unknown spectrum wasting away in air and attacking
   silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result it presented no
   identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the
   college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it it
   was nothing of this earth but a piece of the great outside; and as
   such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws

   that night there was a thunderstorm and when the professors went out
   to nahums the next day they met with a bitter disappointment the
   stone magnetic as it had been must have had some peculiar electrical
   property; for it had drawn the lightning as nahum said with a
   singular persistence six times within an hour the farmer saw the
   lightning strike the furrow in the front yard and when the storm was
   over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient wellsweep
   halfchoked with cavedin earth digging had borne no fruit and the
   scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment the failure was
   total; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and
   test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead that
   fragment lasted a week at the end of which nothing of value had been
   learned of it when it had gone no residue was left behind and in
   time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking
   eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside; that lone
   weird message from other universes and other realms of matter force
   and entity

   as was natural the arkham papers made much of the incident with its
   collegiate sponsoring and sent reporters to talk with nahum gardner
   and his family at least one boston daily also sent a scribe and nahum
   quickly became a kind of local celebrity he was a lean genial person
   of about fifty living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant
   farmstead in the valley he and ammi exchanged visits frequently as
   did their wives; and ammi had nothing but praise for him after all
   these years he seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had
   attracted and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks
   that july and august were hot; and nahum worked hard at his haying in
   the tenacre pasture across chapmans brook; his rattling wain wearing
   deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between the labour tired him more than
   it had in other years and he felt that age was beginning to tell on
   him

   then fell the time of fruit and harvest the pears and apples slowly
   ripened and nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never
   before the fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss
   and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the
   future crop but with the ripening came sore disappointment; for of all
   that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit
   to eat into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a
   stealthy bitterness and sickishness so that even the smallest of bites
   induced a lasting disgust it was the same with the melons and
   tomatoes and nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost quick to
   connect events he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil
   and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot
   along the road

   winter came early and was very cold ammi saw nahum less often than
   usual and observed that he had begun to look worried the rest of his
   family too seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady in
   their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events of
   the countryside for this reserve or melancholy no cause could be
   found though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health
   and a feeling of vague disquiet nahum himself gave the most definite
   statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain
   footprints in the snow they were the usual winter prints of red
   squirrels white rabbits and foxes but the brooding farmer professed
   to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement he
   was never specific but appeared to think that they were not as
   characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and
   foxes as they ought to be ammi listened without interest to this talk
   until one night when he drove past nahums house in his sleigh on the
   way back from clarks corners there had been a moon and a rabbit had
   run across the road and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than
   either ammi or his horse liked the latter indeed had almost run away
   when brought up by a firm rein thereafter ammi gave nahums tales more
   respect and wondered why the gardner dogs seemed so cowed and
   quivering every morning they had it developed nearly lost the spirit
   to bark

   in february the mcgregor boys from meadow hill were out shooting
   woodchucks and not far from the gardner place bagged a very peculiar
   specimen the proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a
   queer way impossible to describe while its face had taken on an
   expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before the boys were
   genuinely frightened and threw the thing away at once so that only
   their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside
   but the shying of the horses near nahums house had now become an
   acknowledged thing and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend
   was fast taking form

   people vowed that the snow melted faster around nahums than it did
   anywhere else and early in march there was an awed discussion in
   potters general store at clarks corners stephen rice had driven past
   gardners in the morning and had noticed the skunkcabbages coming up
   through the mud by the woods across the road never were things of such
   size seen before and they held strange colours that could not be put
   into any words their shapes were monstrous and the horse had snorted
   at an odour which struck stephen as wholly unprecedented that
   afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth and
   all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy
   world the bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned and it
   went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in nahums ground of
   course it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from
   the college had found that stone to be several farmers spoke about the
   matter to them

   one day they paid nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and
   folklore were very conservative in what they inferred the plants were
   certainly odd but all skunkcabbages are more or less odd in shape and
   odour and hue perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered
   the soil but it would soon be washed away and as for the footprints
   and frightened horsesof course this was mere country talk which such
   a phenomenon as the aërolite would be certain to start there was
   really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip for
   superstitious rustics will say and believe anything and so all through
   the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt only one of
   them when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a
   year and a half later recalled that the queer colour of that
   skunkcabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light
   shewn by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope and like the
   brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss the samples
   in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first though later
   they lost the property

   the trees budded prematurely around nahums and at night they swayed
   ominously in the wind nahums second son thaddeus a lad of fifteen
   swore that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the
   gossips would not credit this certainly however restlessness was in
   the air the entire gardner family developed the habit of stealthy
   listening though not for any sound which they could consciously name
   the listening was indeed rather a product of moments when
   consciousness seemed half to slip away unfortunately such moments
   increased week by week till it became common speech that something
   was wrong with all nahums folks when the early saxifrage came out it
   had another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunkcabbage
   but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it nahum
   took some blossoms to arkham and shewed them to the editor of the
   gazette but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article
   about them in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite
   ridicule it was a mistake of nahums to tell a stolid city man about
   the way the great overgrown mourningcloak butterflies behaved in
   connexion with these saxifrages

   april brought a kind of madness to the country folk and began that
   disuse of the road past nahums which led to its ultimate abandonment
   it was the vegetation all the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange
   colours and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage
   there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect
   with the proper flora of the region no sane wholesome colours were
   anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but
   everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased
   underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth
   the dutchmans breeches became a thing of sinister menace and the
   bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion ammi and the
   gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting
   familiarity and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule
   in the meteor nahum ploughed and sowed the tenacre pasture and the
   upland lot but did nothing with the land around the house he knew it
   would be of no use and hoped that the summers strange growths would
   draw all the poison from the soil he was prepared for almost anything
   now and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to
   be heard the shunning of his house by neighbors told on him of
   course; but it told on his wife more the boys were better off being
   at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the
   gossip thaddeus an especially sensitive youth suffered the most

   in may the insects came and nahums place became a nightmare of
   buzzing and crawling most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in
   their aspects and motions and their nocturnal habits contradicted all
   former experience the gardners took to watching at nightwatching in
   all directions at random for something    they could not tell what
   it was then that they all owned that thaddeus had been right about the
   trees mrs gardner was the next to see it from the window as she
   watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky the boughs
   surely moved and there was no wind it must be the sap strangeness
   had come into everything growing now yet it was none of nahums family
   at all who made the next discovery familiarity had dulled them and
   what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from
   bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends what
   he told in arkham was given a short paragraph in the gazette; and it
   was there that all the farmers nahum included saw it first the night
   had been dark and the buggylamps faint but around a farm in the
   valley which everyone knew from the account must be nahums the
   darkness had been less thick a dim though distinct luminosity seemed
   to inhere in all the vegetation grass leaves and blossoms alike
   while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to
   stir furtively in the yard near the barn

   the grass had so far seemed untouched and the cows were freely
   pastured in the lot near the house but toward the end of may the milk
   began to be bad then nahum had the cows driven to the uplands after
   which the trouble ceased not long after this the change in grass and
   leaves became apparent to the eye all the verdure was going grey and
   was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness ammi was now
   the only person who ever visited the place and his visits were
   becoming fewer and fewer when school closed the gardners were
   virtually cut off from the world and sometimes let ammi do their
   errands in town they were failing curiously both physically and
   mentally and no one was surprised when the news of mrs gardners
   madness stole around

   it happened in june about the anniversary of the meteors fall and
   the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not
   describe in her raving there was not a single specific noun but only
   verbs and pronouns things moved and changed and fluttered and ears
   tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds something was taken
   awayshe was being drained of somethingsomething was fastening
   itself on her that ought not to besomeone must make it keep
   offnothing was ever still in the nightthe walls and windows
   shifted nahum did not send her to the county asylum but let her
   wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and
   others even when her expression changed he did nothing but when the
   boys grew afraid of her and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she
   made faces at him he decided to keep her locked in the attic by july
   she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours and before that month
   was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the
   dark as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation

   it was a little before this that the horses had stampeded something
   had aroused them in the night and their neighing and kicking in their
   stalls had been terrible there seemed virtually nothing to do to calm
   them and when nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like
   frightened woodland deer it took a week to track all four and when
   found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable something
   had snapped in their brains and each one had to be shot for its own
   good nahum borrowed a horse from ammi for his haying but found it
   would not approach the barn it shied balked and whinnied and in the
   end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used
   their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for
   convenient pitching and all the while the vegetation was turning grey
   and brittle even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were
   greying now and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and
   tasteless the asters and goldenrod bloomed grey and distorted and
   the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such
   blasphemouslooking things that nahums oldest boy zenas cut them down
   the strangely puffed insects died about that time even the bees that
   had left their hives and taken to the woods

   by september all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder
   and nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of
   the soil his wife now had spells of terrific screaming and he and the
   boys were in a constant state of nervous tension they shunned people
   now and when school opened the boys did not go but it was ammi on
   one of his rare visits who first realised that the well water was no
   longer good it had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid nor
   exactly salty and ammi advised his friend to dig another well on
   higher ground to use till the soil was good again nahum however
   ignored the warning for he had by that time become calloused to
   strange and unpleasant things he and the boys continued to use the
   tainted supply drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate
   their meagre and illcooked meals and did their thankless and
   monotonous chores through the aimless days there was something of
   stolid resignation about them all as if they walked half in another
   world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom

   thaddeus went mad in september after a visit to the well he had gone
   with a pail and had come back emptyhanded shrieking and waving his
   arms and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about
   the moving colours down there two in one family was pretty bad but
   nahum was very brave about it he let the boy run about for a week
   until he began stumbling and hurting himself and then he shut him in
   an attic room across the hall from his mothers the way they screamed
   at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible
   especially to little merwin who fancied they talked in some terrible
   language that was not of earth merwin was getting frightfully
   imaginative and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of
   the brother who had been his greatest playmate

   almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced
   poultry turned greyish and died very quickly their meat being found
   dry and noisome upon cutting hogs grew inordinately fat then suddenly
   began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain their
   meat was of course useless and nahum was at his wits end no rural
   veterinary would approach his place and the city veterinary from
   arkham was openly baffled the swine began growing grey and brittle and
   falling to pieces before they died and their eyes and muzzles
   developed singular alterations it was very inexplicable for they had
   never been fed from the tainted vegetation then something struck the
   cows certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily
   shrivelled or compressed and atrocious collapses or disintegrations
   were common in the last stagesand death was always the resultthere
   would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs
   there could be no question of poison for all the cases occurred in a
   locked and undisturbed barn no bites of prowling things could have
   brought the virus for what live beast of earth can pass through solid
   obstacles? it must be only natural diseaseyet what disease could
   wreak such results was beyond any minds guessing when the harvest
   came there was not an animal surviving on the place for the stock and
   poultry were dead and the dogs had run away these dogs three in
   number had all vanished one night and were never heard of again the
   five cats had left some time before but their going was scarcely
   noticed since there now seemed to be no mice and only mrs gardner had
   made pets of the graceful felines

   on the nineteenth of october nahum staggered into ammis house with
   hideous news the death had come to poor thaddeus in his attic room
   and it had come in a way which could not be told nahum had dug a grave
   in the railed family plot behind the farm and had put therein what he
   found there could have been nothing from outside for the small barred
   window and locked door were intact; but it was much as it had been in
   the barn ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they
   could but shuddered as they did so stark terror seemed to cling round
   the gardners and all they touched and the very presence of one in the
   house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable ammi accompanied
   nahum home with the greatest reluctance and did what he might to calm
   the hysterical sobbing of little merwin zenas needed no calming he
   had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his
   father told him; and ammi thought that his fate was very merciful now
   and then merwins screams were answered faintly from the attic and in
   response to an inquiring look nahum said that his wife was getting very
   feeble when night approached ammi managed to get away; for not even
   friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the
   vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind
   it was really lucky for ammi that he was not more imaginative even as
   things were his mind was bent ever so slightly; but had he been able
   to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must
   inevitably have turned a total maniac in the twilight he hastened
   home the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing
   horribly in his ears

   three days later nahum lurched into ammis kitchen in the early
   morning and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale
   once more while mrs pierce listened in a clutching fright it was
   little merwin this time he was gone he had gone out late at night
   with a lantern and pail for water and had never come back hed been
   going to pieces for days and hardly knew what he was about screamed
   at everything there had been a frantic shriek from the yard then but
   before the father could get to the door the boy was gone there was no
   glow from the lantern he had taken and of the child himself no trace
   at the time nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when
   dawn came and the man had plodded back from his allnight search of
   the woods and fields he had found some very curious things near the
   well there was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron
   which had certainly been the lantern; while a bent bail and twisted
   iron hoops beside it both halffused seemed to hint at the remnants
   of the pail that was all nahum was past imagining mrs pierce was
   blank and ammi when he had reached home and heard the tale could
   give no guess merwin was gone and there would be no use in telling
   the people around who shunned all gardners now no use either in
   telling the city people at arkham who laughed at everything thad was
   gone and now merwin was gone something was creeping and creeping and
   waiting to be seen and felt and heard nahum would go soon and he
   wanted ammi to look after his wife and zenas if they survived him it
   must all be a judgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what
   for since he had always walked uprightly in the lords ways so far as
   he knew

   for over two weeks ammi saw nothing of nahum; and then worried about
   what might have happened he overcame his fears and paid the gardner
   place a visit there was no smoke from the great chimney and for a
   moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst the aspect of the
   whole farm was shockinggreyish withered grass and leaves on the
   ground vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and
   gables and great bare trees clawing up at the grey november sky with a
   studied malevolence which ammi could not but feel had come from some
   subtle change in the tilt of the branches but nahum was alive after
   all he was weak and lying on a couch in the lowceiled kitchen but
   perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to zenas the room
   was deadly cold; and as ammi visibly shivered the host shouted huskily
   to zenas for more wood wood indeed was sorely needed; since the
   cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty with a cloud of soot blowing
   about in the chill wind that came down the chimney presently nahum
   asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable and then
   ammi saw what had happened the stoutest cord had broken at last and
   the hapless farmers mind was proof against more sorrow

   questioning tactfully ammi could get no clear data at all about the
   missing zenas in the wellhe lives in the well was all that the
   clouded father would say then there flashed across the visitors mind
   a sudden thought of the mad wife and he changed his line of inquiry
   nabby? why here she is! was the surprised response of poor nahum
   and ammi soon saw that he must search for himself leaving the harmless
   babbler on the couch he took the keys from their nail beside the door
   and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic it was very close and
   noisome up there and no sound could be heard from any direction of
   the four doors in sight only one was locked and on this he tried
   various keys on the ring he had taken the third key proved the right
   one and after some fumbling ammi threw open the low white door

   it was quite dark inside for the window was small and halfobscured by
   the crude wooden bars; and ammi could see nothing at all on the
   wideplanked floor the stench was beyond enduring and before
   proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with
   his lungs filled with breathable air when he did enter he saw
   something dark in the corner and upon seeing it more clearly he
   screamed outright while he screamed he thought a momentary cloud
   eclipsed the window and a second later he felt himself brushed as if
   by some hateful current of vapour strange colours danced before his
   eyes; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of
   the globule in the meteor that the geologists hammer had shattered
   and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring as it was
   he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him
   and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young
   thaddeus and the livestock but the terrible thing about this horror
   was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to
   crumble

   ammi would give me no added particulars to this scene but the shape in
   the corner does not reappear in his tale as a moving object there are
   things which cannot be mentioned and what is done in common humanity
   is sometimes cruelly judged by the law i gathered that no moving thing
   was left in that attic room and that to leave anything capable of
   motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any
   accountable being to eternal torment anyone but a stolid farmer would
   have fainted or gone mad but ammi walked conscious through that low
   doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him there would be nahum
   to deal with now; he must be fed and tended and removed to some place
   where he could be cared for

   commencing his descent of the dark stairs ammi heard a thud below him
   he even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off and recalled
   nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful
   room above what presence had his cry and entry started up? halted by
   some vague fear he heard still further sounds below indubitably there
   was a sort of heavy dragging and a most detestably sticky noise as of
   some fiendish and unclean species of suction with an associative sense
   goaded to feverish heights he thought unaccountably of what he had
   seen upstairs good god! what eldritch dreamworld was this into which
   he had blundered? he dared move neither backward nor forward but stood
   there trembling at the black curve of the boxedin staircase every
   trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain the sounds the sense
   of dread expectancy the darkness the steepness of the narrow
   stepsand merciful heaven!the faint but unmistakable luminosity of
   all the woodwork in sight; steps sides exposed laths and beams
   alike!

   then there burst forth a frantic whinny from ammis horse outside
   followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway in
   another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot leaving the
   frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them but that
   was not all there had been another sound out there a sort of liquid
   splashwaterit must have been the well he had left hero untied near
   it and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a
   stone and still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably
   ancient woodwork god! how old the house was! most of it built before
   1670 and the gambrel roof not later than 1730

   a feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly and
   ammis grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic
   for some purpose slowly nerving himself he finished his descent and
   walked boldly toward the kitchen but he did not complete the walk
   because what he sought was no longer there it had come to meet him
   and it was still alive after a fashion whether it had crawled or
   whether it had been dragged by any external force ammi could not say;
   but the death had been at it everything had happened in the last
   halfhour but collapse greying and disintegration were already far
   advanced there was a horrible brittleness and dry fragments were
   scaling off ammi could not touch it but looked horrifiedly into the
   distorted parody that had been a face what was it nahumwhat was
   it? he whispered and the cleft bulging lips were just able to
   crackle out a final answer

   nothin    nothin    the colour    it burns    cold an
   wet but it burns    it lived in the well    i seen it    a
   kind of smoke    jest like the flowers last spring    the well
   shone at night    thad an mernie an zenas    everything
   alive    suckin the life out of everything    in that
   stone    it must a come in that stone pizened the whole place   
   dunt know what it wants    that round thing them men from the
   college dug outen the stone    they smashed it    it was that
   same colour    jest the same like the flowers an plants    must
   a ben more of em    seeds    seeds    they growed    i
   seen it the fust time this week    must a got strong on zenas   
   he was a big boy full o life    it beats down your mind an then
   gits ye    burns ye up    in the well water    you was right
   about that    evil water    zenas never come back from the
   well    cant git away    draws ye    ye know summats comin
   but taint no use    i seen it time an agin senct zenas was
   took    whars nabby ammi?    my heads no good    dunt know
   how long sence i fed her    itll git her ef we aint keerful   
   jest a colour    her face is gittin to hev that colour sometimes
   towards night    an it burns an sucks    it come from some
   place whar things aint as they is here    one o them professors
   said so    he was right    look out ammi itll do suthin
   more    sucks the life out   

   but that was all that which spoke could speak no more because it had
   completely caved in ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was
   left and reeled out the back door into the fields he climbed the slope
   to the tenacre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the
   woods he could not pass that well from which his horse had run away
   he had looked at it through the window and had seen that no stone was
   missing from the rim then the lurching buggy had not dislodged
   anything after allthe splash had been something elsesomething which
   went into the well after it had done with poor nahum

   when ammi reached his house the horse and buggy had arrived before him
   and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety reassuring her without
   explanations he set out at once for arkham and notified the
   authorities that the gardner family was no more he indulged in no
   details but merely told of the deaths of nahum and nabby that of
   thaddeus being already known and mentioned that the cause seemed to be
   the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock he also stated
   that merwin and zenas had disappeared there was considerable
   questioning at the police station and in the end ammi was compelled to
   take three officers to the gardner farm together with the coroner the
   medical examiner and the veterinary who had treated the diseased
   animals he went much against his will for the afternoon was advancing
   and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place but it was
   some comfort to have so many people with him

   the six men drove out in a democratwagon following ammis buggy and
   arrived at the pestridden farmhouse about four oclock used as the
   officers were to gruesome experiences not one remained unmoved at what
   was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the
   floor below the whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was
   terrible enough but those two crumbling objects were beyond all
   bounds no one could look long at them and even the medical examiner
   admitted that there was very little to examine specimens could be
   analysed of course so he busied himself in obtaining themand here
   it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college
   laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken under the
   spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum in which many
   of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange
   meteor had yielded in the previous year the property of emitting this
   spectrum vanished in a month the dust thereafter consisting mainly of
   alkaline phosphates and carbonates

   ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they
   meant to do anything then and there it was getting toward sunset and
   he was anxious to be away but he could not help glancing nervously at
   the stony curb by the great sweep and when a detective questioned him
   he admitted that nahum had feared something down thereso much so that
   he had never even thought of searching it for merwin or zenas after
   that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well
   immediately so ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of
   rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside
   the men sniffed in disgust at the fluid and toward the last held their
   noses against the foetor they were uncovering it was not so long a job
   as they had feared it would be since the water was phenomenally low
   there is no need to speak too exactly of what they found merwin and
   zenas were both there in part though the vestiges were mainly
   skeletal there were also a small deer and a large dog in about the
   same state and a number of bones of smaller animals the ooze and
   slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling and a man
   who descended on handholds with a long pole found that he could sink
   the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting
   any solid obstruction

   twilight had now fallen and lanterns were brought from the house
   then when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the
   well everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sittingroom
   while the intermittent light of a spectral halfmoon played wanly on
   the grey desolation outside the men were frankly nonplussed by the
   entire case and could find no convincing common element to link the
   strange vegetable conditions the unknown disease of livestock and
   humans and the unaccountable deaths of merwin and zenas in the tainted
   well they had heard the common country talk it is true; but could not
   believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred no doubt
   the meteor had poisoned the soil but the illness of persons and
   animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter
   was it the well water? very possibly it might be a good idea to
   analyze it but what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump
   into the well? their deeds were so similarand the fragments shewed
   that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death why was
   everything so grey and brittle?

   it was the coroner seated near a window overlooking the yard who
   first noticed the glow about the well night had fully set in and all
   the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful
   moonbeams; but this new glow was something definite and distinct and
   appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a
   searchlight giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where
   the water had been emptied it had a very queer colour and as all the
   men clustered round the window ammi gave a violent start for this
   strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue he had
   seen that colour before and feared to think what it might mean he had
   seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aërolite two summers ago
   had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime and had thought
   he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small
   barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had
   happened it had flashed there a second and a clammy and hateful
   current of vapour had brushed past himand then poor nahum had been
   taken by something of that colour he had said so at the lastsaid it
   was like the globule and the plants after that had come the runaway in
   the yard and the splash in the welland now that well was belching
   forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint

   it does credit to the alertness of ammis mind that he puzzled even at
   that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific he
   could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a
   vapour glimpsed in the daytime against a window opening on the morning
   sky and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist
   against the black and blasted landscape it wasnt rightit was
   against natureand he thought of those terrible last words of his
   stricken friend it come from some place whar things aint as they is
   here    one o them professors said so   

   all three horses outside tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the
   road were now neighing and pawing frantically the wagon driver
   started for the door to do something but ammi laid a shaky hand on his
   shoulder dunt go out thar he whispered theys more to this nor
   what we know nahum said somethin lived in the well that sucks your
   life out he said it must be someat growed from a round ball like one
   we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago june sucks an
   burns he said an is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar
   now that ye can hardly see an cant tell what it is nahum thought it
   feeds on everything livin an gits stronger all the time he said he
   seen it this last week it must be somethin from away off in the sky
   like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was the
   way its made an the way it works aint like no way o gods world
   its someat from beyond

   so the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger
   and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy it was
   truly an awful moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house
   itself four monstrous sets of fragmentstwo from the house and two
   from the wellin the woodshed behind and that shaft of unknown and
   unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front ammi had restrained
   the driver on impulse forgetting how uninjured he himself was after
   the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room but
   perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did no one will ever
   know what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond
   had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind there is no telling
   what it might not have done at that last moment and with its seemingly
   increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to
   display beneath the halfclouded moonlit sky

   all at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short sharp
   gasp the others looked at him and then quickly followed his own gaze
   upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly
   arrested there was no need for words what had been disputed in
   country gossip was disputable no longer and it is because of the thing
   which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on that the
   strange days are never talked about in arkham it is necessary to
   premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening one did
   arise not long afterward but there was absolutely none then even the
   dry tips of the lingering hedgemustard grey and blighted and the
   fringe on the roof of the standing democratwagon were unstirred and
   yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees
   in the yard were moving they were twitching morbidly and
   spasmodically clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the
   moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked
   by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors
   writhing and struggling below the black roots

   not a man breathed for several seconds then a cloud of darker depth
   passed over the moon and the silhouette of clutching branches faded
   out momentarily at this there was a general cry; muffled with awe but
   husky and almost identical from every throat for the terror had not
   faded with the silhouette and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness
   the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny
   points of faint and unhallowed radiance tipping each bough like the
   fire of st elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles heads at
   pentecost it was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light like a
   glutted swarm of corpsefed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an
   accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which
   ammi had come to recognize and dread all the while the shaft of
   phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter
   bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and
   abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could
   form it was no longer shining out it was pouring out; and as the
   shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow
   directly into the sky

   the veterinary shivered and walked to the front door to drop the heavy
   extra bar across it ammi shook no less and had to tug and point for
   lack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the
   growing luminosity of the trees the neighing and stamping of the
   horses had become utterly frightful but not a soul of that group in
   the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward with
   the moments the shining of the trees increased while their restless
   branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality the wood of
   the wellsweep was shining now and presently a policeman dumbly
   pointed to some wooden sheds and beehives near the stone wall on the
   west they were commencing to shine too though the tethered vehicles
   of the visitors seemed so far unaffected then there was a wild
   commotion and clopping in the road and as ammi quenched the lamp for
   better seeing they realized that the span of frantic greys had broke
   their sapling and run off with the democratwagon

   the shock served to loosen several tongues and embarrassed whispers
   were exchanged it spreads on everything organic thats been around
   here muttered the medical examiner no one replied but the man who
   had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred
   up something intangible it was awful he added there was no bottom
   at all just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking
   under there ammis horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the
   road outside and nearly drowned its owners faint quaver as he mumbled
   his formless reflections it come from that stone    it growed down
   thar    it got everything livin    it fed itself on em mind
   and body    thad an mernie zenas an nabby    nahum was the
   last    they all drunk the water    it got strong on em    it
   come from beyond whar things aint like they be here    now its
   goin home   

   at this point as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger
   and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which
   each spectator later described differently there came from poor
   tethered hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a
   horse every person in that lowpitched sitting room stopped his ears
   and ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea words could
   not convey itwhen ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled
   inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy
   that was the last of hero till they buried him next day but the
   present was no time to mourn for almost at this instant a detective
   silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with
   them in the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint
   phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment it glowed on
   the broadplanked floor and the fragment of rag carpet and shimmered
   over the sashes of the smallpaned windows it ran up and down the
   exposed cornerposts coruscated about the shelf and mantel and
   infected the very doors and furniture each minute saw it strengthen
   and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave
   that house

   ammi shewed them the back door and the path up through the fields to
   the tenacre pasture they walked and stumbled as in a dream and did
   not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground they
   were glad of the path for they could not have gone the front way by
   that well it was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds and
   those shining orchard trees with their gnarled fiendish contours; but
   thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up the moon
   went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge
   over chapmans brook and it was blind groping from there to the open
   meadows

   when they looked back toward the valley and the distant gardner place
   at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight all the farm was shining with
   the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees buildings and even such
   grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey
   brittleness the boughs were all straining skyward tipped with tongues
   of foul flame and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were
   creeping about the ridgepoles of the house barn and sheds it was a
   scene from a vision of fuseli and over all the rest reigned that riot
   of luminous amorphousness that alien and undimensioned rainbow of
   cryptic poison from the wellseething feeling lapping reaching
   scintillating straining and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and
   unrecognizable chromaticism

   then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the
   sky like a rocket or meteor leaving behind no trail and disappearing
   through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man
   could gasp or cry out no watcher can ever forget that sight and ammi
   stared blankly at the stars of cygnus deneb twinkling above the
   others where the unknown colour had melted into the milky way but his
   gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in
   the valley it was just that only a wooden ripping and crackling and
   not an explosion as so many others of the party vowed yet the outcome
   was the same for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up
   from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of
   unnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw
   it and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such
   coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown
   through quickly reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity
   that had vanished and in another second they had vanished too behind
   and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return and
   all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black
   frore gusts from interstellar space it shrieked and howled and lashed
   the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy till soon the
   trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to
   shew what was left down there at nahums

   too awed even to hint theories the seven shaking men trudged back
   toward arkham by the north road ammi was worse than his fellows and
   begged them to see him inside his own kitchen instead of keeping
   straight on to town he did not wish to cross the blighted
   windwhipped woods alone to his home on the main road for he had had
   an added shock that the others were spared and was crushed forever
   with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come
   as the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set
   their faces toward the road ammi had looked back an instant at the
   shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his illstarred
   friend and from that stricken faraway spot he had seen something
   feebly rise only to sink down again upon the place from which the
   great shapeless horror had shot into the sky it was just a colourbut
   not any colour of our earth or heavens and because ammi recognized
   that colour and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down
   there in the well he has never been quite right since

   ammi would never go near the place again it is fortyfour years now
   since the horror happened but he has never been there and will be
   glad when the new reservoir blots it out i shall be glad too for i
   do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of
   that abandoned well i passed i hope the water will always be very
   deepbut even so i shall never drink it i do not think i shall visit
   the arkham country hereafter three of the men who had been with ammi
   returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight but there were
   not any real ruins only the bricks of the chimney the stones of the
   cellar some mineral and metallic litter here and there and the rim of
   that nefandous well save for ammis dead horse which they towed away
   and buried and the buggy which they shortly returned to him
   everything that had ever been living had gone five eldritch acres of
   dusty grey desert remained nor has anything ever grown there since to
   this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in
   the woods and fields and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in
   spite of the rural tales have named it the blasted heath

   the rural tales are queer they might be even queerer if city men and
   college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from
   that disused well or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to
   disperse botanists too ought to study the stunted flora on the
   borders of that spot for they might shed light on the country notion
   that the blight is spreadinglittle by little perhaps an inch a year
   people say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in
   the spring and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter
   snow snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is
   elsewhere horsesthe few that are left in this motor agegrow
   skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs
   too near the splotch of greyish dust

   they say the mental influences are very bad too; numbers went queer in
   the years after nahums taking and always they lacked the power to get
   away then the strongerminded folk all left the region and only the
   foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads they could
   not stay though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours
   their wild weird stories of whispered magic have given them their
   dreams at night they protest are very horrible in that grotesque
   country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a
   morbid fancy no traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in
   those deep ravines and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose
   mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye i myself am curious
   about the sensation i derived from my one lone walk before ammi told me
   his tale when twilight came i had vaguely wished some clouds would
   gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept
   into my soul

   do not ask me for my opinion i do not knowthat is all there was no
   one but ammi to question; for arkham people will not talk about the
   strange days and all three professors who saw the aërolite and its
   coloured globule are dead there were other globulesdepend upon that
   one must have fed itself and escaped and probably there was another
   which was too late no doubt it is still down the welli know there
   was something wrong with the sunlight i saw above that miasmal brink
   the rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year so perhaps there is a
   kind of growth or nourishment even now but whatever demon hatchling is
   there it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly
   spread is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air?
   one of the current arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move
   as they ought not to do at night

   what it is only god knows in terms of matter i suppose the thing ammi
   described would be called a gas but this gas obeyed laws that are not
   of our cosmos this was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on
   the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories this was
   no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers
   measure or deem too vast to measure it was just a colour out of
   spacea frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond
   all nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the
   brain and numbs us with the black extracosmic gulfs it throws open
   before our frenzied eyes

   i doubt very much if ammi consciously lied to me and i do not think
   his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned
   something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor and
   something terriblethough i know not in what proportionstill
   remains i shall be glad to see the water come meanwhile i hope
   nothing will happen to ammi he saw so much of the thingand its
   influence was so insidious why has he never been able to move away?
   how clearly he recalled those dying words of nahumscant git
   away    draws ye    ye know summats comin but taint no
   use    ammi is such a good old manwhen the reservoir gang gets
   to work i must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him i
   would hate to think of him as the grey twisted brittle monstrosity
   which persists more and more in troubling my sleep

   of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written the
   ecstasies and horrors of de quincey and the paradis artificiels of
   baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them
   immortal and the world knows well the beauty the terror and the
   mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is
   transported but much as has been told no man has yet dared intimate
   the nature of the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind or hint at the
   direction of the unheardof roads along whose ornate and exotic course
   the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne de quincey was drawn
   back into asia that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous
   antiquity is so impressive that the vast age of the race and name
   overpowers the sense of youth in the individual but farther than that
   he dared not go those who have gone farther seldom returned and even
   when they have they have been either silent or quite mad i took opium
   but once  in the year of the plague when doctors sought to deaden
   the agonies they could not cure there was an overdose  my physician
   was worn out with horror and exertion  and i travelled very far
   indeed in the end i returned and lived but my nights are filled with
   strange memories nor have i ever permitted a doctor to give me opium
   again

   the pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the
   drug was administered of the future i had no heed; to escape whether
   by cure unconsciousness or death was all that concerned me i was
   partly delirious so that it is hard to place the exact moment of
   transition but i think the effect must have begun shortly before the
   pounding ceased to be painful as i have said there was an overdose;
   so my reactions were probably far from normal the sensation of
   falling curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction
   was paramount; though there was subsidiary impression of unseen throngs
   in incalculable profusion throngs of infinitely diverse nature but
   all more or less related to me sometimes it seemed less as though i
   were falling than as though the universe or the ages were falling past
   me suddenly my pain ceased and i began to associate the pounding with
   an external rather than internal force the falling had ceased also
   giving place to a sensation of uneasy temporary rest; and when i
   listened closely i fancied the pounding was that of the vast
   inscrutable sea as its sinister colossal breakers lacerated some
   desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude then i opened my
   eyes for a moment my surroundings seemed confused like a projected
   image hopelessly out of focus but gradually i realised my solitary
   presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows of
   the exact nature of the apartment i could form no idea for my thoughts
   were still far from settled but i noticed vancoloured rugs and
   draperies elaborately fashioned tables chairs ottomans and divans
   and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the
   exotic without being actually alien these things i noticed yet they
   were not long uppermost in my mind slowly but inexorably crawling upon
   my consciousness and rising above every other impression came a
   dizzying fear of the unknown; a fear all the greater because i could
   not analyse it and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menace;
   not death but some nameless unheardof thing inexpressibly more
   ghastly and abhorrent presently i realised that the direct symbol and
   excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant
   reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain it
   seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which i
   stood and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images
   i felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the silkhung
   walls and shrank from glancing through the arched latticed windows
   that opened so bewilderingly on every hand perceiving shutters
   attached to these windows i closed them all averting my eyes from the
   exterior as i did so then employing a flint and steel which i found
   on one of the small tables i lit the many candles reposing about the
   walls in arabesque sconces the added sense of security brought by
   closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree
   but i could not shut out the monotonous pounding now that i was
   calmer the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful and i felt a
   contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful
   shrinking opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the
   pounding i beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a
   carven door and large oriel window to this window i was irresistibly
   drawn though my illdefined apprehensions seemed almost equally bent
   on holding me back as i approached it i could see a chaotic whirl of
   waters in the distance then as i attained it and glanced out on all
   sides the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with
   full and devastating force

   i beheld such a sight as i had never beheld before and which no living
   person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of
   opium the building stood on a narrow point of land  or what was now
   a narrow point of land  fully three hundred feet above what must
   lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters on either side of the
   house there fell a newly washedout precipice of red earth whilst
   ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully eating
   away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation out a mile or
   more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in
   height and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque
   contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures the waves
   were dark and purplish almost black and clutched at the yielding red
   mud of the bank as if with uncouth greedy hands i could not but feel
   that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon
   all the solid ground perhaps abetted by the angry sky

   recovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural
   spectacle had thrown me i realized that my actual physical danger was
   acute even whilst i gazed the bank had lost many feet and it could
   not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit
   of lashing waves accordingly i hastened to the opposite side of the
   edifice and finding a door emerged at once locking it after me with
   a curious key which had hung inside i now beheld more of the strange
   region about me and marked a singular division which seemed to exist
   in the hostile ocean and firmament on each side of the jutting
   promontory different conditions held sway at my left as i faced inland
   was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in
   under a brightly shining sun something about that suns nature and
   position made me shudder but i could not then tell and cannot tell
   now what it was at my right also was the sea but it was blue calm
   and only gently undulating while the sky above it was darker and the
   washedout bank more nearly white than reddish i now turned my
   attention to the land and found occasion for fresh surprise; for the
   vegetation resembled nothing i had ever seen or read about it was
   apparently tropical or at least subtropical  a conclusion borne out
   by the intense heat of the air sometimes i thought i could trace
   strange analogies with the flora of my native land fancying that the
   wellknown plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical
   change of climate; but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were
   plainly foreign the house i had just left was very small  hardly
   more than a cottage  but its material was evidently marble and its
   architecture was weird and composite involving a quaint fusion of
   western and eastern forms at the corners were corinthian columns but
   the red tile roof was like that of a chinese pagoda from the door
   inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand about four feet
   wide and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable
   flowering shrubs and plants it lay toward the side of the promontory
   where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish down this path i
   felt impelled to flee as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the
   pounding ocean at first it was slightly uphill then i reached a
   gentle crest behind me i saw the scene i had left; the entire point
   with the cottage and the black water with the green sea on one side
   and the blue sea on the other and a curse unnamed and unnamable
   lowering over all i never saw it again and often wonder after
   this last look i strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before
   me

   the path as i have intimated ran along the righthand shore as one
   went inland ahead and to the left i now viewed a magnificent valley
   comprising thousands of acres and covered with a swaying growth of
   tropical grass higher than my head almost at the limit of vision was a
   colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me by this
   time wonder and escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely
   dissipated my fear but as i paused and sank fatigued to the path idly
   digging with my hands into the warm whitishgolden sand a new and
   acute sense of danger seized me some terror in the swishing tall grass
   seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea and i started up
   crying aloud and disjointedly tiger? tiger? is it tiger? beast?
   beast? is it a beast that i am afraid of? my mind wandered back to an
   ancient and classical story of tigers which i had read; i strove to
   recall the author but had difficulty then in the midst of my fear i
   remembered that the tale was by rudyard kipling; nor did the
   grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me; i wished
   for the volume containing this story and had almost started back
   toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the
   lure of the palm prevented me

   whether or not i could have resisted the backward beckoning without the
   counterfascination of the vast palm tree i do not know this
   attraction was now dominant and i left the path and crawled on hands
   and knees down the valleys slope despite my fear of the grass and of
   the serpents it might contain i resolved to fight for life and reason
   as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land though i
   sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses
   joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant
   breakers i would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for
   relief but could never quite shut out the detestable sound it was as
   it seemed to me only after ages that i finally dragged myself to the
   beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shade

   there now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the
   opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror; incidents which i tremble to
   recall and dare not seek to interpret no sooner had i crawled beneath
   the overhanging foliage of the palm than there dropped from its
   branches a young child of such beauty as i never beheld before though
   ragged and dusty this being bore the features of a faun or demigod
   and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the
   tree it smiled and extended its hand but before i could arise and
   speak i heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing; notes
   high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness the sun
   had by this time sunk below the horizon and in the twilight i saw an
   aureole of lambent light encircled the childs head then in a tone of
   silver it addressed me: it is the end they have come down through the
   gloaming from the stars now all is over and beyond the arinurian
   streams we shall dwell blissfully in teloe  as the child spoke i
   beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree and rising
   greeted a pair whom i knew to be the chief singers among those i had
   heard a god and goddess they must have been for such beauty is not
   mortal; and they took my hands saying come child you have heard
   the voices and all is well in teloe beyond the milky way and the
   arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony and upon
   their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful
   stars under the ivory bridges of teloe flow rivers of liquid gold
   bearing pleasurebarges bound for blossomy cytharion of the seven suns
   and in teloe and cytharion abide only youth beauty and pleasure nor
   are any sounds heard save of laughter song and the lute only the
   gods dwell in teloe of the golden rivers but among them shalt thou
   dwell

   as i listened enchanted i suddenly became aware of a change in my
   surroundings the palm tree so lately overshadowing my exhausted form
   was now some distance to my left and considerably below me i was
   obviously floating in the atmosphere; companioned not only by the
   strange child and the radiant pair but by a constantly increasing
   throng of halfluminous vinecrowned youths and maidens with
   windblown hair and joyful countenance we slowly ascended together as
   if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from
   the golden nebulae and the child whispered in my ear that i must look
   always upward to the pathways of light and never backward to the
   sphere i had just left the youths and maidens now chanted mellifluous
   choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes and i felt enveloped in a
   peace and happiness more profound than any i had in life imagined when
   the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my
   soul through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists
   as if in mocking daemoniac concord throbbed from gulfs below the
   damnable the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean as those black
   breakers beat their message into my ears i forgot the words of the
   child and looked back down upon the doomed scene from which i thought
   i had escaped

   down through the aether i saw the accursed earth slowly turning ever
   turning with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate
   shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted
   cities and under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights i can never
   describe sights i can never forget; deserts of corpselike clay and
   jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains
   and villages of my native land and maelstroms of frothing ocean where
   once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers round the northern pole
   steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours hissing before
   the onslaught of the evermounting waves that curled and fretted from
   the shuddering deep then a rending report clave the night and athwart
   the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift still the black ocean
   foamed and gnawed eating away the desert on either side as the rift in
   the center widened and widened there was now no land left but the
   desert and still the fuming ocean ate and ate all at once i thought
   even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something afraid of dark gods
   of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters but
   even if it was it could not turn back; and the desert had suffered too
   much from those nightmare waves to help them now so the ocean ate the
   last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf thereby giving up
   all it had ever conquered from the newflooded lands it flowed again
   uncovering death and decay; and from its ancient and immemorial bed it
   trickled loathsomely uncovering nighted secrets of the years when time
   was young and the gods unborn above the waves rose weedy remembered
   spires the moon laid pale lilies of light on dead london and paris
   stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with stardust then rose
   spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered; terrible
   spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were lands there was
   not any pounding now but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of
   waters tumbling into the rift the smoke of that rift had changed to
   steam and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser it seared
   my face and hands and when i looked to see how it affected my
   companions i found they had all disappeared then very suddenly it
   ended and i knew no more till i awaked upon a bed of convalescence as
   the cloud of steam from the plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire
   surface from my sight all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of
   mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether in one delirious
   flash and burst it happened; one blinding deafening holocaust of fire
   smoke and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to
   the void

   and when the smoke cleared away and i sought to look upon the earth i
   beheld against the background of cold humorous stars only the dying
   sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister

   in 1925 i went into oklahoma looking for snake lore and i came out
   with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life i admit it
   is foolish since there are natural explanations for everything i saw
   and heard but it masters me none the less if the old story had been
   all there was to it i would not have been so badly shaken my work as
   an american indian ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of
   extravagant legendry and i know that simple white people can beat the
   redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions but i
   cant forget what i saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in
   guthrie

   i called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me i
   would find something important there neither indians nor white men
   would discuss the snakegod legends i had come to trace the oilboom
   newcomers of course knew nothing of such matters and the red men and
   old pioneers were plainly frightened when i spoke of them not more
   than six or seven people mentioned the asylum and those who did were
   careful to talk in whispers but the whisperers said that dr mcneill
   could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all i wanted to know
   he could explain why yig the halfhuman father of serpents is a
   shunned and feared object in central oklahoma and why old settlers
   shiver at the secret indian orgies which make the autumn days and
   nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tomtoms in lonely places

   it was with the scent of a hound on the trail that i went to guthrie
   for i had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of
   serpentworship among the indians i had always felt from welldefined
   undertones of legend and archaeology that great quetzalcoatlbenign
   snakegod of the mexicanshad had an older and darker prototype; and
   during recent months i had wellnigh proved it in a series of
   researches stretching from guatemala to the oklahoma plains but
   everything was tantalising and incomplete for above the border the
   cult of the snake was hedged about by fear and furtiveness

   now it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to
   dawn and i sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness i did not
   try to cloak dr mcneill was a small cleanshaven man of somewhat
   advanced years and i saw at once from his speech and manner that he
   was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his
   profession grave and doubtful when i first made known my errand his
   face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the
   letter of introduction which a kindly old exindian agent had given me

   so youve been studying the yig legend eh? he reflected
   sententiously i know that many of our oklahoma ethnologists have
   tried to connect it with quetzalcoatl but i dont think any of them
   have traced the intermediate steps so well youve done remarkable work
   for a man as young as you seem to be and you certainly deserve all the
   data we can give

   i dont suppose old major moore or any of the others told you what it
   is i have here they dont like to talk about it and neither do i it
   is very tragic and very horrible but that is all i refuse to consider
   it anything supernatural theres a story about it that ill tell you
   after you see ita devilish sad story but one that i wont call
   magic it merely shews the potency that belief has over some people
   ill admit there are times when i feel a shiver thats more than
   physical but in daylight i set all that down to nerves im not a
   young fellow any more alas!

   to come to the point the thing i have is what you might call a victim
   of yigs cursea physically living victim we dont let the bulk of
   the nurses see it although most of them know its here there are just
   two steady old chaps whom i let feed it and clean out its
   quartersused to be three but good old stevens passed on a few years
   ago i suppose ill have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the
   thing doesnt seem to age or change much and we old boys cant last
   forever maybe the ethics of the near future will let us give it a
   merciful release but its hard to tell

   did you see that single groundglass basement window over in the east
   wing when you came up the drive? thats where it is ill take you
   there myself now you neednt make any comment just look through the
   moveable panel in the door and thank god the light isnt any stronger
   then ill tell you the storyor as much as ive been able to piece
   together

   we walked downstairs very quietly and did not talk as we threaded the
   corridors of the seemingly deserted basement dr mcneill unlocked a
   greypainted steel door but it was only a bulkhead leading to a
   further stretch of hallway at length he paused before a door marked b
   116 opened a small observation panel which he could use only by
   standing on tiptoe and pounded several times upon the painted metal
   as if to arouse the occupant whatever it might be

   a faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it and i
   fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low hissing response finally
   he motioned me to replace him at the peephole and i did so with a
   causeless and increasing tremor the barred groundglass window close
   to the earth outside admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor; and
   i had to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before i
   could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the strawcovered
   floor emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss then the
   shadowed outlines began to take shape and i perceived that the
   squirming entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat
   on its belly i clutched at the doorhandle for support as i tried to
   keep from fainting

   the moving object was almost of human size and entirely devoid of
   clothing it was absolutely hairless and its tawnylooking back seemed
   subtly squamous in the dim ghoulish light around the shoulders it was
   rather speckled and brownish and the head was very curiously flat as
   it looked up to hiss at me i saw that the beady little black eyes were
   damnably anthropoid but i could not bear to study them long they
   fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence so that i closed
   the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in
   its matted straw and spectral twilight i must have reeled a bit for i
   saw that the doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away i
   was stuttering over and over again: bbut for gods sake what is it?

   dr mcneill told me the story in his private office as i sprawled
   opposite him in an easychair the gold and crimson of late afternoon
   changed to the violet of early dusk but still i sat awed and
   motionless i resented every ring of the telephone and every whir of
   the buzzer and i could have cursed the nurses and internes whose
   knocks now and then summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office
   night came and i was glad my host switched on all the lights
   scientist though i was my zeal for research was half forgotten amidst
   such breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when
   whispered witchtales go the rounds of the chimneycorner

   it seems that yig the snakegod of the central plains
   tribespresumably the primal source of the more southerly quetzalcoatl
   or kukulcanwas an odd halfanthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary
   and capricious nature he was not wholly evil and was usually quite
   welldisposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his
   children the serpents; but in the autumn he became abnormally
   ravenous and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites that
   was why the tomtoms in the pawnee wichita and caddo country pounded
   ceaselessly week in and week out in august september and october; and
   why the medicinemen made strange noises with rattles and whistles
   curiously like those of the aztecs and mayas

   yigs chief trait was a relentless devotion to his childrena devotion
   so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the
   venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region frightful clandestine
   tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked
   harm upon his wriggling progeny; his chosen method being to turn his
   victim after suitable tortures to a spotted snake

   in the old days of the indian territory the doctor went on there was
   not quite so much secrecy about yig the plains tribes less cautious
   than the desert nomads and pueblos talked quite freely of their
   legends and autumn ceremonies with the first indian agents and let
   considerable of the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of
   white settlement the great fear came in the landrush days of 89
   when some extraordinary incidents had been rumoured and the rumours
   sustained by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs indians said
   that the new white men did not know how to get on with yig and
   afterward the settlers came to take that theory at face value now no
   oldtimer in middle oklahoma white or red could be induced to breathe
   a word about the snakegod except in vague hints yet after all the
   doctor added with almost needless emphasis the only truly
   authenticated horror had been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of
   bewitchment it was all very material and crueleven that last phase
   which had caused so much dispute

   dr mcneill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his
   special story and i felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre
   curtain rises the thing had begun when walker davis and his wife
   audrey left arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the
   spring of 1889 and the end had come in the country of the
   wichitasnorth of the wichita river in what is at present caddo
   county there is a small village called binger there now and the
   railway goes through; but otherwise the place is less changed than
   other parts of oklahoma it is still a section of farms and
   ranchesquite productive in these dayssince the great oilfields do
   not come very close

   walker and audrey had come from franklin county in the ozarks with a
   canvastopped wagon two mules an ancient and useless dog called
   wolf and all their household goods they were typical hillfolk
   youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most and looked
   forward to a life of better returns for their a hard work than they had
   had in arkansas both were lean rawboned specimens; the man tall
   sandy and greyeyed and the woman short and rather dark with a black
   straightness of hair suggesting a slight indian admixture

   in general there was very little of distinction about them and but
   for one thing their annals might not have differed from those of
   thousands of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that
   time that thing was walkers almost epileptic fear of snakes which
   some laid to prenatal causes and some said came from a dark prophecy
   about his end with which an old indian squaw had tried to scare him
   when he was small whatever the cause the effect was marked indeed;
   for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake
   would cause him to grow faint and pale while the sight of even a tiny
   specimen would produce a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion
   seizure

   the davises started out early in the year in the hope of being on
   their new land for the spring ploughing travel was slow; for the roads
   were bad in arkansas while in the territory there were great stretches
   of rolling hills and red sandy barrens without any roads whatever as
   the terrain grew flatter the change from their native mountains
   depressed them more perhaps than they realised; but they found the
   people at the indian agencies very affable while most of the settled
   indians seemed friendly and civil now and then they encountered a
   fellowpioneer with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable
   rivalry were generally exchanged

   owing to the season there were not many snakes in evidence so walker
   did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness in the earlier
   stages of the journey too there were no indian snakelegends to
   trouble him; for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not
   share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours as fate would
   have it it was a white man at okmulgee in the creek country who gave
   the davises the first hint of yig beliefs; a hint which had a curiously
   fascinating effect on walker and caused him to ask questions very
   freely after that

   before long walkers fascination had developed into a bad case of
   fright he took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the
   nightly camps always clearing away whatever vegetation he found and
   avoiding stony places whenever he could every clump of stunted bushes
   and every cleft in the great slablike rocks seemed to him now to hide
   malevolent serpents while every human figure not obviously part of a
   settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snakegod till
   nearness had proved the contrary fortunately no troublesome encounters
   came at this stage to shake his nerves still further

   as they approached the kickapoo country they found it harder and harder
   to avoid camping near rocks finally it was no longer possible and
   poor walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some of the
   rustic antisnake charms he had learned in his boyhood two or three
   times a snake was really glimpsed and these sights did not help the
   sufferer in his efforts to preserve composure

   on the twentysecond evening of the journey a savage wind made it
   imperative for the sake of the mules to camp in as sheltered a spot
   as possible; and audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a
   cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former
   tributary of the canadian river he did not like the rocky cast of the
   place but allowed himself to be overruled this once; leading the
   animals sullenly toward the protecting slope which the nature of the
   ground would not allow the wagon to approach

   audrey examining the rocks near the wagon meanwhile noticed a
   singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog seizing a rifle
   she followed his lead and presently thanked her stars that she had
   forestalled walker in her discovery for there snugly nested in the
   gap between two boulders was a sight it would have done him no good to
   see visible only as one convoluted expanse but perhaps comprising as
   many as three or four separate units was a mass of lazy wriggling
   which could not be other than a brood of newborn rattlesnakes

   anxious to save walker from a trying shock audrey did not hesitate to
   act but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down
   again and again upon the writhing objects her own sense of loathing
   was great but it did not amount to a real fear finally she saw that
   her task was done and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the
   red sand and dry dead grass near by she must she reflected cover
   the nest up before walker got back from tethering the mules old wolf
   tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was had
   vanished and she feared he had gone to fetch his master

   footsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded a second more
   and walker had seen everything audrey made a move to catch him if he
   should faint but he did no more than sway then the look of pure
   fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled
   awe and anger and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tones

   gawds sake aud but whyd ye go for to do that? haint ye heerd all
   the things theyve been tellin about this snakedevil yig? yed ought
   to a told me and wed a moved on dont ye know theys a devilgod
   what gets even if ye hurts his children? what for dye think the injuns
   all dances and beats their drums in the fall about? this lands under a
   curse i tell yenigh every soul weve atalked to sence we come ins
   said the same yig rules here an he comes out every fall for to git
   his victims and turn em into snakes why aud they wont none of them
   injuns acrost the canayjin kill a snake for love nor money!

   gawd knows what ye done to yourself gal astompin out a hull brood
   o yigs chillen hell git ye sure sooner or later unlessen i kin
   buy a charm offen some o the injun medicinemen hell git ye aud as
   sures theys a gawd in heavenhell come outa the night and turn ye
   into a crawlin spotted snake!

   all the rest of the journey walker kept up the frightened reproofs and
   prophecies they crossed the canadian near newcastle and soon
   afterward met with the first of the real plains indians they had
   seena party of blanketed wichitas whose leader talked freely under
   the spell of the whiskey offered him and taught poor walker a
   longwinded protective charm against yig in exchange for a quart bottle
   of the same inspiring fluid by the end of the week the chosen site in
   the wichita country was reached and the davises made haste to trace
   their boundaries and perform the spring ploughing before even beginning
   the construction of a cabin

   the region was flat drearily windy and sparse of natural vegetation
   but promised great fertility under cultivation occasional outcroppings
   of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone and here and
   there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground
   like a manmade floor there seemed to be a very few snakes or
   possible dens for them; so audrey at last persuaded walker to build the
   oneroom cabin over a vast smooth slab of exposed stone with such a
   flooring and with a goodsized fireplace the wettest weather might be
   defiedthough it soon became evident that dampness was no salient
   quality of the district logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest
   belt of woods many miles toward the wichita mountains

   walker built his widechimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of
   some of the other settlers though the nearest one was over a mile
   away in turn he helped his helpers at similar houseraisings so that
   many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours there was
   no town worthy the name nearer than el reno on the railway thirty
   miles or more to the northeast; and before many weeks had passed the
   people of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of
   their scattering the indians a few of whom had begun to settle down
   on ranches were for the most part harmless though somewhat
   quarrelsome when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to
   them despite all government bans

   of all the neighbours the davises found joe and sally compton who
   likewise hailed from arkansas the most helpful and congenial sally is
   still alive known now as grandma compton; and her son clyde then an
   infant in arms has become one of the leading men of the state sally
   and audrey used to visit each other often for their cabins were only
   two miles apart; and in the long spring and summer afternoons they
   exchanged many a tale of old arkansas and many a rumour about the new
   country

   sally was very sympathetic about walkers weakness regarding snakes
   but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness
   which audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying and
   prophesying about the curse of yig she was uncommonly full of gruesome
   snake stories and produced a direfully strong impression with her
   acknowledged masterpiecethe tale of a man in scott county who had
   been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once and had swelled so
   monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop
   needless to say audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband
   and she implored the comptons to beware of starting it on the rounds of
   the countryside it is to joes and sallys credit that they heeded
   this plea with the utmost fidelity

   walker did his cornplanting early and in midsummer improved his time
   by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region with the
   help of joe compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of very
   good water though he planned to sink an artesian later on he did not
   run into many serious snake scares and made his land as inhospitable
   as possible for wriggling visitors every now and then he rode over to
   the cluster of thatched conical huts which formed the main village of
   the wichitas and talked long with the old men and shamans about the
   snakegod and how to nullify his wrath charms were always ready in
   exchange for whiskey but much of the information he got was far from
   reassuring

   yig was a great god he was bad medicine he did not forget things in
   the autumn his children were hungry and wild and yig was hungry and
   wild too all the tribes made medicine against yig when the corn
   harvest came they gave him some corn and danced in proper regalia to
   the sound of whistle rattle and drum they kept the drums pounding to
   drive yig away and called down the aid of tir¡ whose children men
   are even as the snakes are yigs children it was bad that the squaw
   of davis killed the children of yig let davis say the charms many
   times when the corn harvest comes yig is yig yig is a great god

   by the time the corn harvest did come walker had succeeded in getting
   his wife into a deplorably jumpy state his prayers and borrowed
   incantations came to be a nuisance; and when the autumn rites of the
   indians began there was always a distant windborne pounding of
   tomtoms to lend an added background of the sinister it was maddening
   to have the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains
   why would it never stop? day and night week on week it was always
   going in exhaustless relays as persistently as the red dusty winds
   that carried it audrey loathed it more than her husband did for he
   saw in it a compensating element of protection it was with this sense
   of a mighty intangible bulwark against evil that he got in his corn
   crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winter

   the autumn was abnormally warm and except for their primitive cookery
   the davises found scant use for the stone fireplace walker had built
   with such care something in the unnaturalness of the hot dustclouds
   preyed on the nerves of all the settlers but most of all on audreys
   and walkers the notions of a hovering snakecurse and the weird
   endless rhythm of the distant indian drums formed a bad combination
   which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly
   unendurable

   notwithstanding this strain several festive gatherings were held at
   one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped; keeping
   naively alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvesthome
   which are as old as human agriculture itself lafayette smith who came
   from southern missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of
   walkers was a very passable fiddler; and his tunes did much to make
   the celebrants forget the monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms
   then halloween drew near and the settlers planned another
   frolicthis time had they but known it of a lineage older than even
   agriculture; the dread witchsabbath of the primal prearyans kept
   alive through ages in the midnight blackness of secret woods and still
   hinting at vague terrors under its latterday mask of comedy and
   lightness halloween was to fall on a thursday and the neighbours
   agreed to gather for their first revel at the davis cabin

   it was on that thirtyfirst of october that the warm spell broke the
   morning was grey and leaden and by noon the incessant winds had
   changed from searingness to rawness people shivered all the more
   because they were not prepared for the chill and walker davis old dog
   wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth but
   the distant drums still thumped on nor were the white citizenry less
   inclined to pursue their chosen rites as early as four in the
   afternoon the wagons began to arrive at walkers cabin; and in the
   evening after a memorable barbecue lafayette smiths fiddle inspired
   a very fairsized company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in
   the one goodsized but crowded room the younger folk indulged in the
   amiable inanities proper to the season and now and then old wolf would
   howl with doleful and spinetickling ominousness at some especially
   spectral strain from lafayettes squeaky violina device he had never
   heard before mostly though this battered veteran slept through the
   merriment; for he was past the age of active interests and lived
   largely in his dreams tom and jennie rigby had brought their collie
   zeke along but the canines did not fraternise zeke seemed strangely
   uneasy over something and nosed around curiously all the evening

   audrey and walker made a fine couple on the floor and grandma compton
   still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night their
   worries seemed forgotten for the nonce and walker was shaved and
   trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness by ten oclock all
   hands were healthily tired and the guests began to depart family by
   family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time
   everybody had had tom and jennie thought zekes eerie howls as he
   followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go home;
   though audrey said it must be the faraway tomtoms which annoyed him
   for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment
   within

   the night was bitterly cold and for the first time walker put a great
   log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering
   till morning old wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed
   into his customary coma audrey and walker too tired to think of
   charms or curses tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep
   before the cheap alarmclock on the mantel had ticked out three
   minutes and from far away the rhythmic pounding of those hellish
   tomtoms still pulsed on the chill nightwind

   dr mcneill paused here and removed his glasses as if a blurring of
   the objective world might make the reminiscent vision clearer

   youll soon appreciate he said that i had a great deal of
   difficulty in piecing out all that happened after the guests left
   there were times thoughat firstwhen i was able to make a try at
   it after a moment of silence he went on with the tale

   audrey had terrible dreams of yig who appeared to her in the guise of
   satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen it was indeed
   from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake
   to find walker already conscious and sitting up in bed he seemed to be
   listening intently to something and silenced her with a whisper when
   she began to ask what had roused him

   hark aud! he breathed dont ye hear somethin asingin and
   buzzin and rustlin? dye reckon its the fall crickets?

   certainly there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound
   as he had described audrey tried to analyse it and was impressed with
   some element at once horrible and familiar which hovered just outside
   the rim of her memory and beyond it all waking a hideous thought the
   monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms came incessantly across the
   black plains on which a cloudy halfmoon had set

   walkerspose itsthethecurse o yig?

   she could feel him tremble

   no gal i dont reckon he comes that away hes shapen like a man
   except ye look at him clost thats what chief grey eagle says this
   heres some varmints come in outen the coldnot crickets i calclate
   but summat like em id orter git up and stomp em out afore they make
   much headway or git at the cupboard

   he rose felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach and rattled
   the tin matchbox nailed to the wall beside it audrey sat up in bed
   and watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the
   lantern then as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room
   the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek
   for the flat rocky floor revealed in the newborn illumination was
   one seething brownspeckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes slithering
   toward the fire and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace
   the frightblasted lanternbearer

   it was only for an instant that audrey saw the things the reptiles
   were of every size of uncountable numbers and apparently of several
   varieties; and even as she looked two or three of them reared their
   heads as if to strike at walker she did not faintit was walkers
   crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into
   blackness he had not screamed a second timefright had paralysed him
   and he fell as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortals bow to
   audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically mingling
   with the nightmare from which she had started

   voluntary motion of any sort was impossible for will and the sense of
   reality had left her she fell back inertly on her pillow hoping that
   she would wake soon no actual sense of what had happened penetrated
   her mind for some time then little by little the suspicion that she
   was really awake began to dawn on her; and she was convulsed with a
   mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out
   despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mute

   walker was gone and she had not been able to help him he had died of
   snakes just as the old witchwoman had predicted when he was a little
   boy poor wolf had not been able to help eitherprobably he had not
   even awaked from his senile stupor and now the crawling things must be
   coming for her writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark
   perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing up
   over the coarse woollen blankets unconsciously she crept under the
   clothes and trembled

   it must be the curse of yig he had sent his monstrous children on
   allhallows night and they had taken walker first why was
   thatwasnt he innocent enough? why not come straight for herhadnt
   she killed those little rattlers alone? then she thought of the curses
   form as told by the indians she wouldnt be killedjust turned to a
   spotted snake ugh! so she would be like those things she had glimpsed
   on the floorthose things which yig had sent to get her and enroll her
   among their number! she tried to mumble a charm that walker had taught
   her but found she could not utter a single sound

   the noisy ticking of the alarmclock sounded above the maddening beat
   of the distant tomtoms the snakes were taking a long timedid they
   mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves? every now and then she
   thought she felt a steady insidious pressure on the bedclothes but
   each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her
   overwrought nerves the clock ticked on in the dark and a change came
   slowly over her thoughts

   those snakes couldnt have taken so long! they couldnt be yigs
   messengers after all but just natural rattlers that were nested below
   the rock and had been drawn there by the fire they werent coming for
   her perhapsperhaps they had sated themselves on poor walker where
   were they now? gone? coiled by the fire? still crawling over the prone
   corpse of their victim? the clock ticked and the distant drums
   throbbed on

   at the thought of her husbands body lying there in the pitch blackness
   a thrill of purely physical horror passed over audrey that story of
   sally comptons about the man back in scott county! he too had been
   bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes and what had happened to him?
   the poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse and in
   the end the bloated thing had burst horriblyburst horribly with a
   detestable popping noise was that what was happening to walker down
   there on the rock floor? instinctively she felt she had begun to listen
   for something too terrible even to name to herself

   the clock ticked on keeping a kind of mocking sardonic time with the
   faroff drumming that the nightwind brought she wished it were a
   striking clock so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil
   must last she cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her from
   fainting and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring after
   all probably neighbours would passno doubt somebody would
   callwould they find her still sane? was she still sane now?

   morbidly listening audrey all at once became aware of something which
   she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could
   believe it; and which once verified she did not know whether to
   welcome or dread the distant beating of the indian tomtoms had
   ceased they had always maddened herbut had not walker regarded them
   as a bulwark against nameless evil from outside the universe? what were
   some of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking
   with grey eagle and the wichita medicinemen?

   she did not relish this new and sudden silence after all! there was
   something sinister about it the loudticking clock seemed abnormal in
   its new loneliness capable at last of conscious motion she shook the
   covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window it
   must have cleared after the moon set for she saw the square aperture
   distinctly against the background of stars

   then without warning came that shocking unutterable soundugh!that
   dull putrid pop of cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark
   god!sallys storythat obscene stench and this gnawing clawing
   silence! it was too much the bonds of muteness snapped and the black
   night waxed reverberant with audreys screams of stark unbridled
   frenzy

   consciousness did not pass away with the shock how merciful if only it
   had! amidst the echoes of her shrieking audrey still saw the
   starsprinkled square of window ahead and heard the doomboding
   ticking of that frightful clock did she hear another sound? was that
   square window still a perfect square? she was in no condition to weigh
   the evidence of her senses or distinguish between fact and
   hallucination

   nothat window was not a perfect square something had encroached on
   the lower edge nor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the
   room there was beyond dispute a heavy breathing neither her own nor
   poor wolfs wolf slept very silently and his wakeful wheezing was
   unmistakable then audrey saw against the stars the black daemoniac
   silhouette of something anthropoidthe undulant bulk of a gigantic
   head and shoulders fumbling slowly toward her

   yaaaah! yaaaah! go away! go away! go away snakedevil! go way
   yig! i didnt mean to kill emi was feared hed be scairt of em
   dont yig dont! i didnt go for to hurt yore chillendont come
   nigh medont change me into no spotted snake!

   but the halfformless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the
   bed very silently

   everything snapped at once inside audreys head and in a second she
   had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman she knew where
   the axe washung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern it
   was within easy reach and she could find it in the dark before she
   was conscious of anything further it was in her hands and she was
   creeping toward the foot of the bedtoward the monstrous head and
   shoulders that every moment groped their way nearer had there been any
   light the look on her face would not have been pleasant to see

   take that you! and that and that and that!

   she was laughing shrilly now and her cackles mounted higher as she saw
   that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic
   pallor of coming dawn

   dr mcneill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his
   glasses again i waited for him to resume and as he kept silent i
   spoke softly

   she lived? she was found? was it ever explained?

   the doctor cleared his throat

   yesshe lived in a way and it was explained i told you there was
   no bewitchmentonly cruel pitiful material horror

   it was sally compton who had made the discovery she had ridden over to
   the davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with audrey
   and had seen no smoke from the chimney that was queer it had turned
   very warm again yet audrey was usually cooking something at that hour
   the mules were making hungrysounding noises in the barn and there was
   no sign of old wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the door

   altogether sally did not like the look of the place so was very timid
   and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked she got no answer but
   waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs the lock
   it appeared was unfastened; and she slowly pushed her way in then
   perceiving what was there she reeled back gasped and clung to the
   jamb to preserve her balance

   a terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door but that was
   not what had stunned her it was what she had seen for within that
   shadowy cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects
   remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholder

   near the burnedout fireplace was the great dogpurple decay on the
   skin left bare by mange and old age and the whole carcass burst by the
   puffing effect of rattlesnake poison it must have been bitten by a
   veritable legion of the reptiles

   to the right of the door was the axehacked remnant of what had been a
   manclad in a nightshirt and with the shattered bulk of a lantern
   clenched in one hand he was totally free from any sign of snakebite
   near him lay the ensanguined axe carelessly discarded

   and wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome vacanteyed thing that
   had been a woman but was now only a mute mad caricature all that this
   thing could do was to hiss and hiss and hiss

   both the doctor and i were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by
   this time he poured something from a flask on his desk took a nip
   and handed another glass to me i could only suggest tremulously and
   stupidly:

   so walker had only fainted that first timethe screams roused him
   and the axe did the rest?

   yes dr mcneills voice was low but he met his death from snakes
   just the same it was his fear working in two waysit made him faint
   and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to
   strike out when she thought she saw the snakedevil

   i thought for a moment

   and audreywasnt it queer how the curse of yig seemed to work itself
   out on her? i suppose the impression of hissing snakes had been fairly
   ground into her

   yes there were lucid spells at first but they got to be fewer and
   fewer her hair came white at the roots as it grew and later began to
   fall out the skin grew blotchy and when she died

   i interrupted with a start

   died? then what was thatthat thing downstairs?

   mcneill spoke gravely

   that is what was born to her threequarters of a year afterward there
   were three more of themtwo were even worsebut this is the only one
   that lived

   the descendant
   by hp lovecraft
   the descendant is a story fragment by american horror fiction writer h
   p lovecraft believed to have been written in 1927 it was first
   published in the journal leaves in 1938 after lovecrafts death 
   excerpted from the descendant (short story) on wikipedia the free
   encyclopedia
   8395the descendanthp lovecraft

   writing on what my doctor tells me is my deathbed my most hideous fear
   is that the man is wrong i suppose i shall seem to be buried next
   week but
         in london there is a man who screams when the church bells ring
   he lives all alone with his streaked cat in grays inn and people call
   him harmlessly mad his room is filled with books of the tamest and
   most puerile kind and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in
   their feeble pages all he seeks from life is not to think for some
   reason thought is very horrible to him and anything which stirs the
   imagination he flees as a plague he is very thin and grey and
   wrinkled but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he
   looks fear has its grisly claws upon him and a sound will make him
   start with staring eyes and sweatbeaded forehead friends and
   companions he shuns for he wishes to answer no questions those who
   once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him
   now he dropped them all years ago and no one feels sure whether he
   left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway it is
   a decade now since he moved into grays inn and of where he had been
   he would say nothing till the night young williams bought the
   necronomicon
         williams was a dreamer and only twentythree and when he moved
   into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic
   wind about the grey wizened man in the next room he forced his
   friendship where old friends dared not force theirs and marvelled at
   the fright that sat upon this gaunt haggard watcher and listener for
   that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt he watched
   and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears and strove
   every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay
   insipid novels and when the church bells rang he would stop his ears
   and scream and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison
   till the last peal died reverberantly away
         but try as williams would he could not make his neighbour speak
   of anything profound or hidden the old man would not live up to his
   aspect and manner but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle
   feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles; his voice every moment
   rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and
   incoherent falsetto that his learning was deep and thorough his most
   trivial remarks made abundantly clear; and williams was not surprised
   to hear that he had been to harrow and oxford later it developed that
   he was none other than lord northam of whose ancient hereditary castle
   on the yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when williams
   tried to talk of the castle and of its reputed roman origin he
   refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it he even
   tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts hewn
   out of the solid crag that frowns on the north sea was brought up
         so matters went till that night when williams brought home the
   infamous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred he had known of
   the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year when his dawning love of
   the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller
   in chandos street; and he had always wondered why men paled when they
   spoke of it the old bookseller had told him that only five copies were
   known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers
   against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by
   custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful
   blackletter but now at last he had not only found an accessible
   copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure it was at a
   jews shop in the squalid precincts of clare market where he had often
   bought strange things before and he almost fancied the gnarled old
   levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made
   the bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently
   visible and the price was so absurdly slight
         the one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him
   into transports and some of the diagrams set in the vague latin text
   excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain he
   felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin
   deciphering it and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste
   that the old jew chuckled disturbingly behind him but when at last it
   was safe in his room he found the combination of blackletter and
   debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist and reluctantly
   called on his strange frightened friend for help with the twisted
   mediaeval latin lord northam was simpering inanities to his streaked
   cat and started violently when the young man entered then he saw the
   volume and shuddered wildly and fainted altogether when williams
   uttered the title it was when he regained his senses that he told his
   story; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers lest
   his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide
   scattering to its ashes
         there must lord northam whispered have been something wrong at
   the start; but it would never have come to a head if he had not
   explored too far he was the nineteenth baron of a line whose beginings
   went uncomfortably far back into the pastunbelievably far if vague
   tradition could be heeded for there were family tales of a descent
   from presaxon times when a certain lunaeus gabinius capito military
   tribune in the third augustan legion then stationed at lindum in roman
   britain had been summarily expelled from his command for participation
   in certain rites unconnected with any known religion gabinius had the
   rumour ran come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met
   together and made the elder sign in the dark; strange folk whom the
   britons knew not save in fear and who were the last to survive from a
   great land in the west that had sunk leaving only the islands with the
   roths and circles and shrines of which stonehenge was the greatest
   there was no certainty of course in the legend that gabinius had
   built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a
   line which pict and saxon dane and norman were powerless to
   obliterate; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the
   bold companion and lieutenant of the black prince whom edward third
   created baron of northam these things were not certain yet they were
   often told; and in truth the stonework of northam keep did look
   alarmingly like the masonry of hadrians wall as a child lord northam
   had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle
   and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory
   for halfamorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no
   part of his waking experience he became a dreamer who found life tame
   and unsatisfying; a searcher for strange realms and relationships once
   familiar yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth
         filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in
   a fabric vast and ominous and that unknown demesnes press on and
   permeate the sphere of the known at every point northam in youth and
   young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult
   mystery nowhere however could he find ease and content; and as he
   grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more
   maddening to him during the `nineties he dabbled in satanism and at
   all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to
   promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying
   laws of nature books like ignatius donnellys commerical account of
   atlantis he absorbed with zest and a dozen obscure precursors of
   charles fort enthralled him with their vagaries he would travel
   leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder and
   once went into the desert of araby to seek a nameless city of faint
   report which no man has ever beheld there rose within him the
   tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed which if one
   found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled
   so dimly at the back of his memory it might be in the visible world
   yet it might be only in his mind and soul perhaps he held within his
   own halfexplored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to
   elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to
   the stars and to the infinities and eternities beyond them

   the despised pastoral
   by h p lovecraft
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   published july 1918
   9662the despised pastoralh p lovecraft

   among the many and complex tendencies observable in modern poetry or
   what answers for poetry in this age is a decided but unjust scorn of
   the honest old pastoral immortalised by theocritus and virgil and
   revived in our own literature by spencer

   nor is this unfavorable attitude confined alone to the formal eclogue
   whose classical elements are so well described and exemplified by mr
   pope whenever a versifier adorns his song with the pleasing and
   innocent imagery of this type of composition or borrows its mild and
   sweet atmosphere he is forthwith condemned as an irresponsible pedant
   and fossil by every littlewit critic in grubstreet

   modern bards in their endeavour to display with seriousness and minute
   verisimilitude the inward operations of the human mind and emotions
   have come to look down upon the simple description of ideal beauty or
   the straightforward presentation of pleasing images for no other
   purpose than to delight the fancy such themes they deem trivial and
   artificial and altogether unworthy of an art whose design they take to
   be the analysis and reproduction of nature in all her moods and
   aspects

   but in this belief the writer cannot but hold that our contemporaries
   are misjudging the true province and functions of poesy it was no
   starched classicist but the exceedingly unconventional edgar allen
   poe who roundly denounced the melancholy metaphysicians and maintained
   that true poetry has for its first object pleasure not truth and
   indefinite pleasure instead of definite pleasure intimating that its
   concern for the dull or ugly aspects of life is slight ideed that the
   american bard and critic was fundamentally just in his deductions
   seems well proved by a comparative survey of those poems of all ages
   which have lived and those which have fallen into deserved obscurity

   the english pastoral based upon the best models of antiquity depicts
   engaging scenes of arcadian simplicity which not only transport the
   imagination through their intrinsic beauty but recall to the scholarly
   mind the choicest remembrances of classical greece and rome though the
   combination of rural pursuits with polished sentiments and diction is
   patently artificial the beauty is not a whit less; nor do the
   conventional names phrases and images detract in the least from the
   quaint agreeableness of the whole the magic of this sort of verse is
   to any unprejudiced mind irresistible and capable of evoking a more
   deliciously placid and refreshing train of pictures in the imagination
   than may be obtained from any more realistic species of composition
   every untainted fancy begets ideal visions of which the pastoral forms
   a legitimate and artistically necessary reflection

   it is not impossible that the intellectual upheaval attendant upon the
   present conflict will bring about a general simplification and
   rectification of taste and an appreciation of the value of pure
   imaginary beauty in a world so full of actual misery which may combine
   to restore the despised pastoral to its proper station

   human knowledge his papers on vampirism ghouls and poltergeist
   phenomena were privately printed after rejection by many publishers he
   resigned from the society for psychical research in 1900 after a series
   of peculiarly bitter controversies

   at various times mr typer traveled extensively sometimes dropping out
   of site for long periods he is known to have visited obscure spots in
   nepal india tibet and indochina and passed most of the year 1899
   on mysterious easter island the extensive search for mr typer after
   his disappearance yielded no results and his estate was divided among
   distant cousins in new york city

   the diary herewith presented was allegedly found in the ruins of a
   large country house near attica ny which had borne a curiously
   sinister reputation for generations before its collapse the edifice
   was very old antedating the general white settlement of the region
   and had formed the home of a strange and secretive family named van der
   heyl which had migrated from albany in 1746 under a curious cloud of
   witchcraft suspicion the structure probably dated from about 1760

   of the history of the van der heyls very little is known they remained
   entirely aloof from their normal neighbors employed negro servants
   brought directly from africa and speaking little english and educated
   their children privately and at european colleges those of them who
   went out into the world were soon lost to sight though not before
   gaining evil repute for association with black mass groups and cults of
   even darker significance

   around the dreaded house a straggling village arose populated by
   indians and later by renegades from the surrounding contry which bore
   the dubious name of chorazin of the singular hereditary strains which
   afterward appeared in the mixed chorazin villagers several monographs
   have been written by ethnologists just behind the village and in
   sight of the van der heyl house is a steep hill crowned with a
   peculiar ring of ancient standing stones which the iroquois always
   regarded with fear and loathing the origin and nature of the stones
   whose date according to archeological and climatalogical evidence
   must be fabulously early is a problem still unsolved

   from about 1795 onward the legends of the incoming pioneers and later
   population have much to say about strange cries and chants proceeding
   at certain seaons from chorazin and from the great house and hill of
   standing stones; though there is reason to suppose that the noises
   ceased about 1872 when the entire van der heyl household  servants
   and all  suddenly and simultaneously disappeared

   thenceforward the house was deserted; for other disastrous events 
   including three unexplained deaths five disappearances and four cases
   of sudden insanity  occurred when later owners and interested visitors
   attempted to stay in it the house village and extensive rural areas
   on all sides reverted to the state and were auctioned off in the
   absence of discoverable van der heyl heirs since about 1890 the owners
   (successively the late charles a shields and his son oscar s shields
   of buffalo) have left the entire property in a state of absolute
   neglect and have warned all inquirers not to visit the region

   of those known to have approached the house during the last forty
   years most were occult students police officers newspaper men and
   odd characters from abroad among the latter was a mysterious eurasian
   probably from chochinchina whose later appearance with blank mind and
   bizarre mutilations excited wide press notice in 1903

   mr typers diary  a book about 6 x 3 1/2 inches in size with tough
   paper and an oddly durable binding of thin sheet metal  was discovered
   in the possession of one of the decadent chorazin villagers on november
   16 1935 by a state policeman sent to investigate the rumored collapse
   of the deserted van der heyl mansion the house had indeed fallen
   obviously from sheer age and decrepitude in the severe gale of
   november 12 disintergration was peculiarly complete and no thorough
   search of the ruins could be made for several weeks john eagle the
   swarthy simianfaced indianlike villager who had the diary said
   that he found the book quite near the surface of the debris in what
   must have been an upper front room

   very little of the contents of the house could be identified though an
   enormous and astonishingly solid brick vault in the cellar (whose
   ancient iron door had to be blasted open because of the strangely
   figured and perversely tenacious lock) remained intact and presented
   several puzzling features for one thing the walls were covered with
   still undeciphered hieroglyphs roughly incised in the brickwork
   another peculiarity was a huge circular aperture in the rear of the
   vault blocked by a cavein evidently caused by the collapse of the
   house

   but strangest of all was the apparently recent deposit of some fetid
   slimy pitchblack substance on the flagstoned floor extending in a
   yardbroad irregular line with one end at the blocked circular
   aperture those who first opened the vault declared that the place
   smelled like the snakehouse at a zoo

   the diary which was apparently designed solely to cover an
   investigation of the dreaded van der heyl house by the vanished mr
   typer has been proved by handwriting experts to be genuine the script
   shows signs of increasing nervous strain as it progresses toward the
   end in places becoming almost illegible chorazin villagers  whose
   stupidity and taciturnity baffle all students of the region and its
   secrets  admit no recollection of mr typer as distinguished from
   other rash visitors to the dreaded house

   the text of the diary is here given verbatim and without comment how
   to interpret it and what other than the writers madness to infer
   from it the reader must decide for himself only the future can tell
   what its value may be in solving a generationold mystery it may be
   remarked that genealogists confirm mr typers belated memory in the
   matter of adriaen sleght

   the diary

   arrived here about 6 pm had to walk all the way from attica in the
   teeth of an oncoming storm for no one would rent me a horse or rig
   and i cant run an automobile this place is even worse than i had
   expected and i dread what is coming even though i long at the same
   time to learn the secret all too soon will come the night  the old
   walpurgis sabbat horror  and after that time in wales i know what to
   look for whatever comes i shall not flinch prodded by some
   unfathomable urge i have given my whole life to the quest of unholy
   mysteries i came here for nothing else and will not quarrel with
   fate

   it was very dark when i got here though the sun had by no means set
   the stormclouds were the densest i had ever seen and i could not have
   found my way but for the lightningflashes the village is a hateful
   little backwater and its few inhabitants no better than idiots one
   of them saluted me in a queer way as if he knew me i could see very
   little of the landscape  just a small swamp valley of strange brown
   weedstalks and dead fungi surrounded by scraggly evilly twisted trees
   with bare boughs but behind the village is a dismallooking hill on
   whose summit is a circle of great stones with another stone at the
   center that without question is the vile primordial thing v   
   told me about the n    estbat

   the great house lies in the midst of a park all overgrown with
   curiouslooking briars i could scarcely break through and when i did
   the vast age and decrepitude of the building almost stopped me from
   entering the place looked filthy and diseased and i wondered how so
   leprous a building could hang together it is wooden; and though its
   original lines are hidden by a bewildering tangle of wings added at
   various dates i think it was first built in the square colonial
   fashion of new england probably that was easier to build than a dutch
   stone house  and then too i recall that dirck van der heyls wife
   was from salem a daughter of the unmentionable abaddon corey there
   was a small pillared porch and i got under it just as the storm burst
   it was a fiendish tempest  black as midnight with rain in sheets
   thunder and lightning like the day of general dissolution and a wind
   that actually clawed at me

   the door was unlocked so i took out my electric torch and went inside
   dust was inches thick on floor and furniture and the place smelled
   like a moldcaked tomb there was a hall reaching all the way through
   and a curving staircase on the right

   i plowed my way upstairs and selected this front room to camp out in
   the whole place seems fully furnished though most of the furniture is
   breaking down this is written at 8 oclock after a cold meal from my
   travelingcase after this the village people will bring me supplies
   though they wont agree to come any closer than the ruins of the park
   gate until (as they say) later i wish i could get rid of an unpleasant
   feeling of familiarity with this place

   later

   i am conscious of several presences in this house one in particular is
   decidedly hostile toward me  a malevolent will which is seeking to
   break down my own and overcome me i must not countenance this for an
   instant but must use all my forces to resist it it is appallingly
   evil and definitely nonhuman i think it must be allied to powers
   outside earth  powers in the spaces behind time and beyond the
   universe it towers like a colossus bearing out what is said in the
   aklo writings there is such a feeling of vast size connected with it
   that i wonder these chambers can contain its bulk  and yet it has no
   visible bulk its age must be unutterably vast  shockingly
   indescribably so

   april 18

   slept very little last night at 3 am a strange creeping wind began
   to pervade the whole region ever rising until the house rocked as if
   in a typhoon as i went down the staircase to see the rattling front
   door the darkness took halfvisible forms in my imagination just below
   the landing i was pushed violently from behind  by the wind i
   suppose though i could have sworn i saw the dissolving outlines of a
   gigantic black paw as i turned quickly about i did not lose my
   footing but safely finished the descent and shot the heavy bolt of the
   dangerously shaking door

   i had not meant to explore the house before dawn; yet now unable to
   sleep again and fired with mixed terror and curiousity i felt
   reluctant to postpone my search with my powerful torch i plowed
   through the dust to the great south parlor where i knew the portraits
   would be there they were just as v    had said and as i seemed to
   know from some obscurer source as well some were so blackened and
   dustclouded that i could make little or nothing of them but from those
   i could trace i recognized that they were indeed of the hateful line of
   the van der heyls some of the paintings seemed to suggest faces i had
   known; but just what faces i could not recall

   the outlines of that frightful hybrid joris  spawned in 1773 by
   dircks youngest daughter  were clearest of all and i could trace the
   green eyes and the serpent look in his face every time i shut off the
   flashlight that face would seem to glow in the dark until i half
   fancied it shone with a faint greenish light of its own the more i
   looked the more evil it seemed and i turned away to avoid
   hallucinations of changing expression

   but that to which i turned was even worse the long dour face small
   closely set eyes and swinelike features identified it at once even
   though the artist had striven to make the snout look as human as
   possible this was what v    had whispered about as i stared in
   horror i thought the eyes took on a reddish glow and for a moment the
   background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scene 
   a lone bleak moor beneath a dirty yellow sky whereon grew a
   wretchedlooking blackthorn bush fearing for my sanity i rushed from
   that accursed gallery to the dustcleared corner upstairs where i have
   my camp

   later

   decided to explore some more of the labyrinthine wings of the house by
   daylight i cannot be lost for my footprints are distinct in the
   ankledeep dust and i can trace other identifying marks when
   necessary it is curious how easily i learn the intricate windings of
   the corridors followed a long outflung northerly ell to its
   extremity and came to a locked door which i forced beyond was a very
   small room quite crowded with furniture and with the panelling badly
   wormeaten on the outer wall i spied a black space behind the rotting
   woodwork and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to
   unknown inky depths it was a steeply inclined chute or tunnel without
   steps or handholds and i wondered what its use could have been

   above the fireplace was a moldy painting which i found on close
   inspection to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late
   eighteenth century the face is of classic beauty yet with the most
   fiendishly evil expression which i have ever known the human
   countenance to bear not merely callousness greed and cruelty but
   some quality hideous beyond human comprehension seems to sit upon those
   finely carved features and as i looked it seemed to me that the artist
    or the slow processes of mold and decay  had imparted to that pallid
   complexion a sickly greenish cast and the least suggestion of an
   almost imperceptibly scaly texture later i ascended to the attic
   where i found several chests of strange books  many of utterly alien
   aspects in letters and in physical form alike one contained variants
   of the aklo formulae which i had never known to exist i have not yet
   examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairs

   april 19

   there are certainly unseen presences here even though the dust bears
   no footprints but my own cut a path through the briars yeseterday to
   the park gate where my supplies are left but this morning i found it
   closed very odd since the bushes are barely stirring with spring sap
   agin i had that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the
   chambers can scarely contain it this time i feel more than one of the
   presences is of such a size and i know now that the third aklo ritual
    which i found in that book in the attic yesterday  would make such
   being solid and visible whether i shall dare to try this
   materialization remains to be seen the perils are great

   last night i began to glimpse evanescent shadowfaces and forms in the
   dim corners of the halls and chambers  faces and forms so hideous and
   loathsome that i dare not describe them they seemed allied in
   substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me down the stairs
   night before last and must of course be phantoms of my disturbed
   imagination what i am seeking would not be quite like these things i
   have seen the paw again sometimes alone and sometimes with its mate
   but i have resolved to ignore all such phenomena

   early this afternoon i explored the cellar for the first time
   descending by a ladder found in a storeroom since the wooden steps
   had rotted away the whole place is a mass of nitrous encrustations
   with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects have
   disintegrated at the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to
   extend under the northerly ell where i found the little locked room
   and at the end of this is a heavy brick wall with a locked iron door
   apparently belonging to a vault of some sort this wall and door bear
   evidences of the eighteenth century workmanship and must be
   contemporary with the oldest additions to the house  clearly
   prerevolutionary on the lock which is obviously older than the rest
   of the ironwork are engraved certain symbols which i cannot decipher

   v    had not told me about this vault it fills me with a greater
   disquiet than anything else i have seen for every time i approach it i
   have an almost irresistible impulse to listen for something hitherto
   no untoward sounds have marked my stay in this malign place as i left
   the cellar i wished devoutly that the steps were still there; for my
   progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow i do not want to go
   down there again  and yet some evil genius urges me to try it at night
   if i would learn what is to be learned

   april 20

   i have sounded the depths of horror  only to be made aware of still
   lower depths last night the temptation was too strong and in the
   black small hours i descended once more into that nitrous hellish
   cellar with my flashlight tiptoeing among the amorphous heaps to that
   terrible brick wall and locked door i made no sound and refrained
   from whispering any of the incantations i knew but i listened with mad
   intentness

   at last i heard the sounds from beyond those barred plates of sheet
   iron the menacing padding and muttering as of gigantic nightthings
   within then too there was a damnable slithering as of a vast
   serpent or seabeast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor
   nearly paralyzed with firght i glanced at the huge rusty lock and at
   the alien cryptic hieroglyphs graven upon it they were signs i could
   not recognize and something in their vaguely mongoloid technique
   hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity at times i fancied
   i could see them glowing with a greenish light

   i turned to flee but found that vision of the titan paws before me
   the great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as i gazed
   out of the cellars evil blackness they stretched with shadowy hints
   of scaly wrists beyond them and with a waxing malignant will guiding
   their horrible gropings then i heard from behind me  within that
   abominable vault  a fresh burst of muffled reverberations which seemed
   to echo from far horizons like distant thunder impelled by this
   greater fear i advanced toward the shadowy paws with my flashlight and
   saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam then up the
   ladder i raced torch between my teeth nor did i rest till i had
   regained my upstairs camp

   what is to be my ultimate end i dare not imagine i came as a seeker
   but now i know that something is seeking me i could not leave if i
   wished this morning i tried to go to the gate for my supplies but
   found the briars twisted tightly in my path it was the same in every
   direction  behind and on all sides of the house in places the brown
   barbed vines had uncurled to astonishing heights forming a steellike
   hedge against my egress the villagers are connected with all this
   when i went indoors i found my supplies in the great front hall though
   without any clue as to how they came there i am sorry now that i swept
   the dust away i shall scatter some more and see what prints are left

   this afternoon i read some of the books in the great shadowy library at
   the rear of the ground floor and formed certain suspicions which i
   cannot bear to mention i had never seen the text of the pnakotic
   manuscripts or of the eltdown shards before and would not have come
   here had i known what they contain i believe it is too late now  for
   the awful sabbat is only ten days away it is for that night of horror
   that they are saving me

   april 21

   i have been studying the portraits again some have names attached and
   i noticed one  of an evilfaced woman painted some two centuries ago
    which puzzled me it bore the name of trintje van der heyl sleght
   and i have a distinct impression that i once met the name of sleght
   before in some significant connection it was not horrible then
   though it becomes so now i must rack my brain for the clue

   the eyes of the pictures haunt me is it possible that some of them are
   emerging more distinctly from their shrouds of dust and decay and mold?
   the serpentfaced and swinefaced warlocks stare horribly at me from
   their blackened frames and a score of other hybrid faces are beginning
   to peer out of shadowy backgrounds there is a hideous look of family
   resemblance in them all and that which is human is more horrible than
   that which is nonhuman i wish they reminded me less of other faces 
   faces i have known in the past they were an accursed line and
   cornelis of leydon was the worst of them it was he who broke down the
   barrier after his father had found that other key i am sure that v  
    knows only a fragment of the horrible truth so that i am indeed
   unprepared and defenseless what of the line before old class? what he
   did in 1591 could never have been done without generations of evil
   heritage or some link with the outside and what of the branches this
   monstrous line has sent forth? are they scattered over the world all
   awaiting their common heritage of horror? i must recall the place where
   i once so particularly noticed the name of sleght

   i wish i could be sure that those pictures stay always in their frames
   for several hours now i have been seeing momentary presences like the
   earlier paws and shadowfaces and forms but closely duplicating some
   of the ancient portraits somehow i can never glimpse a presence and
   the portrait it resembles at the same time  the light is always wrong
   for one or the other or else the presence and the portrait are in
   different rooms

   perhaps as i have hoped the presences are mere figments of
   imagination but i cannot be sure now some are female and of the same
   helling beauty as the picture in the little locked room some are like
   no portrait i have seen yet make me feel that their painted features
   lurk unrecognized beneath the mold and soot of canvases i cannot
   decipher a few i desperately fear have approached materialization in
   solid or semisolid form  and some have a dreaded and unexplained
   familiarity

   there is one woman who in full loveliness excels all the rest her
   poisonous charms are like a honeyed flower growing on the brink of
   hell when i look at her closely she vanishes only to reappear later
   her face has a greenish cast and now and then i fancy i can spy a
   suspicion of the squamous in its smooth texture who is she? is she
   that being who dwelt in the little locked room a century and more ago?

   my supplies were again left in the front hall  that clearly is to be
   the custom i had sprinkled dust about to catch footprints but this
   morning the whole hall was swept clean by some unknown agency

   april 22

   this has been a day of horrible discovery i explored the cobwebbed
   attic again and found a carved crumbling chest  plainly from holland
    full of blasphemous books and papers far older than any hitherto
   encountered here there was a greek necronomicon a normanfrench livre
   deibon and a first edition of old ludvig prinns de vermis mysteriis
   but the old bound manuscript was the worst it was in low latin and
   full of the strange crabbed handwriting of claes van der heyl being
   evidently the diary or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580 when
   i unfastened the blackened silver clasp and opened the yellowed leaves
   a colored drawing fluttered out  the likeness of a monstrous creature
   resembling nothing so much as a squid beaked and tentacled with great
   yellow eyes and with certain abominable approximations to the human
   form in its contours

   i had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form on
   the paws feet and headtentacles were curious claws  reminding me of
   the colossal shadowshapes which had groped so horribly in my path 
   while the entity as a whole sat upon a great thronelike pedastal
   inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely chinese cast about both
   writing and image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and
   pervasive that i could not think it the product of any one world or
   age rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the evil in
   unbounded space throughout the eons past and to come  and those
   eldritch symbols be vile sentitent ikons endows with a morbid life of
   their own and ready to wrest themselves from the parchment for the
   readers destruction to the meaning of that monster and of those
   hieroglpyhs i had no clue but i knew that both had been traced with a
   hellish precision and for no namable purpose as i studdied the leering
   characters their kinship to the symbols on that ominous lock in the
   cellar became more and more manifest i left the picture in the attic
   for never could sleep come to me with such a thing near by

   all the afternoon and evening i read in the manuscript book of old
   claes van der heyl; and what i read will cloud and make horrible
   whatever period of life lies ahead of me the genesis of the world and
   of previous worlds unfolded itself before my eyes i learned of the
   city shamballah built by the lemurians fifty million years ago yet
   inviolate still behind its wall of psychic force in the eastern dester
   i learned of the book of dzyan whose first six chapters antedate the
   earth and which was old when the lords of venus came through space in
   their ships to civilize our planet and i saw recorded in writing for
   the first time that name which others had spoken to me in whispers and
   which i had known in a closer and more horrible way  the shunned and
   dread name of yianho

   in several places i was help up by passages requiring a key
   eventually from various allusions i gathered that old claes had not
   dared to embody all his knowledge in one book but had left certain
   points for another neither volume can be wholly intelligible without
   its fellow; hence i have resolved to find the second one if it lies
   anywhere within this accursed house though plainly a prisoner i have
   not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown; and am determined to probe
   the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comes

   april 23

   searched all the morning for the second diary and found it about noon
   in a desk in the little locked room like the first it is in claes van
   der heyls barbarous latin and it seems to consist of disjointed notes
   referring to various sections of the other glancing through the
   leaves i spied at once the abhorred name of yianho  of yianho that
   lost and hidden city wherein brood eonold secrets and of which dim
   memories older than the body lurk behind the minds of all men it was
   repeated many times and the text around it was strewn with
   crudelydrawn hieroglyphs plainly akin to those on the pedestal in that
   hellish drawing i had seen here clearly lay the key to that
   monstrous tentacled shape and its forbidden message with this
   knowledge i ascended the creaking stairs to the attic of cobwebs and
   horror

   when i tried to open the attic door it stuck as never before several
   times it resisted every effort to open it and when at last it gave way
   i had a distinct feeling that some colossal unseen shape had suddenly
   released it  a shape that soared away on nonmaterial but audibly
   beating wings when i found the horrible drawing i felt that it was not
   precisely where i left it applying the key in the other book i soon
   saw that the latter was no instant guide to the secret it was only a
   clue  a clue to a secret too black to be left lightly guarded it
   would take hours  perhaps days  to extract the awful message

   shall i live long enough to learn the secret? the shadowy black arms
   and paws haunt my vision more and more now and seem even more titanic
   than at first nor am i ever long free from those vague unhuman
   presences whose nebulous bulk seems too vast for the chambers to
   contain and now and then the grotesque evanescent faces and forms
   and the mocking portraitshapes troop before me in bewildering
   confusion

   truly there are terrible primal arcana of earth which had better be
   left unknown and unevoked; dread secrets which have nothing to do with
   man and which man may learn only in exchange for peace and sanity;
   cryptic truths which make the knower evermore an alien among his kind
   and cause him to walk alone on earth likewise there are dread
   survivals of things older and more potent than man; things that have
   blasphemously straggled down through the eons to ages never ment for
   them; monstrous entities that have lain sleeping endlessly in
   incredible crypts and remote caverns outside the laws of reason and
   causation and ready to be waked by such blasphemers as shall know
   their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwords

   april 24

   studied the picture and the key all day in the attic at sunset i heard
   strange sounds of a sort not encountered before and seeming to come
   from far away listening i realized that they must flow from that
   queer abrupt hill with the circle of standing stones which lies behind
   the village and some distance north of the house i had heard that
   there was a path from the house leading up that hill to the primal
   cromlech and had suspected that at certain seasons the van der heyls
   had much occasion to use it; but the whole matter had hitherto lain
   latent in my consciousness the present sounds consisted of a shrill
   piping intermingled with a peculiar and hideous sort of hissing or
   whistling a bizarre alien kind of music like nothing which the
   annals of earth describe it was very faint and soon faded but the
   matter has set met thinking it is toward the hill that the long
   northerly ell with the secret chute and the locked brick vault under
   it extend can there be any connection which has so far eluded me?

   april 25

   i have made a peculiar and disturbing discovery about the nature of my
   imprisonment drawn toward the hill by a sinsiter fascination i found
   the briars giving way before me but in that direction only there is a
   ruined gate and beneath the bushes the traces of an old path no doubt
   exist the briars extend partway up and all around the hill though
   the summit with the standing stones bears only a curious growth of moss
   and stunted grass i climbed the hill and spent several hours there
   noticing a strange wind which seems always to sweep around the
   forbidding monoliths and which sometimes seems to whisper in an oddly
   articulate though darkly cryptic fashion

   these stones both in color and texture resemble nothing i have seen
   elsewhere they are neither brown nor gray but rather of a dirty
   yellow merging into an evil green and having a suggestion of
   chameleonlike variability their texture is queerly like that of a
   scaled serpent and is inexplicably nauseous to the touch  being as
   cold and clammy as the skin of a toad or other reptile near the
   central menhir is a singular stonerimmed hollow which i cannot
   explain but which may possibly form the entrance to a longchoked well
   or tunnel when i sought to descend the hill at points away from the
   house i found the briars intercepting me as before though the path
   toward the house was easily retraceable

   april 26

   up on the hill again this evening and found that windy whispering much
   more distinct the almost angry humming came close to actual speech of
   a vague sibilant sort and reminded me of the strange piping chant i
   had heard from a far after sunset there came a curious flash of
   premature summer lightning on the northern horizon followed almost at
   once by a queer detonation high in the fading sky something about this
   phenomenon disturbed me greatly and i could not escape the impression
   that the noise ended in a kind of unhuman hissing speech which trailed
   off into guttural cosmic laughter is my mind tottering at last or has
   my unwarranted curiousity evoked unheardof horrors from the twilight
   spaces? the sabbat is close at hand now what will be the end?

   april 27

   at last my dreams are to be realized! whether or not my life or spirit
   or body will be claimed i shall enter the gateway! progress in
   deciphering those crucial hieroglpyhs in the picture has been slow but
   this afternoon i hit upon the final clue by evening i knew their
   meaning  and that meaning can apply in only one way to the things i
   have encountered in this house

   there is beneath this house  sepulchered i know not where  an ancient
   one who will show me the gateway i would enter and give me the lost
   signs and words i shall need how long it has lain buried here
   forgotten save by those who reared the stone on the hill and by those
   who later sought out this place and built this house i cannot
   conjecture it was in search of this thing beyond question that
   hendrik van der heyl came to newnetherland in 1638 men of this earth
   know it not save in the secret whispers of the fearshaken few who
   have found or inherited the key no human eye has even yet glimpsed it
    unless perhaps the vanished wizards of this house delved farther
   than has been guessed

   with knowledge of the symbols came likewise a mastery of the seven lost
   signs of terror and a tacit recognition of the hideous and unutterable
   words of fear all that remains for me to accomplish is the chant which
   will transfigure that forgotten one who is guardian of the ancient
   gateway i marvel much at the chant it is composed of strange and
   repellent gutturals and disturbing sibilants resembling no language i
   have ever encountered even in the blackest chapters of the livre
   deibon when i visited the hill at sunset i tried to read it aloud
   but evoked in response only a vague sinister rumbling on the far
   horizon and a thin cloud of elemental dust that writhed and whirld
   like some evil living thing perhaps i do not pronounce the alien
   syllables correctly or perhaps it is only on the sabbat  that hellish
   sabbat for which the powers in this house are without question holding
   me  that the great transfiguration can occur

   had an odd spell of fright this morning i thought for a moment that i
   recalled where i had seen that baffling name of sleght before and the
   prospect of realization filled me with unutterable horror

   april 28

   today dark ominous clouds have hovered intermittently over the circle
   on this hill i have noticed such clouds several times before but
   their contours and arrangements now hold a fresh significance they are
   snakelike and fantastic and curiously like the evil shadowshapes i
   have seen in the house they float in a circle around the primal
   cromlech revolving repeatedly as though endowed with a sinister life
   and purpose i could swear that they give forth an angry murmering
   after some fifteen minutes they sail slowly away ever to the eastward
   like the units of a straggling batallion are they indeed those dread
   ones whom solomon knew of old  those giant black beings whose number
   is legion and whose tread doth shake the earth?

   i have been rehearsing the chant that will transfigure the nameless
   thing; yet strange fears assail me even when i utter the syllables
   under my breath piercing all evidence together i have now discovered
   that the only way to it is throught the locked cellar vault that vault
   was built with a hellish purpose and must cover the hidden burrow
   leading to the immemorial lair what guardians live endlessly within
   flourishing from century to century on an unknown nourishment only the
   mad may conjecture the warlocks of this house who called them out of
   inner earth have known them only too well as the shocking portraits
   and memories of the place reveal

   what troubles me most is the limited nature of the chant it evokes the
   nameless one yet provides no method for the control of that which is
   evoked there are of course the general signs and gestures but
   whether they will prove effective toward such an one remains to be
   seen still the rewards are great enough to justify any danger and i
   could not retreat if i would since an unknown force plainly urges me
   on

   i have discovered one more obstacle since the locked cellar vault must
   be traversed the key to that place must be found the lock is far too
   strong for forcing that the key is somewhere hereabouts cannot be
   doubted but the time before the sabbat is very short i must search
   diligently and thoroughly it will take courage to unlock that iron
   door for what prisoned horrors may not lurk within?

   later

   i have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two but late this
   afternoon i again descended to those forbidding precincts

   at first all was silent but within five minutes the menacing padding
   and muttering began once more beyond the iron door this time it was
   loud and more terrifying than on any previous occasion and i likewise
   recognized the slithering that bespoke some monstrous seabeast  now
   swifter and nervously intensified as if the thing were striving to
   force its way through the portal where i stood

   as the pacing grew louder more restless and more sinister there
   began to pound through it those hellish and more unidentifiable
   reverberations which i had heard on my second visit to the cellar 
   those muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons
   like distant thunder now however their volume was magnified an
   hundredfold and their timbre freighted with new and terrifying
   implications i can compare the sound to nothing more aptly than the
   roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age when primal
   horrors roamed the earth and valusias serpentmen laid the
   foundationstones of evil magic to such a roar  but swelled to
   deafening heights reached by no known organic throat  was this
   shocking sound akin dare i unlock the door and face the onslaught of
   what lies beyond?

   april 29

   the key to the vault is found i came upon it this noon in the little
   locked room  buried beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk
   as if some belated effort to conceal it had been made it was wrapped
   in a crumbling newspaper dated october 31 1872; but there was an inner
   wrapping of dried skin  evidently the hide of some unknown reptile 
   which bore a low latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of
   the notebooks i found as i had thought the lock and key were vastly
   older than the vault old claes van der heyl had them ready for
   something he or his descendants meant to do  and how much older than
   he they were i could not estimate deciphering the latin message i
   trembled in a fresh access of clutching terror and nameless awe

   the secrets of the monstrous primal ones; ran the crabbed text
   whose cryptic words relate the hidden things that were before man; the
   things no one of earth should learn lest peace be for ever forfeited;
   shall be me never suffer revelation to yianho that lost and
   forbidden city of countless eons whose place may not be told i have
   been in the veritable flesh of this body as none other among the
   living has been therein have i found and thence have i borne away
   that knowledge which i would glady lose though i may not i have
   learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged and must call out of
   the earth that which should not be waked nor called and what is sent
   to follow me will not sleep till i or those after me have found and
   done what is to be found and done

   that which i have awaked and borne away with me i may not part with
   again so it is written in the book of hidden things that which i have
   willed to be has twined its dreadful shape around me and  if i live
   not to do its bidding  around those children born and unborn who shall
   come after me until the bidding be done strange may be their
   joinings and awful the aid they may summon till the end be reached
   into lands unknown and dim must the seeking go and a house must be
   built for the outer guardians

   this is the key to that lock which was given me in the dreadful
   eonold and forbidden city of yianho; the lock which i or mine must
   place upon the vestibule of that which is to be found and may the
   lords of yaddith succor me  or him  who must set that lock in place
   or turn the key thereof

   such was the message  a message which once i had read it i seemed to
   have known before now as i write these words the key is before me i
   gaze on it with mixed dread and longing and cannot find words to
   describe its aspect it is of the same unknown subtly greenish frosted
   metal as the lock; a metal best compared to brass tarnished with
   verdigris its design is alien and fantastic and the coffinshaped end
   of the ponderous bulk leaves no doubt of the lock it was meant to fit
   the handle roughly forms a strange nonhuman image whose exact
   outlines and identity cannot now be traced upon holding it for any
   length of time i seem to feel an alien anomalous life in the cold
   metal  a quickening or pulsing too feeble for ordinary recognition

   below the eidolon is graven a faint eonworn legend in those
   blasphemous chineselike hieroglyphs i have come to know so well i
   can only make out the beginning  the words: my vengeance lurks   
    before the text fades to insistinctness there is some fatality in
   this timely finding of the key  for tomorrow night comes the hellish
   sabbat but strangely enough amidst all this hideous expectancy that
   question of the sleght name bothers me more and more why should i
   dread to find it linked with the van der heyls?

   walpurgiseve  april 30

   the time has come i waked last night to see the key glowing with a
   lurid greenish radiance  that same morbid green which i have seen in
   the eyes and skin of certain portraits here on the shocking lock and
   key on the monstrous menhirs of the hill and in a thousand other
   recesses of my consciousness there were strident whispers in the air 
   sibilant whisperings like those of the wind around that dreadful
   cromlech something spoke to me out of the frore [?] aether of space
   and it said the hour falls it is an omen and i laugh at my own
   fears have i not the dread words and the seven lost signs of terror 
   the power coercive of any dweller in the cosmos or in the unknown
   darkened spaces? i will no longer hesistate

   the heavens are very dark as if a terrific storm were coming on  a
   storm even greater than that of the night when i reached here nearly a
   fortnight ago from the village less than a mile away i hear a queer
   and unwonted babbling it is as i thought  these poor degraded idiots
   are within the secret and keep the awful sabbat on the hill

   here in the house the shadows gather densely in the darkness the sky
   before me almost glows with a greenish light of its own i have no yet
   been to the cellar it is better that i wait lest the sound of that
   muttering and padding  those slitherings and muffled reverberations 
   unnerve me before i can unlock the fateful door

   of what i shall encounter and what i must do i have only the most
   general idea shall i find my task in the vault itself or must i
   burrow deeper into the nighted heart of our planet? there are things i
   do not yet understand  or at least prefer not to understand  despite
   a dreadful increasing and inexplicable sense of bygone familiarity
   with this fearsome house that chute for instance leading down from
   the little locked room but i think i know why the wing with the vault
   extends toward the hill

   6 pm

   looking out the north windows i can see a group of villagers on the
   hill they seem unaware of the lowering sky and are digging near the
   great central menhir it occurs to me that they are working on that
   stonerimmed hollow place which looks like a longchoked tunnel
   entrance what is to come? how much of the olden sabbat rites have
   these people retained? that key glows horribly  it is not imagination
   dare i use it as it must be used? another matter has greatly disturbed
   me glancing nervously through a book in the library i came upon an
   ampler form of the name that has teased my memory so sorely: trintje
   wife of adriaen sleght the adriaen leads me to the very brink of
   recollection

   midnight

   horror is unleashed but i must not weaken the storm has broken with
   pandemoniac fury and lightning has struck the hill three times yet
   the hybrid malformed villagers are gathering within the cromlech i
   can see them in the almost constant flashes the great standing stones
   loom up shockingly and have a dull green luminosity that reveals them
   even when the lightning is not there the peals of thunder are
   deafening and every one seems to be horribly answered from some
   indeterminate direction as i write the creatures on the hill have
   begun to chant and howl and scream in a degraded halfsimian version
   of the ancient ritual rain pours down like a flood yet they leap and
   emit sounds in a kind of diabolic ecstacy

   iä shubniggurath! the goat with a thousand young!

   but the worst thing is within the house even at this height i have
   begun to hear sounds from the cellar it is the padding and muttering
   and slithering and muffled reverberations within the vault   

   memories come and go that name adriaen sleght pounds oddly at my
   consciousness dirck van der heyls soninlaw    his child old
   dircks granddaughter and abaddon coreys greatgranddaughter   

   later

   merciful god! at last i know where i saw that name i know and am
   transfixed with horror all is lost  

   the key has begun to fell warm as my left hand nervously clutches it
   at times that vague quickening or pulsing is so distinct that i can
   almost feel the living metal move it came from yianho for a terrible
   purpose and to me  who all too late know the thing stream of van der
   heyl blood that trickles down through the sleghts into my own lineage 
   has descended the hideous task of fulfilling that purpose   

   my courage and curiousity wane i know the horror that lies beyond that
   iron door what if claes van der heyl was my ancestor  need i expiate
   his nameless sin? i will not  i swear i will not!    (the writing
   here grows indistinct)    too late  cannot help self  black paws
   materialize  am dragged away toward the cellar

   and d w rimel

   i awoke abruptly from a horrible dream and stared wildly about then
   seeing the high arched ceiling and the narrow stained windows of my
   friends room a flood of uneasy revelation coursed over me; and i knew
   that all of andrews hopes had been realized i lay supine in a large
   bed the posts of which reared upward in dizzy perspective; while on
   vast shelves about the chamber were the familiar books and antiques i
   was accustomed to seeing in that secluded corner of the crumbling and
   ancient mansion which had formed our joint home for many years on a
   table by the wall stood a huge candelabrum of early workmanship and
   design and the usual light windowcurtains had been replaced by
   hangings of somber black which took on a faint ghostly luster in the
   dying light

   i recalled forcibly the events preceding my confinement and seclusion
   in this veritable medieval fortress they were not pleasant and i
   shuddered anew when i remembered the couch that had held me before my
   tenancy of the present one  the couch that everyone supposed would be
   my last memory burned afresh regarding those hideous circumstances
   which had compelled me to choose between a true death and a
   hypothetical one  with a later reanimation by therapeutic methods
   known only to my comrade marshall andrews the whole thing had begun
   when i returned from the orient a year before and discovered to my
   utter horror that i had contracted leprosy while abroad i had known
   that i was taking grave chances in caring for my stricken brother in
   the philippines but no hint of my own affliction appeared until i
   returned to my native land andrews himself had made the discovery and
   kept it from me as long as possible; but our close acquaintance soon
   disclosed the awful truth

   at once i was quartered in our ancient abode atop the crags overlooking
   crumbling hampden from whose musty halls and quaint arched doorways i
   was never permitted to go forth it was a terrible existence with the
   yellow shadow hanging constantly over me; yet my friend never faltered
   in his faith taking care not to contract the dread scourge but
   meanwhile making life as pleasant and comfortable as possible his
   widespread though somewhat sinister fame as a surgeon prevented any
   authority from discovering my plight and shipping me away

   it was after nearly a year of this seclusion  late in august  that
   andrews decided on a trip to the west indies  to study native
   medical methods he said i was left in care of venerable simes the
   household factotum so far no outward signs of the disease had
   developed and i enjoyed a tolerable though almost completely private
   existence during my colleagues absence it was during this time that i
   read many of the tomes andrews had acquired in the course of his twenty
   years as a surgeon and learned why his reputation though locally of
   the highest was just a bit shady for the volumes included any number
   of fanciful subjects hardly related to modern medical knowledge:
   treatises and unauthoritative articles on monstrous experiments in
   surgery; accounts of the bizarre effects of glandular transplantation
   and rejuvenation in animals and men alike; brochures on attempted brain
   transference and a host of other fanatical speculations not
   countenanced by orthodox physicians it appeared too that andrews was
   an authority on obscure medicaments; some of the few books i waded
   through revealing that he had spent much time in chemistry and in the
   search for new drugs which might be used as aids in surgery looking
   back at those studies now i find them hellishly suggestive when
   associated with his later experiments

   andrews was gone longer than i expected returning early in november
   almost four months later; and when he did arrive i was quite anxious
   to see him since my condition was at last on the brink of becoming
   noticeable i had reached a point where i must seek absolute privacy to
   keep from being discovered but my anxiety was slight as compared with
   his exuberance over a certain new plan he had hatched while in the
   indies  a plan to be carried out with the aid of a curious drug he had
   learned of from a native doctor in haiti when he explained that his
   idea concerned me i became somewhat alarmed; though in my position
   there could be little to make my plight worse i had indeed
   considered more than once the oblivion that would come with a revolver
   or a plunge from the roof to the jagged rocks below

   on the day after his arrival in the seclusion of the dimly lit study
   he outlined the whole grisly scheme he had found in haiti a drug the
   formula for which he would develop later which induced a state of
   profound sleep in anyone taking it; a trance so deep that death was
   closely counterfeited  with all muscular reflexes even the
   respiration and heartbeat completely stilled for the time being
   andrews had he said seen it demonstrated on natives many times some
   of them remained somnolent for days at a time wholly immobile and as
   much like death as death itself this suspended animation he explained
   further would even pass the closest examination of any medical man he
   himself according to all known laws would have to report as dead a
   man under the influence of such a drug he stated too that the
   subjects body assumed the precise appearance of a corpse  even a
   slight rigor mortis developing in prolonged cases

   for some time his purpose did not seem wholly clear but when the full
   import of his words became apparent i felt weak and nauseated yet in
   another way i was relieved; for the thing meant at least a partial
   escape from my curse an escape from the banishment and shame of an
   ordinary death of the dread leprosy briefly his plan was to
   administer a strong dose of the drug to me and call the local
   authorities who would immediately pronounce me dead and see that i
   was buried within a very short while he felt assured that with their
   careless examination they would fail to notice my leprosy symptoms
   which in truth had hardly appeared only a trifle over fifteen months
   had passed since i had caught the disease whereas the corruption takes
   seven years to run its entire course

   later he said would come resurrection after my interment in the
   family graveyard  beside my centuried dwelling and barely a
   quartermile from his own ancient pile  the appropriate steps would be
   taken finally when my estate was settled and my decease widely known
   he would secretly open the tomb and bring me to his own abode again
   still alive and none the worse for my adventure it seemed a ghastly
   and daring plan but to me it offered the only hope for even a partial
   freedom; so i accepted his proposition but not without a myriad of
   misgivings what if the effect of the drug should wear off while i was
   in my tomb? what if the coroner should discover the awful ruse and
   fail to inter me? these were some of the hideous doubts which assailed
   me before the experiment though death would have been a release from
   my curse i feared it even worse than the yellow scourge; feared it
   even when i could see its black wings constantly hovering over me

   fortunately i was spared the horror of viewing my own funeral and
   burial rites they must however have gone just as andrews had
   planned even to the subsequent disinterment; for after the initial
   dose of the poison from haiti i lapsed into a semiparalytic state and
   from that to a profound nightblack sleep the drug had been
   administered in my room and andrews had told me before giving it that
   he would recommend to the coroner a verdict of heart failure due to
   nerve strain of course there was no embalming  andrews saw to that 
   and the whole procedure leading up to my secret transportation from
   the graveyard to his crumbling manor covered a period of three days
   having been buried late in the afternoon of the third day my body was
   secured by andrews that very night he had replaced the fresh sod just
   as it had been when the workmen left old simes sworn to secrecy had
   helped andrews in his ghoulish task

   later i had lain for over a week in my old familiar bed owing to some
   unexpected effect of the drug my whole body was completely paralyzed
   so that i could move my head only slightly all my senses however
   were fully alert and by another weeks time i was able to take
   nourishment in good quantities andrews explained that my body would
   gradually regain its former sensibilities; though owing to the presence
   of the leprosy it might take considerable time he seemed greatly
   interested in analyzing my daily symptoms and always asked if there
   was any feeling present in my body

   many days passed before i was able to control any part of my anatomy
   and much longer before the paralysis crept from my enfeebled limbs so
   that i could feel the ordinary bodily reactions lying and staring at
   my numb hulk was like having it injected with a perpetual anesthetic
   there was a total alienation i could not understand considering that
   my head and neck were quite alive and in good health

   andrews explained that he had revived my upper half first and could not
   account for the complete bodily paralysis; though my condition seemed
   to trouble him little considering the damnably intent interest he
   centered upon my reactions and stimuli from the very beginning many
   times during lulls in our conversation i would catch a strange gleam in
   his eyes as he viewed me on the couch  a glint of victorious
   exultation which queerly enough he never voiced aloud; though he
   seemed to be quite glad that i had run the gauntlet of death and had
   come through alive still there was that horror i was to meet in less
   than six years which added to my desolation and melancholy during the
   tedious days in which i awaited the return of normal bodily functions
   but i would be up and about he assured me before very long enjoying
   an existence few men had ever experienced the words did not however
   impress me with their true and ghastly meaning until many days later

   during that awful siege in bed andrews and i became somewhat estranged
   he no longer treated me so much like a friend as like an implement in
   his skilled and greedy fingers i found him possessed of unexpected
   traits  little examples of baseness and cruelty apparent even to the
   hardened simes which disturbed me in a most unusual manner often he
   would display extraordinary cruelty to live specimens in his
   laboratory for he was constantly carrying on various hidden projects
   in glandular and muscular transplantation on guineapigs and rabbits
   he had also been employing his newly discovered sleepingpotion in
   curious experiments with suspended animation but of these things he
   told me very little; though old simes often let slip chance comments
   which shed some light on the proceedings i was not certain how much
   the old servant knew but he had surely learned considerable being a
   constant companion to both andrews and myself

   with the passage of time a slow but consistent feeling began creeping
   into my disabled body; and at the reviving symptoms andrews took a
   fanatical interest in my case he still seemed more coldly analytical
   than sympathetic toward me taking my pulse and heartbeat with more
   than usual zeal occasionally in his fevered examinations i saw his
   hands tremble slightly  an uncommon sight with so skilled a surgeon 
   but he seemed oblivious of my scrutiny i was never allowed even a
   momentary glimpse of my full body but with the feeble return of the
   sense of touch i was aware of a bulk and heaviness which at first
   seemed awkward and unfamiliar

   gradually i regained the use of my hands and arms; and with the passing
   of the paralysis came a new and terrible sensation of physical
   estrangement my limbs had difficulty in following the commands of my
   mind and every movement was jerky and uncertain so clumsy were my
   hands that i had to become accustomed to them all over again this
   must i thought be due to my disease and the advance of the contagion
   in my system being unaware of how the early symptoms affected the
   victim (my brothers being a more advanced case) i had no means of
   judging; and since andrews shunned the subject i deemed it better to
   remain silent

   one day i asked andrews  i no longer considered him a friend  if i
   might try rising and sitting up in bed at first he objected
   strenuously but later after cautioning me to keep the blankets well
   up around my chin so that i would not be chilled he permitted it this
   seemed strange in view of the comfortable temperature now that late
   autumn was slowly turning into winter the room was always well heated
   a growing chilliness at night and occasional glimpses of a leaden sky
   through the window had told me of the changing season; for no calendar
   was ever in sight upon the dingy walls with the gentle help of simes i
   was eased to a sitting position andrews coldly watching from the door
   to the laboratory at my success a slow smile spread across his leering
   features and he turned to disappear from the darkened doorway his
   mood did nothing to improve my condition old simes usually so regular
   and consistent was now often late in his duties sometimes leaving me
   alone for hours at a time

   the terrible sense of alienation was heightened by my new position it
   seemed that the legs and arms inside my gown were hardly able to follow
   the summoning of my mind and it became mentally exhausting to continue
   movement for any length of time my fingers woefully clumsy were
   wholly unfamiliar to my inner sense of touch and i wondered vaguely if
   i were to be accursed the rest of my days with an awkwardness induced
   by my dread malady

   it was on the evening following my halfrecovery that the dreams began
   i was tormented not only at night but during the day as well i would
   awaken screaming horribly from some frightful nightmare i dared not
   think about outside the realm of sleep these dreams consisted mainly
   of ghoulish things; graveyards at night stalking corpses and lost
   souls amid a chaos of blinding light and shadow the terrible reality
   of the visions disturbed me most of all: it seemed that some inside
   influence was inducing the grisly vistas of moonlit tombstones and
   endless catacombs of the restless dead i could not place their source;
   and at the end of a week i was quite frantic with abominable thoughts
   which seemed to obtrude themselves upon my unwelcome consciousness

   by that time a slow plan was forming whereby i might escape the living
   hell into which i had been propelled andrews cared less and less about
   me seeming intent only on my progress and growth and recovery of
   normal muscular reactions i was becoming every day more convinced of
   the nefarious doings going on in that laboratory across the threshold 
   the animal cries were shocking and rasped hideously on my overwrought
   nerves and i was gradually beginning to think that andrews had not
   saved me from deportation solely for my own benefit but for some
   accursed reason of his own simess attention was slowly becoming
   slighter and slighter and i was convinced that the aged servitor had a
   hand in the deviltry somewhere andrews no longer eyed me as a friend
   but as an object of experimentation; nor did i like the way he fingered
   his scalpel when he stood in the narrow doorway and stared at me with
   crafty alertness i had never before seen such a transformation come
   over any man his ordinarily handsome features were now lined and
   whiskergrown and his eyes gleamed as if some imp of satan were
   staring from them his cold calculating gaze made me shudder horribly
   and gave me a fresh determination to free myself from his bondage as
   soon as possible

   i had lost track of time during my dreamorgy and had no way of
   knowing how fast the days were passing the curtains were often drawn
   in the daytime the room being lit by waxen cylinders in the large
   candelabrum it was a nightmare of living horror and unreality; though
   through it all i was gradually becoming stronger i always gave careful
   responses to andrews inquiries concerning my returning physical
   control concealing the fact that a new life was vibrating through me
   with every passing day  an altogether strange sort of strength but
   one which i was counting on to serve me in the coming crisis

   finally one chilly evening when the candles had been extinguished and
   a pale shaft of moonlight fell through the dark curtains upon my bed i
   determined to rise and carry out my plan of action there had been no
   movement from either of my captors for several hours and i was
   confident that both were asleep in adjoining bedchambers shifting my
   cumbersome weight carefully i rose to a sitting position and crawled
   cautiously out of bed down upon the floor a vertigo gripped me
   momentarily and a wave of weakness flooded my entire being but
   finally strength returned and by clutching at a bedpost i was able to
   stand upon my feet for the first time in many months gradually a new
   strength coursed through me and i donned the dark robe which i had
   seen hanging on a nearby chair it was quite long but served as a
   cloak over my nightdress again came that feeling of awful
   unfamiliarity which i had experienced in bed; that sense of alienation
   and of difficulty in making my limbs perform as they should but there
   was need for haste before my feeble strength might give out as a last
   precaution in dressing i slipped some old shoes over my feet; but
   though i could have sworn they were my own they seemed abnormally
   loose so that i decided they must belong to the aged simes

   seeing no other heavy objects in the room i seized from the table the
   huge candelabrum upon which the moon shone with a pallid glow and
   proceeded very quietly toward the laboratory door

   my first steps came jerkily and with much difficulty and in the
   semidarkness i was unable to make my way very rapidly when i reached
   the threshold a glance within revealed my former friend seated in a
   large overstuffed chair; while beside him was a smokingstand upon
   which were assorted bottles and a glass he reclined halfway in the
   moonlight through the large window and his greasy features were
   creased in a drunken smirk an opened book lay in his lap  one of the
   hideous tomes from his private library

   for a long moment i gloated over the prospect before me and then
   stepping forward suddenly i brought the heavy weapon down upon his
   unprotected head the dull crunch was followed by a spurt of blood and
   the fiend crumpled to the floor his head laid half open i felt no
   contrition at taking the mans life in such a manner in the hideous
   halfvisible specimens of his surgical wizardry scattered about the
   room in various stages of completion and preservation i felt there was
   enough evidence to blast his soul without my aid andrews had gone too
   far in his practices to continue living and as one of his monstrous
   specimens  of that i was now hideously certain  it was my duty to
   exterminate him simes i realized would be no such easy matter;
   indeed only unusual good fortune had caused me to find andrews
   unconscious when i finally reeled up to the servants bedchamber door
   faint from exhaustion i knew it would take all my remaining strength
   to complete the ordeal

   the old mans room was in utmost darkness being on the north side of
   the structure but he must have seen me silhouetted in the doorway as i
   came in he screamed hoarsely and i aimed the candelabrum at him from
   the threshold it struck something soft making a sloughing sound in
   the darkness; but the screaming continued from that time on events
   became hazy and jumbled together but i remember grappling with the man
   and choking the life from him little by little he gibbered a host of
   awful things before i could lay hands on him  cried and begged for
   mercy from my clutching fingers i hardly realized my own strength in
   that mad moment which left andrews associate in a condition like his
   own

   retreating from the darkened chamber i stumbled for the stairway door
   sagged through it and somehow reached the landing below no lamps were
   burning and my only light was a filtering of moonbeams coming from the
   narrow windows in the hall but i made my jerky way over the cold damp
   slabs of stone reeling from the terrible weakness of my exertion and
   reached the front door after ages of fumbling and crawling about in the
   darkness

   vague memories and haunting shadows came to taunt me in that ancient
   hallway; shadows once friendly and understandable but now grown alien
   and unrecognizable so that i stumbled down the worn steps in a frenzy
   of something more than fear for a moment i stood in the shadow of the
   giant stone manor viewing the moonlit trail down which i must go to
   reach the home of my forefathers only a quarter of a mile distant but
   the way seemed long and for a while i despaired of ever traversing the
   whole of it

   at last i grasped a piece of dead wood as a cane and set out down the
   winding road ahead seemingly only a few rods away in the moonlight
   stood the venerable mansion where my ancestors had lived and died its
   turrets rose spectrally in the shimmering radiance and the black
   shadow cast on the beetling hillside appeared to shift and waver as if
   belonging to a castle of unreal substance there stood the monument of
   half a century; a haven for all my family old and young which i had
   deserted many years ago to live with the fanatical andrews it stood
   empty on that fateful night and i hope that it may always remain so

   in some manner i reached the aged place; though i do not remember the
   last half of the journey at all it was enough to be near the family
   cemetery among whose mosscovered and crumbling stones i would seek
   the oblivion i had desired as i approached the moonlit spot the old
   familiarity  so absent during my abnormal existence  returned to
   plague me in a wholly unexpected way i drew close to my own tombstone
   and the feeling of homecoming grew stronger; with it came a fresh flood
   of that awful sense of alienation and disembodiment which i knew so
   well i was satisfied that the end was drawing near; nor did i stop to
   analyze emotions till a little later when the full horror of my
   position burst upon me

   intuitively i knew my own tombstone; for the grass had scarcely begun
   to grow between the pieces of sod with feverish haste i began clawing
   at the mound and scraping the wet earth from the hole left by the
   removal of the grass and roots how long i worked in the nitrous soil
   before my fingers struck the coffinlid i can never say; but sweat was
   pouring from me and my nails were but useless bleeding hooks

   at last i threw out the last bit of loose earth and with trembling
   fingers tugged on the heavy lid it gave a trifle; and i was prepared
   to lift it completely open when a fetid and nauseous odor assailed my
   nostrils i started erect horrified had some idiot placed my
   tombstone on the wrong grave causing me to unearth another body? for
   surely there could be no mistaking that awful stench gradually a
   hideous uncertainty came over me and i scrambled from the hole one
   look at the newly made headpiece was enough this was indeed my own
   grave   but what fool had buried within it another corpse?

   all at once a bit of the unspeakable truth propelled itself upon my
   brain the odor in spite of its putrescence seemed somehow familiar 
   horribly familiar    yet i could not credit my senses with such an
   idea reeling and cursing i fell into the black cavity once more and
   by the aid of a hastily lit match lifted the long lid completely open
   then the light went out as if extinguished by a malignant hand and i
   clawed my way out of that accursed pit screaming in a frenzy of fear
   and loathing

   when i regained consciousness i was lying before the door of my own
   ancient manor where i must have crawled after that hideous rendezvous
   in the family cemetery i realized that dawn was close at hand and
   rose feebly opening the aged portal before me and entering the place
   which had known no footsteps for over a decade a fever was ravaging my
   weakened body so that i was hardly able to stand but i made my way
   slowly through the musty dimly lit chambers and staggered into my own
   study  the study i had deserted so many years before

   when the sun has risen i shall go to the ancient well beneath the old
   willow tree by the cemetery and cast my deformed self into it no other
   man shall ever view this blasphemy which has survived life longer than
   it should have i do not know what people will say when they see my
   disordered grave but this will not trouble me if i can find oblivion
   from that which i beheld amidst the crumbling mosscrusted stones of
   the hideous place

   i know now why andrews was so secretive in his actions; so damnably
   gloating in his attitude toward me after my artificial death he had
   meant me for a specimen all the time  a specimen of his greatest feat
   of surgery his masterpiece of unclean witchery    an example of
   perverted artistry for him alone to see where andrews obtained that
   other with which i lay accursed in his moldering mansion i shall
   probably never know; but i am afraid that it was brought from haiti
   along with his fiendish medicine at least these long hairy arms and
   horrible short legs are alien to me  alien to all natural and sane
   laws of mankind the thought that i shall be tortured with that other
   during the rest of my brief existence is another hell

   now i can but wish for that which once was mine; that which every man
   blessed of god ought to have at death; that which i saw in that awful
   moment in the ancient burial ground when i raised the lid on the coffin
    my own shrunken decayed and headless body

   8931the doom that came to sarnathh p lovecraft

   there is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no
   stream and out of which no stream flows ten thousand years ago there
   stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath but sarnath stands there
   no more

   it is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young
   before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar another city
   stood beside the lake; the gray stone city of ib which was old as the
   lake itself and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold very odd
   and ugly were these beings as indeed are most beings of a world yet
   inchoate and rudely fashioned it is written on the brick cylinders of
   kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and
   the mists that rise above it; that they had bulging eyes pouting
   flabby lips and curious ears and were without voice it is also
   written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist; they and
   the vast still lake and gray stone city ib however this may be it is
   certain that they worshipped a seagreen stone idol chiseled in the
   likeness of bokrug the great waterlizard; before which they danced
   horribly when the moon was gibbous and it is written in the papyrus of
   ilarnek that they one day discovered fire and thereafter kindled
   flames on many ceremonial occasions but not much is written of these
   beings because they lived in very ancient times and man is young and
   knows but little of the very ancient living things

   after many eons men came to the land of mnar dark shepherd folk with
   their fleecy flocks who built thraa ilarnek and kadatheron on the
   winding river ai and certain tribes more hardy than the rest pushed
   on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious
   metals were found in the earth

   not far from the gray city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first
   stones of sarnath and at the beings of ib they marveled greatly but
   with their marveling was mixed hate for they thought it not meet that
   beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk nor
   did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of ib for
   why those sculptures lingered so late in the world even until the
   coming men none can tell; unless it was because the land of mnar is
   very still and remote from most other lands both of waking and of
   dream

   as the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew
   and it was not less because they found the beings weak and soft as
   jelly to the touch of stones and arrows so one day the young warriors
   the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen marched against ib and
   slew all the inhabitants thereof pushing the queer bodies into the
   lake with long spears because they did not wish to touch them and
   because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of ib they cast
   these also into the lake; wondering from the greatness of the labor how
   ever the stones were brought from afar as they must have been since
   there is naught like them in the land of mnar or in the lands adjacent

   thus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared save the
   seagreen stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug the
   waterlizard this the young warriors took back with them as a symbol
   of conquest over the old gods and beings of ib and as a sign of
   leadership in mnar but on the night after it was set up in the temple
   a terrible thing must have happened for weird lights were seen over
   the lake and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the
   highpriest taranish lying dead as from some fear unspeakable and
   before he died taranish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite
   with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doom

   after taranish there were many highpriests in sarnath but never was
   the seagreen stone idol found and many centuries came and went
   wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly so that only priests and old
   women remembered what taranish had scrawled upon the altar of
   chrysolite betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan
   route and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other
   metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers
   and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along
   the winding river ai and beyond so sarnath waxed mighty and learned
   and beautiful and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the
   neighboring cities; and in time there sat upon a throne in sarnath the
   kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacent

   the wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the
   magnificent of polished desertquarried marble were its walls in
   height three hundred cubits and in breadth seventyfive so that
   chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top for
   full five hundred stadia did they run being open only on the side
   toward the lake where a green stone seawall kept back the waves that
   rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib in
   sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans
   and fifty more intersecting them with onyx were they paved save those
   whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod which were paved with
   granite and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of
   the streets each of bronze and flanked by the figures of lions and
   elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men the houses
   of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony each having its walled
   garden and crystal lakelet with strange art were they builded for no
   other city had houses like them; and travelers from thraa and ilarnek
   and kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were
   surmounted

   but more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples and the
   gardens made by zokkar the olden king there were many palaces the
   last of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron
   so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath
   only the sky; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dother
   their walls showed vast paintings of kings and armies of a splendor at
   once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder many were the pillars of
   the palaces all of tinted marble and carven into designs of
   surpassing beauty and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics
   of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice
   materials so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking
   over beds of the rarest flowers and there were likewise fountains
   which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning
   art outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of
   the lands adjacent on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the
   throne many steps above the gleaming floor and it was wrought of one
   piece of ivory though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece
   could have come in that palace there were also many galleries and
   many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the
   pleasure of the kings sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with
   water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts and then were enacted
   stirring seafights or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine
   things

   lofty and amazing were the seventeen towerlike temples of sarnath
   fashioned of a bright multicolored stone not known elsewhere a full
   thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them wherein the
   highpriests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the
   kings on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the
   palaces; where gathered throngs in worship of zokalar and tamash and
   lobon the chief gods of sarnath whose incenseenveloped shrines were
   as the thrones of monarchs not like the eikons of other gods were
   those of zokalar and tamash and lobon for so close to life were they
   that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the
   ivory thrones and up unending steps of zircon was the towerchamber
   wherefrom the highpriests looked out over the city and the plains and
   the lake by day; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and
   planets and their reflections in the lake at night here was done the
   very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug the
   waterlizard and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the
   doomscrawl of taranish

   wonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king in
   the center of sarnath they lay covering a great space and encircled by
   a high wall and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass
   through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear and
   from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and
   planets when it was not clear in summer the gardens were cooled with
   fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans and in winter they were
   heated with concealed fires so that in those gardens it was always
   spring there ran little streams over bright pebbles dividing meads of
   green and gardens of many hues and spanned by a multitude of bridges
   many were the waterfalls in their courses and many were the hued
   lakelets into which they expanded over the streams and lakelets rode
   white swans whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody
   of the waters in ordered terraces rose the green banks adorned here
   and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms and seats and
   benches of marble and porphyry and there were many small shrines and
   temples where one might rest or pray to small gods

   each year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying
   of ib at which time wine song dancing and merriment of every kind
   abounded great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had
   annihilated the odd ancient beings and the memory of those beings and
   of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with
   roses from the gardens of zokkar and the kings would look out over the
   lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it

   at first the highpriests liked not these festivals for there had
   descended amongst them queer tales of how the seagreen eikon had
   vanished and how taranish had died from fear and left a warning and
   they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath
   the waters of the lake but as many years passed without calamity even
   the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the
   feasters indeed had they not themselves in their high tower often
   performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug
   the waterlizard? and a thousand years of riches and delight passed
   over sarnath wonder of the world

   gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the
   destroying of ib for a decade had it been talked of in the land of
   mnar and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels
   and elephants men from thraa ilarnek and kadetheron and all the
   cities of mnar and the lands beyond before the marble walls on the
   appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of
   travelers within his banquethall reclined nargishei the king
   drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnoth and
   surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves there were eaten
   many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the distant hills
   of linplan heels of camels from the bnazic desert nuts and spices
   from sydathrian groves and pearls from wavewashed mtal dissolved in
   the vinegar of thraa of sauces there were an untold number prepared
   by the subtlest cooks in all mnar and suited to the palate of every
   feaster but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from
   the lake each of vast size and served upon golden platters set with
   rubies and diamonds

   whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace and viewed
   the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters others feasted
   elsewhere in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels
   and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands
   made merry and it was the highpriest gnaikah who first saw the
   shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake and the
   damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to
   shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath
   thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange
   lights on the water and saw that the gray rock akurion which was wont
   to rear high above it near the shore was almost submerged and fear
   grew vaguely yet swiftly so that the princes of ilarnek and of far
   rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed
   though they scarce knew the reason for their departing

   then close to the hour of midnight all the bronze gates of sarnath
   burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the
   plain so that all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in
   fright for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of
   horror unendurable and on their tongues were words so terrible that no
   hearer paused for proof men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked
   aloud of the sight within the kings banquethall where through the
   windows were seen no longer the forms of nargishei and his nobles and
   slaves but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with
   bulging eyes pouting flabby lips and curious ears; things which
   danced horribly bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies
   and diamonds and containing uncouth flames and the princes and
   travelers as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and
   camels and elephants looked again upon the mistbegetting lake and saw
   the gray rock akurion was quite submerged through all the land of mnar
   and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from
   sarnath and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals
   no more it was long ere any travelers went thither and even then only
   the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes who
   are no kin to the men of mnar these men indeed went to the lake to
   view sarnath; but though they found the vast still lake itself and the
   gray rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore they beheld
   not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind where once had
   risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher now
   stretched only the marshy shore and where once had dwelt fifty million
   of men now crawled the detestable waterlizard not even the mines of
   precious metal remained doom had come to sarnath

   but half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol; an
   exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug the great
   waterlizard that idol enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek was
   subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of
   mnar

   was completed in 1927 and was unpublished in his lifetime it is both
   the longest of the stories that comprise his dream cycle and the
   longest of his stories to feature protagonist randolph carter the
   story was published by arkham house in 1943

   three times randolph carter dreamed of the marvelous city and three
   times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace
   above it all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset with walls
   temples colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble silverbasined
   fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens and
   wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossomladen urns and
   ivory statues in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed
   tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of
   grassy cobbles it was a fever of the gods a fanfare of supernal
   trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals mystery hung about it as
   clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as carter stood
   breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to
   him the poignancy and suspense of almostvanished memory the pain of
   lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an
   awesome and momentous place

   he knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in
   what cycle or incarnation he had known it or whether in dream or in
   waking he could not tell vaguely it called up glimpses of a far
   forgotten first youth when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery
   of days and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager
   sound of lutes and song unclosing fiery gates toward further and
   surprising marvels but each night as he stood on that high marble
   terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that
   hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the
   bondage of dreams tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that
   lofty spot or descend the wide marmoreal flights flung endlessly down
   to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning

   when for the third time he awakened with those flights still
   undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed he
   prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood
   capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath in the cold waste where
   no man treads but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting nor
   did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream and
   invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of nasht and
   kamanthah whose caverntemple with its pillar of flame lies not far
   from the gates of the waking world it seemed however that his
   prayers must have been adversely heard for after even the first of
   them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city; as if his three
   glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights and against
   some hidden plan or wish of the gods

   at length sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and
   cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs nor able sleeping or
   waking to drive them from his mind carter resolved to go with bold
   entreaty whither no man had gone before and dare the icy deserts
   through the dark to where unknown kadath veiled in cloud and crowned
   with unimagined stars holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of
   the great ones

   in light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame
   and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and kamanthah
   and the priests shook their pshentbearing heads and vowed it would be
   the death of his soul they pointed out that the great ones had shown
   already their wish and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed
   by insistent pleas they reminded him too that not only had no man
   ever been to kadath but no man had ever suspected in what part of
   space it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world
   or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or
   aldebaran if in our dreamland it might conceivably be reached but
   only three human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed
   the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands and of that three two had
   come back quite mad there were in such voyages incalculable local
   dangers; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers
   unmentionably outside the ordered universe where no dreams reach; that
   last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and
   bubbles at the centre of all infinitythe boundless daemon sultan
   azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud and who gnaws hungrily
   in inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled
   maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of
   accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly
   awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods the blind
   voiceless tenebrous mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is
   the crawling chaos nyarlathotep

   of these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and kamanthah
   in the cavern of flame but still he resolved to find the gods on
   unknown kadath in the cold waste wherever that might be and to win
   from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous
   sunset city he knew that his journey would be strange and long and
   that the great ones would be against it; but being old in the land of
   dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him so
   asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his
   course he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of
   deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted wood

   in the tunnels of that twisted wood whose low prodigious oaks twine
   groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi
   dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of
   the dream world and a few of the waking world since the wood at two
   places touches the lands of men though it would be disastrous to say
   where certain unexplained rumours events and vanishments occur among
   men where the zoogs have access and it is well that they cannot travel
   far outside the world of dreams but over the nearer parts of the dream
   world they pass freely flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing
   back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the
   forest they love most of them live in burrows but some inhabit the
   trunks of the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is
   muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat either physical
   or spiritual for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who
   have not come out carter however had no fear; for he was an old
   dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty
   with them; having found through their help the splendid city of
   celephais in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where reigns half
   the year the great king kuranes a man he had known by another name in
   life kuranes was the one soul who had been to the stargulfs and
   returned free from madness

   threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic
   trunks carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs and
   listened now and then for responses he remembered one particular
   village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood where a circle
   of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and
   more terrible dwellers long forgotten and toward this spot he
   hastened he traced his way by the grotesque fungi which always seem
   better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings
   danced and sacrificed finally the great light of those thicker fungi
   revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof
   of the forest and out of sight this was the nearest of the great ring
   of stones and carter knew he was close to the zoog village renewing
   his fluttering sound he waited patiently; and was at last rewarded by
   an impression of many eyes watching him it was the zoogs for one sees
   their weird eyes long before one can discern their small slippery
   brown outlines

   out they swarmed from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree till the
   whole dimlitten region was alive with them some of the wilder ones
   brushed carter unpleasantly and one even nipped loathsomely at his
   ear; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders
   the council of sages recognizing the visitor offered a gourd of
   fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others which had grown
   from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon; and as carter drank it
   ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began the zoogs did not
   unfortunately know where the peak of kadath lies nor could they even
   say whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another rumours
   of the great ones came equally from all points; and one might only say
   that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in
   valleys since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is
   above and the clouds beneath

   then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheardof by the others;
   and said that in ulthar beyond the river skai there still lingered
   the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by
   waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of
   dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame manytempled olathoe
   and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar those manuscripts he
   said told much of the gods and besides in ulthar there were men who
   had seen the signs of the gods and even one old priest who had scaled
   a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight he had failed
   though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly

   so randolph carter thanked the zoogs who fluttered amicably and gave
   him another gourd of moontree wine to take with him and set out
   through the phosphorescent wood for the other side where the rushing
   skai flows down from the slopes of lerion and hatheg and nir and
   ulthar dot the plain behind him furtive and unseen crept several of
   the curious zoogs; for they wished to learn what might befall him and
   bear back the legend to their people the vast oaks grew thicker as he
   pushed on beyond the village and he looked sharply for a certain spot
   where they would thin somewhat standing quite dead or dying among the
   unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their
   fallen brothers there he would turn sharply aside for at that spot a
   mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor; and those who have
   dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide
   remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks and what it was
   possibly set up for the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab
   with its huge ring; for they realise that all which is forgotten need
   not necessarily be dead and they would not like to see the slab rise
   slowly and deliberately

   carter detoured at the proper place and heard behind him the
   frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs he had known
   they would follow him so he was not disturbed; for one grows
   accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures it was twilight
   when he came to the edge of the wood and the strengthening glow told
   him it was the twilight of morning over fertile plains rolling down to
   the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys and on every hand were
   the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land
   once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water and all the
   dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through
   the grass behind at another house where people were stirring he
   asked questions about the gods and whether they danced often upon
   lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and
   tell him the way to nir and ulthar

   at noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir which he
   had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this
   direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across
   the skai into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human
   sacrifice when they built it thirteenhundred years before once on the
   other side the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs
   at the trailing zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of ulthar; for in
   ulthar according to an ancient and significant law no man may kill a
   cat very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar with their little green
   cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint
   town itself with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories
   and numberless chimneypots and narrow hill streets where one can see
   old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough carter the
   cats being somewhat dispersed by the halfseen zoogs picked his way
   directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and
   old records were said to be; and once within that venerable circular
   tower of ivied stonewhich crowns ulthars highest hillhe sought out
   the patriarch atal who had been up the forbidden peak hathegkla in
   the stony desert and had come down again alive

   atal seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the
   temple was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and
   memory from him carter learned many things about the gods but mainly
   that they are indeed only earths gods ruling feebly our own dreamland
   and having no power or habitation elsewhere they might atal said
   heed a mans prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of
   climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste it was
   lucky that no man knew where kadath towers for the fruits of ascending
   it would be very grave atals companion barzai the wise had been drawn
   screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of
   hathegkia with unknown kadath if ever found matters would be much
   worse; for although earths gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise
   mortal they are protected by the other gods from outside whom it is
   better not to discuss at least twice in the worlds history the other
   gods set their seal upon earths primal granite; once in antediluvian
   times as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic
   manuscripts too ancient to be read and once on hathegkia when barzai
   the wise tried to see earths gods dancing by moonlight so atal said
   it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful
   prayers

   carter though disappointed by atals discouraging advice and by the
   meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven
   cryptical books of hsan did not wholly despair first he questioned
   the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed
   terrace thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods aid;
   but atal could tell him nothing probably atal said the place
   belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general land of
   vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet
   in that case earths gods could not guide him if they would but this
   was not likely since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly
   that it was something the great ones wished to hide from him

   then carter did a wicked thing offering his guileless host so many
   draughts of the moonwine which the zoogs had given him that the old
   man became irresponsibly talkative robbed of his reserve poor atal
   babbled freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported
   by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek on
   the isle of oriab in the southern sea and hinting that it may be a
   likeness which earths gods once wrought of their own features in the
   days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain and he hiccoughed
   likewise that the features of that image are very strange so that one
   might easily recognize them and that they are sure signs of the
   authentic race of the gods

   now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to
   carter it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones
   often espouse the daughters of men so that around the borders of the
   cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their
   blood this being so the way to find that waste must be to see the
   stone face on ngranek and mark the features; then having noted them
   with care to search for such features among living men where they are
   plainest and thickest there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever
   stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that
   wherein stands kadath

   much of the great ones might be learnt in such regions and those with
   their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker they
   might not know their parentage for the gods so dislike to be known
   among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly; a
   thing which carter realized even as he sought to scale kadath but they
   would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows and
   would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the
   dreamland that common folk would call them fools; and from all this one
   could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath or gain hints of the
   marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret and more one might
   in certain cases seize some wellloved child of a god as hostage; or
   even capture some young god himself disguised and dwelling amongst men
   with a comely peasant maiden as his bride

   atal however did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab;
   and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges
   down to the southern sea; where no burgess of ulthar has ever been but
   whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and
   twowheeled carts there is a great city there dylathleen but in
   ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black threebanked galleys
   that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore the traders
   that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human or
   nearly so but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought
   wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from
   unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited

   by the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy and
   carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long
   beard decorously on his chest as he turned to go he observed that no
   suppressed fluttering followed him and wondered why the zoogs had
   become so lax in their curious pursuit then he noticed all the sleek
   complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto and
   recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard in lower
   parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priests conversation he
   recalled too the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent
   young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street
   outside and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black
   kittens he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked
   their chops and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would
   escort him no farther

   it was sunset now so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep
   little street overlooking the lower town and as he went out on the
   balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and
   cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond all mellow and magical in
   the slanted light he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to
   dwell in always were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever
   goading one onward toward unknown perils then twilight fell and the
   pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic and little
   yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows and sweet
   bells pealed in the temple tower above and the first star winked
   softly above the meadows across the skai with the night came song and
   carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the
   filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of simple ulthar and there
   might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthars many cats but
   that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting some of
   them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats
   and which villagers say are on the moons dark side whither the cats
   leap from tall housetops but one small black kitten crept upstairs and
   sprang in carters lap to purr and play and curled up near his feet
   when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed
   with fragrant drowsy herbs

   in the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for
   dylathleen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthars
   busy farms and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the
   smooth road beside the skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little
   quaint fishing towns and on other nights camping under the stars while
   snatches of boatmens songs came from the placid river the country was
   very beautiful with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked
   cottages and octagonal windmills

   on the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead and then
   the tall black towers of dylathleen which is built mostly of basalt
   dylathleen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a
   bit of the giants causeway and its streets are dark and uninviting
   there are many dismal seataverns near the myriad wharves and all the
   town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of
   a few which are said to be not on earth carter questioned the oddly
   robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab
   and found that they knew of it well

   ships came from baharna on that island one being due to return thither
   in only a month and ngranek is but two days zebraride from that
   port but few had seen the stone face of the god because it is on a
   very difficult side of ngranek which overlooks only sheer crags and a
   valley of sinister lava once the gods were angered with men on that
   side and spoke of the matter to the other gods

   it was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in
   dylathleens sea taverns because they mostly preferred to whisper of
   the black galleys one of them was due in a week with rubies from its
   unknown shore and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock the mouths of
   the men who came from it to trade were too wide and the way their
   turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in
   especially bad taste and their shoes were the shortest and queerest
   ever seen in the six kingdoms but worst of all was the matter of the
   unseen rowers those three banks of oars moved too briskly and
   accurately and vigorously to be comfortable and it was not right for a
   ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded yet to give
   no glimpse of its crew it was not fair to the tavernkeepers of
   dylathleen or to the grocers and butchers either; for not a scrap of
   provisions was ever sent aboard the merchants took only gold and stout
   black slaves from parg across the river that was all they ever took
   those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never
   anything from the butchers and grocers but only gold and the fat black
   men of parg whom they bought by the pound and the odours from those
   galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be
   described only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the
   hardiest denizen of the old seataverns bear them dylathleen would
   never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable
   elsewhere but no mine in all earths dreamland was known to produce
   their like

   of these things dylathleens cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst
   carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna which might bear him
   to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren meanwhile
   he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any
   tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a
   marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below
   terraces in the sunset of these things however he learned nothing;
   though he once thought that a certain old slanteyed merchant looked
   queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of this man was
   reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert
   plateau of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are
   seen at night from afar he was even rumoured to have dealt with that
   highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over
   its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery that
   such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as
   may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted but
   carter soon found that it was no use questioning him

   then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and
   the tall lighthouse silent and alien and with a strange stench that
   the south wind drove into the town uneasiness rustled through the
   taverns along that waterfront and after a while the dark widemouthed
   merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore
   to seek the bazaars of the jewellers carter observed them closely and
   disliked them more the longer he looked at them then he saw them drive
   the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into
   that singular galley and wondered in what landsor if in any lands at
   allthose fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve

   and on the third evening of that galleys stay one of the uncomfortable
   merchants spoke to him smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had
   heard in the taverns of carters quest he appeared to have knowledge
   too secret for public telling; and although the sound of his voice was
   unbearably hateful carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller
   must not be overlooked he bade him therefore be his guest in locked
   chambers above and drew out the last of the zoogs moonwine to loosen
   his tongue the strange merchant drank heavily but smirked unchanged
   by the draught then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his
   own and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby
   grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended he
   offered his wine to his host and though carter took only the least
   sip he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined
   jungles all the while the guest had been smiling more and more
   broadly and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was
   that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite
   unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban
   had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth

   carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a
   tentlike awning on the deck of a ship with the marvellous coasts of
   the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness he was not chained
   but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby and the
   sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did
   the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches he saw slip
   past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellowdreamer of
   eartha lighthousekeeper in ancient kingsporthad often discoursed
   in the old days and recognized the templed terraces of zak abode of
   forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous thalarion that daemoncity of
   a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns; the charnel gardens
   of zura land of pleasures unattained and the twin headlands of
   crystal meeting above in a resplendent arch which guard the harbour
   of sonanyl blessed land of fancy

   past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely
   urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below and before
   the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal
   than the basalt pillars of the west beyond which simple folk say
   splendid cathuria lies but which wise dreamers well know are the gates
   of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earths dreamland drop
   wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward
   other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered
   universe where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid
   pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods blind
   voiceless tenebrous and mindless with their soul and messenger
   nyarlathotep

   meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their
   intent though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those
   who wished to hold him from his quest it is understood in the land of
   dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men; and all
   these agents whether wholly human or slightly less than human are
   eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for
   the favour of their hideous soul and messenger the crawling chaos
   nyarlathotep so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped
   turbans hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their
   castle of kadath had decided to take him away and deliver him to
   nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a
   prize what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe
   or in the eldritch spaces outside carter could not guess; nor could he
   imagine at what hellish trystingplace they would meet the crawling
   chaos to give him up and claim their reward he knew however that no
   beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate
   nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central void

   at the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and
   glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some
   hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates then they
   squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat
   that was passed around but when they gave carter a portion he found
   something very terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned
   even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye
   was on him and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath and of
   the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength
   was derived

   it was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the
   west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from
   ahead and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars and
   the deck grew damp and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the
   brink then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken and
   carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great
   boat shot silent and cometlike into planetary space never before had
   he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all
   through the aether leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass
   and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object
   excites their curiosity these are the nameless larvae of the other
   gods and like them are blind and without mind and possessed of
   singular hungers and thirsts

   but that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared for
   he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the
   moon the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they
   approached it and shewing its singular craters and peaks
   uncomfortably the ship made for the edge and it soon became clear
   that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is
   always turned away from earth and which no fully human person save
   perhaps the dreamer snirethko has ever beheld the close aspect of
   the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter and
   he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and
   there the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could
   have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods and in the symmetries of
   the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which
   did not invite solution and what the structure and proportions of the
   olden worshippers could have been carter steadily refused to
   conjecture

   when the ship rounded the edge and sailed over those lands unseen by
   man there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life and
   carter saw many low broad round cottages in fields of grotesque
   whitish fungi he noticed that these cottages had no windows and
   thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux then he
   glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea and knew that the voyage was
   once more to be by wateror at least through some liquid the galley
   struck the surface with a peculiar sound and the odd elastic way the
   waves received it was very perplexing to carter

   they now slid along at great speed once passing and hailing another
   galley of kindred form but generally seeing nothing but that curious
   sea and a sky that was black and starstrewn even though the sun shone
   scorchingly in it

   there presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprouslooking coast
   and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city the way they
   leaned and bent the manner in which they were clustered and the fact
   that they had no windows at all was very disturbing to the prisoner;
   and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious
   wine of that merchant with the humped turban as the coast drew nearer
   and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger he saw upon the
   jagged hills many forests some of whose trees he recognized as akin to
   that solitary moontree in the enchanted wood of earth from whose sap
   the small brown zoogs ferment their curious wine

   carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves
   ahead and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest
   them for they were not men at all or even approximately men but
   great greyishwhite slippery things which could expand and contract at
   will and whose principal shapethough it often changedwas that of a
   sort of toad without any eyes but with a curious vibrating mass of
   short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt vague snout these
   objects were waddling busily about the wharves moving bales and crates
   and boxes with preternatural strength and now and then hopping on or
   off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws and now and
   then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves which indeed
   were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who
   traded in dylathleen; only these herds being without turbans or shoes
   or clothing did not seem so very human after all some of the
   slavesthe fatter ones whom a sort of overseer would pinch
   experimentallywere unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which
   workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering
   vans

   once a van was hitched and driven off and the fabulous thing which
   drew it was such that carter gasped even after having seen the other
   monstrosities of that hateful place now and then a small herd of
   slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven
   aboard a galley followed by a great crew of the slippery toadthings
   as officers navigators and rowers and carter saw that the
   almosthuman creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of
   servitude which required no strength such as steering and cooking
   fetching and carrying and bargaining with men on the earth or other
   planets where they traded these creatures must have been convenient on
   earth for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully
   shod and turbaned and could haggle in the shops of men without
   embarrassment or curious explanations but most of them unless lean or
   illfavoured were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in
   lumbering lorries by fabulous things occasionally other beings were
   unloaded and crated; some very like these semihumans some not so
   similar and some not similar at all and he wondered if any of the
   poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and
   shipped inland in those obnoxious drays

   when the galley landed at a greasylooking quay of spongy rock a
   nightmare horde of toadthings wiggled out of the hatches and two of
   them seized carter and dragged him ashore the smell and aspect of that
   city are beyond telling and carter held only scattered images of the
   tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey
   vertical walls without windows at length he was dragged within a low
   doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness it was
   apparently all one to the toadthings whether it were light or dark
   the odour of the place was intolerable and when carter was locked into
   a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and
   ascertain its form and dimensions it was circular and about twenty
   feet across

   from then on time ceased to exist at intervals food was pushed in but
   carter would not touch it what his fate would be he did not know; but
   he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and
   messenger of infinitys other gods the crawling chaos nyarlathotep
   finally after an unguessed span of hours or days the great stone door
   swung wide again and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into
   the redlitten streets of that fearsome city it was night on the moon
   and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches

   in a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the
   toadthings and twentyfour almost human torchbearers eleven on
   either side and one each before and behind carter was placed in the
   middle of the line; five toadthings ahead and five behind and one
   almosthuman torchbearer on either side of him certain of the
   toadthings produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made
   loathsome sounds to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the
   tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi soon commencing
   to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the
   city that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling
   chaos waited carter could not doubt; and he wished that the suspense
   might soon be over the whining of those impious flutes was shocking
   and he would have given worlds for some even halfnormal sound; but
   these toadthings had no voices and the slaves did not talk

   then through that starspecked darkness there did come a normal sound
   it rolled from the higher hills and from all the jagged peaks around
   it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus it was
   the midnight yell of the cat and carter knew at last that the old
   village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical
   realms which are known only to cats and to which the elders among cats
   repair by stealth nocturnally springing from high housetops verily
   it is to the moons dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the
   hills and converse with ancient shadows and here amidst that column of
   foetid things carter heard their homely friendly cry and thought of
   the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home

   now much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter and in
   this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable but that
   he need not have done for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus
   wax and draw nearer and saw swift shadows against the stars as small
   graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions the call
   of the clan had been given and before the foul procession had time
   even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of
   murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it the flutes
   stopped and there were shrieks in the night dying almosthumans
   screamed and cats spit and yowled and roared but the toadthings made
   never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that
   porous earth with the obscene fungi

   it was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted and carter had
   never before seen so many cats black grey and white; yellow tiger
   and mixed; common persian and manx; thibetan angora and egyptian;
   all were there in the fury of battle and there hovered over them some
   trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess
   great in the temples of bubastis they would leap seven strong at the
   throat of an almosthuman or the pink tentacled snout of a toadthing
   and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain where myriads of their
   fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and
   teeth of a divine battlefury carter had seized a torch from a
   stricken slave but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his
   loyal defenders then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the
   clangour of war and the shouts of the victors and feeling the soft
   paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray

   at last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes and when he opened them
   again it was upon a strange scene the great shining disc of the earth
   thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it had risen
   with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all
   those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one
   endless sea of cats in orderly array circle on circle they reached
   and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and
   purring to him consolingly of the dead slaves and toadthings there
   were not many signs but carter thought he saw one bone a little way
   off in the open space between him and the warriors

   carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats and
   learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and
   often spoken of in the places where cats congregate he had not been
   unmarked in ulthar when he passed through and the sleek old cats had
   remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry
   zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten and they recalled
   too how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at
   the inn and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning
   before he left the grandfather of that very little kitten was the
   leader of the army now assembled for he had seen the evil procession
   from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his
   kind on earth and in the land of dream

   a yowl now came from the farther peak and the old leader paused
   abruptly in his conversation it was one of the armys outposts
   stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which
   earths cats fear; the very large and peculiar cats from saturn who
   for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moons dark
   side they are leagued by treaty with the evil toadthings and are
   notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a
   meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter

   after a brief consultation of generals the cats rose and assumed a
   closer formation crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to
   take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth
   and its dreamland the old fieldmarshal advised carter to let himself
   be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry
   leapers and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land
   gracefully when the rest landed he also offered to deposit him in any
   spot he desired and carter decided on the city of dylathleen whence
   the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for oriab
   and the carven crest ngranek and also to warn the people of the city
   to have no more traffick with black galleys if indeed that traffick
   could be tactfully and judiciously broken off then upon a signal the
   cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their
   midst; while in a black cave on an unhallowed summit of the
   moonmountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotep

   the leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded
   by his companions carter did not see this time the great black
   shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss before
   he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at
   the inn at dylathleen and the stealthy friendly cats were pouring
   out of the window in streams the old leader from ulthar was the last
   to leave and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get
   home by cockcrow when dawn came carter went downstairs and learned
   that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving there was still
   nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab and during
   that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their
   infamous ways most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the
   jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease
   trafficking with the widemouthed merchants if aught of evil ever
   befalls dylathleen through such traffick it will not be his fault

   in about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall
   lighthouse and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of
   wholesome men with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey
   captain in silken robes her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriabs
   inner groves and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna
   and the strange little figures carved from ngraneks ancient lava for
   this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles
   of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in
   parg carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and
   was told that the voyage would take ten days and during his week of
   waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek and was told that
   very few had seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are
   content to learn its legends from old people and lavagatherers and
   imagemakers in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they
   have indeed beheld it the captain was not even sure that any person
   now living had beheld that carven face for the wrong side of ngranek
   is very difficult and barren and sinister and there are rumours of
   caves near the peak wherein dwell the nightgaunts but the captain did
   not wish to say just what a nightgaunt might be like since such
   cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who
   think too often of them then carter asked that captain about unknown
   kadath in the cold waste and the marvellous sunset city but of these
   the good man could truly tell nothing

   carter sailed out of dylathleen one early morning when the tide
   turned and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of
   that dismal basalt town and for two days they sailed eastward in sight
   of green coasts and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed
   up steeply with their red roofs and chimneypots from old dreaming
   wharves and beaches where nets lay drying but on the third day they
   turned sharply south where the roll of water was stronger and soon
   passed from sight of any land on the fifth day the sailors were
   nervous but the captain apologized for their fears saying that the
   ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a
   sunken city too old for memory and that when the water was clear one
   could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk
   disliked it he admitted moreover that many ships had been lost in
   that part of the sea; having been hailed when quite close to it but
   never seen again

   that night the moon was very bright and one could see a great way down
   in the water there was so little wind that the ship could not move
   much and the ocean was very calm looking over the rail carter saw
   many fathoms deep the dome of the great temple and in front of it an
   avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square
   dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins and porpoises
   revelled clumsily here and there sometimes coming to the surface and
   leaping clear out of the sea as the ship drifted on a little the floor
   of the ocean rose in hills and one could clearly mark the lines of
   ancient climbing streets and the washeddown walls of myriad little
   houses

   then the suburbs appeared and finally a great lone building on a hill
   of simpler architecture than the other structures and in much better
   repair it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square with a
   tower at each corner a paved court in the centre and small curious
   round windows all over it probably it was of basalt though weeds
   draped the greater part; and such was its lonely and impressive place
   on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery some
   phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of
   shining and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears
   then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the
   middle of that central court and saw that something was tied to it
   and when after getting a telescope from the captains cabin he saw that
   that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab head downward
   and without any eyes he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the
   ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea

   the next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar in
   the land of forgotten dreams with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for
   cargo and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the
   isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and snowcrowned in the
   distance oriab is a very great isle and its port of baharna a mighty
   city the wharves of baharna are of porphyry and the city rises in
   great stone terraces behind them having streets of steps that are
   frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings
   there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with
   granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath on whose farther
   shore are the vast claybrick ruins of a primal city whose name is not
   remembered as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin
   beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome and in all the million windows
   of baharnas terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as
   the stars peep out overhead in the dusk till that steep and climbing
   seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of
   heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour

   the captain after landing made carter a guest in his own small house
   on the shores of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and
   his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the
   travellers delight and in the days after that carter asked for
   rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places
   where lavagatherers and imagemakers meet but could find no one who
   had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face ngranek was a
   hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it and besides one
   could never depend on the certainty that nightgaunts are altogether
   fabulous

   when the captain sailed back to dylathleen carter took quarters in an
   ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the
   town which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yaths farther
   shore here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek and correlated
   all that he had learned from the lavagatherers about the roads
   thither the keeper of the tavern was a very old man and had heard so
   many legends that he was a great help he even took carter to an upper
   room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a
   traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were
   bolder and less reluctant to visit ngraneks higher slopes the old
   tavernkeepers greatgrandfather had heard from his greatgrandfather
   that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and
   seen the carven face here drawing it for others to behold but carter
   had very great doubts since the large rough features on the wall were
   hasty and careless and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little
   companion shapes in the worst possible taste with horns and wings and
   claws and curling tails

   at last having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the
   taverns and public places of baharna carter hired a zebra and set out
   one morning on the road by yaths shore for those inland parts wherein
   towers stony ngranek on his right were rolling hills and pleasant
   orchards and neat little stone farmhouses and he was much reminded of
   those fertile fields that flank the skai by evening he was near the
   nameless ancient ruins on yaths farther shore and though old
   lavagatherers had warned him not to camp there at night he tethered
   his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his
   blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none
   could decipher around him he wrapped another blanket for the nights
   are cold in oriab; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the
   wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether
   and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin
   groves

   the sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal
   brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and
   pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath and carter
   looked about for his tethered zebra great was his dismay to see that
   docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it
   had been tied and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed
   was quite dead with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound
   in its throat his pack had been disturbed and several shiny
   knickknacks taken away and all round on the dusty soil were great
   webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account the
   legends and warnings of lavagatherers occurred to him and he thought
   of what had brushed his face in the night then he shouldered his pack
   and strode on toward ngranek though not without a shiver when he saw
   close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping
   arch low in the wall of an old temple with steps leading down into
   darkness farther than he could peer

   his course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country and
   he saw only the huts of charcoalburners and the camp of those who
   gathered resin from the groves the whole air was fragrant with balsam
   and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven
   colours in the sun near sunset he came on a new camp of lavagatherers
   returning with laden sacks from ngraneks lower slopes; and here he
   also camped listening to the songs and tales of the men and
   overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost he had
   climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him and at nightfall
   did not return to his fellows when they looked for him the next day
   they found only his turban nor was there any sign on the crags below
   that he had fallen they did not search any more because the old man
   among them said it would be of no use

   no one ever found what the nightgaunts took though those beasts
   themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous carter asked
   them if nightgaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left
   webbed footprints but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed
   frightened at his making such an inquiry when he saw how taciturn they
   had become he asked them no more but went to sleep in his blanket

   the next day he rose with the lavagatherers and exchanged farewells as
   they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them their
   older men gave him blessings and warnings and told him he had better
   not climb too high on ngranek but while he thanked them heartily he
   was in no wise dissuaded for still did he feel that he must find the
   gods on unknown kadath; and win from them a way to that haunting and
   marvellous city in the sunset by noon after a long uphill ride he
   came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hillpeople who had once
   dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava
   here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeepers
   grandfather but about that time they felt that their presence was
   disliked their homes had crept even up the mountains slope and the
   higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose at
   last they decided it would be better to leave altogether since things
   were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret
   favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in
   baharna inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old
   art of imagemaking which to this day they carry on it was from these
   children of the exiled hillpeople that carter had heard the best tales
   about ngranek when searching through baharnas ancient taverns

   all this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and
   higher as carter approached it there were sparse trees on the lower
   slopes and feeble shrubs above them and then the bare hideous rock
   rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow
   carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone and did
   not welcome the prospect of climbing it in places there were solid
   streams of lava and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges
   ninety aeons ago before even the gods had danced upon its pointed
   peak that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of
   the inner thunders now it towered all silent and sinister bearing on
   the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told and there
   were caves in that mountain which might be empty and alone with elder
   darkness or mightif legend spoke trulyhold horrors of a form not
   to be surmised

   the ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek thinly covered with
   scrub oaks and ash trees and strewn with bits of rock lava and
   ancient cinder there were the charred embers of many camps where the
   lavagatherers were wont to stop and several rude altars which they
   had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they
   dreamed of in ngraneks high passes and labyrinthine caves at evening
   carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night
   tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his
   blankets before going to sleep and all through the night a voonith
   howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool but carter felt no
   fear of that amphibious terror since he had been told with certainty
   that not one of them dares even approach the slope of ngranek

   in the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent taking
   his zebra as far as that useful beast could go but tying it to a
   stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep
   thereafter he scrambled up alone; first through the forest with its
   ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings and then over the tough
   grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there he regretted coming
   clear of the trees since the slope was very precipitous and the whole
   thing rather dizzying at length he began to discern all the
   countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked about; the
   deserted huts of the imagemakers the groves of resin trees and the
   camps of those who gathered from them the woods where prismatic magahs
   nest and sing and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and
   of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten he found it
   best not to look around and kept on climbing and climbing till the
   shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough
   grass to cling to

   then the soil became meagre with great patches of bare rock cropping
   out and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice finally there
   was nothing at all but the bare rock and had it not been very rough
   and weathered he could scarcely have ascended farther knobs ledges
   and pinnacles however helped greatly; and it was cheering to see
   occasionally the sign of some lavagatherer scratched clumsily in the
   friable stone and know that wholesome human creatures had been there
   before him after a certain height the presence of man was further
   shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed and by
   little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of
   lava had been found in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped
   artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main
   line of ascent once or twice carter dared to look around and was
   almost stunned by the spread of landscape below all the island betwixt
   him and the coast lay open to his sight with baharnas stone terraces
   and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance and beyond that
   the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secrets

   thus far there had been much winding around the mountain so that the
   farther and carven side was still hidden carter now saw a ledge
   running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished
   and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous
   after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no culdesac but that it led
   steeply on in an arc which would unless suddenly interrupted or
   deflected bring him after a few hours climbing to that unknown
   southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley
   of lava as new country came into view below him he saw that it was
   bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed the
   mountains side too was somewhat different; being here pierced by
   curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left
   some of these were above him and some beneath him all opening on
   sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man
   the air was very cold now but so hard was the climbing that he did not
   mind it only the increasing rarity bothered him and he thought that
   perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and
   excited those absurd tales of nightgaunts whereby they explained the
   loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths he was not
   much impressed by travellers tales but had a good curved scimitar in
   case of any trouble all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see
   that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop
   unknown kadath

   at last in the fearsome iciness of upper space he came round fully to
   the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the
   lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of
   the great ones there was unfolded too a vast expanse of country to
   the south; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage
   chimneys and seemed to have no ending no trace of the sea was visible
   on this side for oriab is a great island black caverns and odd
   crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs but none of
   them was accessible to a climber there now loomed aloft a great
   beetling mass which hampered the upward view and carter was for a
   moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable poised in windy
   insecurity miles above earth with only space and death on one side and
   only slippery walls of rock on the other he knew for a moment the fear
   that makes men shun ngraneks hidden side he could not turn round yet
   the sun was already low if there were no way aloft the night would
   find him crouching there still and the dawn would not find him at all

   but there was a way and he saw it in due season only a very expert
   dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds yet to carter
   they were sufficient surmounting now the outwardhanging rock he
   found the slope above much easier than that below since a great
   glaciers melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges to
   the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown
   depths with a caves dark mouth just out of reach above him
   elsewhere however the mountain slanted back strongly and even gave
   him space to lean and rest

   he felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line and looked
   up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy
   sunlight surely enough there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet
   above and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just
   climbed; hanging there forever in bold outline and when he saw that
   crag he gasped and cried out aloud and clutched at the jagged rock in
   awe; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earths dawn had shaped it
   but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and
   polished features of a god

   stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire how
   vast it was no mind can ever measure but carter knew at once that man
   could never have fashioned it it was a god chiselled by the hands of
   the gods and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker
   rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken and carter saw
   that it was indeed so; for those long narrow eyes and longlobed ears
   and that thin nose and pointed chin all spoke of a race that is not of
   men but of gods

   he clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie even though it was
   this which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a gods
   face more of marvel than prediction can tell and when that face is
   vaster than a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the
   scyptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was
   divinely hewn of old the marvel is so strong that none may escape it

   here too was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had
   planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this
   face might mark them as the gods children he now knew that he need
   not do so certainly the great face carven on that mountain was of no
   strange sort but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns
   of the seaport celephais which lies in oothnargai beyond the tanarian
   hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in
   waking life every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships
   from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold
   and little red singing birds of celephais and it was clear that these
   could be no others than the halfgods he sought where they dwelt
   there must the cold waste lie close and within it unknown kadath and
   its onyx castle for the great ones so to celephais he must go far
   distant from the isle of oriab and in such parts as would take him
   back to dylathteen and up the skai to the bridge by nir and again
   into the enchanted wood of the zoogs whence the way would bend
   northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of
   thran where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenarian sea

   but dusk was now thick and the great carven face looked down even
   sterner in shadow perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in
   the blackness he might neither go down nor go up but only stand and
   cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came praying to
   keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles
   of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley the stars
   came out but save for them there was only black nothingness in his
   eyes; nothingness leagued with death against whose beckoning he might
   do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen
   brink the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor
   soaring close to the westward precipice beside him and darting
   screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out
   of reach

   suddenly without a warning sound in the dark carter felt his curved
   scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand then he
   heard it clatter down over the rocks below and between him and the
   milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something
   noxiously thin and horned and tailed and batwinged other things too
   had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him as if a flock of
   vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that
   inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice then a sort of cold
   rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet and he
   was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space another minute
   and the stars were gone and carter knew that the nightgaunts had got
   him

   they bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through
   monstrous labyrinths beyond when he struggled as at first he did by
   instinct they tickled him with deliberation they made no sound at all
   themselves and even their membranous wings were silent they were
   frightfully cold and damp and slippery and their paws kneaded one
   detestably soon they were plunging hideously downward through
   inconceivable abysses in a whirling giddying sickening rush of dank
   tomblike air; and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate
   vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness he screamed again and again
   but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater
   subtlety then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about and guessed
   they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which
   dim legends tell and which is litten only by the pale deathfire
   wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at
   earths core

   at last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles
   which he knew must be the fabled peaks of throk awful and sinister
   they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths; higher
   than man may reckon and guarding terrible valleys where the dholes
   crawl and burrow nastily but carter preferred to look at them than at
   his captors which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with
   smooth oily whalelike surfaces unpleasant horns that curved inward
   toward each other bat wings whose beating made no sound ugly
   prehensile paws and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and
   disquietingly and worst of all they never spoke or laughed and never
   smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with but only a
   suggestive blankness where a face ought to be all they ever did was
   clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way of nightgaunts

   as the band flew lower the peaks of throk rose grey and towering on all
   sides and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and
   impressive granite of the endless twilight at still lower levels the
   deathfires in the air gave out and one met only the primal blackness
   of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblinlike soon
   the peaks were very far away and nothing about but great rushing winds
   with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them then in the end the
   nightgaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers
   of bones and left carter all alone in that black valley to bring him
   thither was the duty of the nightgaunts that guard ngranek; and this
   done they flapped away silently when carter tried to trace their
   flight he found he could not since even the peaks of throk had faded
   out of sight there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and
   silence and bones

   now carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnoth
   where crawl and burrow the enormous dholes; but he did not know what to
   expect because no one has ever seen a dhole or even guessed what such
   a thing may be like dholes are known only by dim rumour from the
   rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they
   have when they wriggle past one they cannot be seen because they creep
   only in the dark carter did not wish to meet a dhole so listened
   intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him even
   in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective for whispers of
   pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old
   days in brief it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into
   which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their
   feastings; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that
   mighty crag taller even than throks peaks which marks the edge of
   their domain showers of bones would tell him where to look and once
   found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder; for strange to
   say he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures

   a man he had known in bostona painter of strange pictures with a
   secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyardhad
   actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand
   the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering this man
   had vanished at last and carter was not sure but that he might find
   him now and use for the first time in dreamland that faraway english
   of his dim waking life in any case he felt he could persuade a ghoul
   to guide him out of pnoth; and it would be better to meet a ghoul
   which one can see than a dhole which one cannot see

   so carter walked in the dark and ran when he thought he heard
   something among the bones underfoot once he bumped into a stony slope
   and knew it must be the base of one of throks peaks then at last he
   heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air
   and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls he was not
   sure he could be heard from this valley miles below but realised that
   the inner world has strange laws as he pondered he was struck by a
   flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull and therefore
   realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might
   that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul

   sound travels slowly so it was some time before he heard an answering
   glibber but it came at last and before long he was told that a rope
   ladder would be lowered the wait for this was very tense since there
   was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by
   his shouting indeed it was not long before he actually did hear a
   vague rustling afar off as this thoughtfully approached he became
   more and more uncomfortable; for he did not wish to move away from the
   spot where the ladder would come finally the tension grew almost
   unbearable and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of
   something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the
   other sound it was the ladder and after a minute of groping he had it
   taut in his hands but the other sound did not cease and followed him
   even as he climbed he had gone fully five feet from the ground when
   the rattling beneath waxed emphatic and was a good ten feet up when
   something swayed the ladder from below at a height which must have
   been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great
   slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with
   wriggling; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the
   unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed dhole whose form no
   man might see

   for hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands seeing again the
   grey deathfire and throks uncomfortable pinnacles at last he
   discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the
   ghouls whose vertical side he could not glimpse; and hours later he
   saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet
   of notre dame this almost made him lose his hold through faintness
   but a moment later he was himself again; for his vanished friend
   richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul and he knew well
   their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies
   so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him
   out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag and did not
   scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the
   squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously

   he was now on a dimlitten plain whose sole topographical features were
   great boulders and the entrances of burrows the ghouls were in general
   respectful even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others
   eyed his leanness speculatively through patient glibbering he made
   inquiries regarding his vanished friend and found he had become a
   ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world a greenish
   elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickmans present habitation
   so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious
   burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould
   they emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earthold
   gravestones broken urns and grotesque fragments of monumentsand
   carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the
   waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven
   hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumber

   there on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the granary burying ground in
   boston sat a ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman it
   was naked and rubbery and had acquired so much of the ghoulish
   physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure but it still
   remembered a little english and was able to converse with carter in
   grunts and monosyllables helped out now and then by the glibbering of
   ghouls when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood
   and from there to the city celephais in oothnargai beyond the tanarian
   hills it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the waking world
   do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving that to
   the redfooted wamps that are spawned in dead cities) and many things
   intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood including the
   terrible kingdom of the gugs

   the gugs hairy and gigantic once reared stone circles in that wood
   and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos
   nyarlathotep until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears
   of earths gods and they were banished to caverns below only a great
   trap door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the
   earthghouls with the enchanted wood and this the gugs are afraid to
   open because of a curse that a mortal dreamer could traverse their
   cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable; for mortal
   dreamers were their former food and they have legends of the
   toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted
   their diet to the ghasts those repulsive beings which die in the
   light and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs
   like kangaroos

   so the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss
   at sarkomand that deserted city in the valley below leng where black
   nitrous stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from
   dreamland to the lower gulfs or to return through a churchyard to the
   waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light
   slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate
   of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood this however did not suit
   the seeker; for he knew nothing of the way from leng to oothnargai
   and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far
   gained in this dream it was disastrous to his quest to forget the
   august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded
   onyx in celephais and who being the sons of gods must point the way
   to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwell

   after much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the
   great wall of the gugs kingdom there was one chance that carter might
   be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers
   at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors and
   reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it which has the
   stairs leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood
   pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone
   lever in raising the stone door; for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat
   afraid and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when
   they see them feasting there

   he also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the
   beard he had allowed to grow (for ghouls have none) wallowing naked in
   the mould to get the correct surface and loping in the usual slumping
   way with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice
   morsel from a tomb they would reach the city of gugswhich is
   coterminous with the whole kingdomthrough the proper burrows
   emerging in a cemetery not far from the staircontaining tower of koth
   they must beware however of a large cave near the cemetery; for this
   is the mouth of the vaults of zin and the vindictive ghasts are always
   on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who
   hunt and prey on them the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep
   and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs for they cannot
   discriminate they are very primitive and eat one another the gugs
   have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of zin but he is often drowsy
   and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts though ghasts cannot
   live in real light they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for
   hours

   so at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful
   ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of col nepemiah derby obit 1719
   from the charter street burying ground in salem when they came again
   into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths
   reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest
   gravestones of the gugs on the right of the hole out of which they
   wriggled and seen through aisles of monoliths was a stupendous vista
   of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of
   inner earth this was the great city of the gugs whose doorways are
   thirty feet high ghouls come here often for a buried gug will feed a
   community for almost a year and even with the added peril it is better
   to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men carter now
   understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the
   vale of pnoth

   straight ahead and just outside the cemetery rose a sheer
   perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern
   yawned this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible since
   it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt
   ghasts in the darkness and truly that warning was soon well
   justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to
   see if the hour of the gugs resting had been rightly timed there
   glowed in the gloom of that great caverns mouth first one pair of
   yellowishred eyes and then another implying that the gugs were one
   sentry less and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of
   smell so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions
   to be silent it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices and
   there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw since they must
   naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black
   vaults after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped
   out into the grey twilight and carter turned sick at the aspect of
   that scabrous and unwholesome beast whose face is so curiously human
   despite the absence of a nose a forehead and other important
   particulars

   presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow and a
   ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of battlescars was
   a bad sign it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all
   but had merely slipped past him as he slept so that their strength and
   savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found
   and disposed of a victim it was very unpleasant to see those filthy
   and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen grubbing
   about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan
   towers and monoliths arose but it was still more unpleasant when they
   spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts and yet
   horrible as they were they were not so horrible as what presently came
   out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness

   it was a paw fully two feet and a half across and equipped with
   formidable talons alter it came another paw and after that a great
   blackfurred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short
   forearms then two pink eyes shone and the head of the awakened gug
   sentry large as a barrel wabbled into view the eyes jutted two
   inches from each side shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with
   coarse hairs but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth
   that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of
   the head opening vertically instead of horizontally

   but before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to
   his full twenty feet the vindictive ghasts were upon him carter
   feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin
   till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means
   of facial expression the battle which then ensued was truly a
   frightful one from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at
   the creeping gug nipping and tearing with their muzzles and mauling
   murderously with their hard pointed hooves all the time they coughed
   excitedly screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would
   occasionally bite into one of their number so that the noise of the
   combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the
   weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and
   farther within the cavern as it was the tumult soon receded
   altogether from sight in the blackness with only occasional evil
   echoes to mark its continuance

   then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance
   and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and
   into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers
   of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight silently they shambled
   over that rough rock pavement hearing with disgust the abominable
   muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of
   the gugs apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour the ghouls set a
   somewhat rapid pace; but even so the journey was no brief one for
   distances in that town of giants are on a great scale at last
   however they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster
   than the rest; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous
   symbol in basrelief which made one shudder without knowing its
   meaning this was the central tower with the sign of koth and those
   huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the
   beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the
   enchanted wood

   there now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness: made
   almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps which were
   fashioned for gugs and were therefore nearly a yard high of their
   number carter could form no just estimate for he soon became so worn
   out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him all
   through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and
   pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest
   because of the great ones curse there are no such restraints
   concerning the tower and the steps and escaped ghasts are often
   chased even to the very top so sharp are the ears of gugs that the
   bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the
   city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the
   striding giants accustomed from their ghasthunts in the vaults of zin
   to seeing without light to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on
   those cyclopean steps it was very depressing to reflect that the
   silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all but would come very
   suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers nor could the
   traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar
   place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs there was also
   some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts which frequently
   hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs if the gugs
   slept long and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern
   the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome
   and illdisposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be
   eaten by a gug

   then after aeons of climbing there came a cough from the darkness
   above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn

   it was clear that a ghast or perhaps even more had strayed into that
   tower before the coming of carter and his guides; and it was equally
   clear that this peril was very close alter a breathless second the
   leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the
   best possible way with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing
   blow whenever the enemy might come in sight ghouls can see in the
   dark so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been
   alone in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward
   hopping of at least one beast and the slabbearing ghouls poised their
   weapon for a desperate blow presently two yellowishred eyes flashed
   into view and the panting of the ghast became audible above its
   clattering as it hopped down to the step above the ghouls they
   wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force so that there was
   only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious
   heap there seemed to be only this one animal and after a moment of
   listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again as
   before they were obliged to aid him; and he was glad to leave that
   place of carnage where the ghasts uncouth remains sprawled invisible
   in the blackness

   at last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above
   him carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at
   last to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of but
   the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under
   as a prop and permit carter to escape through the crack they
   themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the
   gugs since their elusiveness was great and they did not know the way
   overland to spectral sarkomand with its lionguarded gate to the abyss

   mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door
   above them and carter helped push with as much strength as he had
   they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one
   and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished
   muscles alter a few moments a crack of light appeared; and carter to
   whom that task had been entrusted slipped the end of the old
   gravestone in the aperture there now ensued a mighty heaving; but
   progress was very slow and they had of course to return to their first
   position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal
   open

   suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on
   the steps below them it was only the thumping and rattling of the
   slain ghasts hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all
   the possible causes of that bodys dislodgement and rolling none was
   in the least reassuring therefore knowing the ways of gugs the
   ghouls set to with something of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short
   time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst
   carter turned the slab and left a generous opening they now helped
   carter through letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and
   later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper
   dreamland outside another second and they were through themselves
   knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap door while a
   panting became audible beneath because of the great ones curse no gug
   might ever emerge from that portal so with a deep relief and sense of
   repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted
   wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest

   weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long
   ago it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now
   left behind there was no living denizen about for zoogs shun the
   mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls
   about their future course to return through the tower they no longer
   dared and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned
   that they must pass the priests nasht and kamanthah in the cavern of
   flame so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its
   gate of the abyss though of how to get there they knew nothing carter
   recalled that it lies in the valley below leng and recalled likewise
   that he had seen in dylathleen a sinister slanteyed old merchant
   reputed to trade on leng therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out
   dylathleen crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the
   river to its mouth this they at once resolved to do and lost no time
   in loping off since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night
   ahead for travel and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts
   thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast
   which once was pickman; but could not help sighing with pleasure when
   they left for a ghoul is a ghoul and at best an unpleasant companion
   for man after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of
   the mud of nether earth thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so
   carefully carried

   it was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees but
   because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day;
   wherefore carter set out upon the wellknown route toward celephais in
   oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills and as he went he thought of the
   zebra he had left tethered to an ashtree on ngranek in faraway oriab
   so many aeons ago and wondered if any lavagatherers had fed and
   released it and he wondered too if he would ever return to baharna
   and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by
   yaths shore and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him such were
   the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper
   dreamland

   but presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large
   hollow tree he had avoided the great circle of stones since he did
   not care to speak with zoogs just now; but it appeared from the
   singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in
   session elsewhere upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a
   tense and heated discussion; and before long became conscious of
   matters which he viewed with the greatest concern for a war on the
   cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs it all came
   from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar
   and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions the
   matter had long rankled; and now or at least within a month the
   marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a
   series of surprise attacks taking individual cats or groups of cats
   unawares and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance
   to drill and mobilise this was the plan of the zoogs and carter saw
   that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest

   very quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the
   wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields and a great
   grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across
   leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small black grey
   tiger white yellow and mixed and it echoed through nir and beyond
   the skai even into ulthar and ulthars numerous cats called in chorus
   and fell into a line of march it was fortunate that the moon was not
   up so that all the cats were on earth swiftly and silently leaping
   they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry
   sea across the plains to the edge of the wood carter was there to
   greet them and the sight of shapely wholesome cats was indeed good
   for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss
   he was glad to see his venerable friend and onetime rescuer at the
   head of ulthars detachment a collar of rank around his sleek neck
   and whiskers bristling at a martial angle better still as a
   sublieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be
   none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had
   given a saucer of rich cream on that longvanished morning in ulthar
   he was a strapping and promising cat now and purred as he shook hands
   with his friend his grandfather said he was doing very well in the
   army and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more
   campaign

   carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe and was rewarded by
   deepthroated purrs of gratitude from all sides consulting with the
   generals he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching
   at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs;
   forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before
   the mobilization of their army of invasion thereupon without a
   moments loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and
   surged around the council tree and the great stone circle flutterings
   rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very
   little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs they saw
   that they were beaten in advance and turned from thoughts of vengeance
   to thoughts of present selfpreservation

   half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the
   captured zoogs in the centre leaving open a lane down which were
   marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other
   parts of the wood terms were discussed at length carter acting as
   interpreter and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free
   tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse
   quail and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the forest twelve
   young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the
   temple of cats at ulthar and the victors made it plain that any
   disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be
   followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs these matters
   disposed of the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to
   slink off one by one to their respective homes which they hastened to
   do with many a sullen backward glance

   the old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to
   whatever border he wished to reach deeming it likely that the zoogs
   would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their
   warlike enterprise this offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for
   the safety it afforded but because he liked the graceful companionship
   of cats so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment relaxed
   after the successful performance of its duty randolph carter walked
   with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan
   trees talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson
   whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased
   fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of that primeval
   floor and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in
   the cold waste but did not know where it was as for the marvellous
   sunset city he had not even heard of that but would gladly relay to
   carter anything he might later learn

   he gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of
   dreamland and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in
   celephais whither he was bound that old cat already slightly known
   to carter was a dignified maltese; and would prove highly influential
   in any transaction it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of
   the wood and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell the young
   sublieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had
   not the old general forbidden it but that austere patriarch insisted
   that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army so carter set
   out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a
   willowfringed river and the cats went back into the wood

   well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the
   wood of the cerenerian sea and blithely did he follow the singing
   river oukianos that marked his course the sun rose higher over gentle
   slopes of grove and lawn and heightened the colours of the thousand
   flowers that starred each knoll and dangle a blessed haze lies upon
   all this region wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than
   other places hold and a little more of the summers humming music of
   birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place
   and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember

   by noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to
   the rivers edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of
   ilekvad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a
   golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukianos who sang to him in
   youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks all of jasper is that
   temple and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts its
   seven pinnacled towers and its inner shrine where the river enters
   through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night many
   times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and
   terraces and pinnacles but whether that music be the song of the god
   or the chant of the cryptical priests none but the king of ilekvad
   may say; for only he had entered the temple or seen the priests now
   in the drowsiness of day that carven and delicate fane was silent and
   carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the
   birds and bees as he walked onward under the enchanted sun

   all that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and
   in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages
   and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl
   sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukianos and whistled to the
   sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream and at other
   times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great
   dark wood on the farther side whose trees came down clear to the
   waters edge in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths
   come shyly out of that wood to drink but now he could not glimpse any
   once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing
   bird which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the
   sun and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged
   hunter sought to dart down upon it

   toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming
   in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran lofty beyond belief
   are the alabaster walls of that incredible city sloping inward toward
   the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows for
   they are more ancient than memory yet lofty as they are with their
   hundred gates and two hundred turrets the clustered towers within all
   white beneath their golden spires are loftier still; so that men on
   the plain around see them soaring into the sky sometimes shining
   clear sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist and
   sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free
   above the vapours and where thrans gates open on the river are great
   wharves of marble with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and
   calamander riding gently at anchor and strange bearded sailors sitting
   on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places landward beyond
   the walls lies the farm country where small white cottages dream
   between little hills and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind
   gracefully among streams and gardens

   down through this verdant land carter walked at evening and saw
   twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of
   thran and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate and
   was stopped by a redrobed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond
   belief and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thrans steep
   mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars where the wares of the
   ornate galleons were sold then into that incredible city he walked;
   through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel and thereafter
   amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the
   heavenward towers lights shone through grated and balconied windows
   andthe sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where
   marble fountains bubbled carter knew his way and edged down through
   darker streets to the river where at an old sea tavern he found the
   captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams there he
   bought his passage to celephais on a great green galleon and there he
   stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of
   that inn who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of
   old wars and forgotten gods

   in the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephais and sat
   in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the
   cerenerian sea begun for many leagues the banks were much as they were
   above thran with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther
   hills toward the right and a drowsy village on the shore with steep
   red roofs and nets spread in the sun mindful of his search carter
   questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in
   the taverns of celephais asking the names and ways of the strange men
   with long narrow eyes longlobed ears thin noses and pointed chins
   who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved
   jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais of these
   men the sailors knew not much save that they talked but seldom and
   spread a kind of awe about them

   their land very far away was called inquanok and not many people
   cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land and said to be
   close to unpleasant leng; although high impassable mountains towered on
   the side where leng was thought to lie so that none might say whether
   this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable
   monastery were really there or whether the rumour were only a fear
   that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks
   loomed black against a rising moon certainly men reached leng from
   very different oceans of other boundaries of inquanok those sailors
   had no notion nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath
   save from vague unplaced report and of the marvellous sunset city
   which carter sought they knew nothing at all so the traveller asked no
   more of far things but bided his time till he might talk with those
   strange men from cold and twilight inquanok who are the seed of such
   gods as carved their features on ngranek

   late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which
   traverse the perfumed jungles of kied here carter wished he might
   disembark for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory
   lone and unbroken where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose
   name is forgotten spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed
   and undecayed for it is written that there may one day be need of them
   again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight
   though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to
   which their wholeness is due but the ship swept on and dusk hushed
   the hum of the day and the first stars above blinked answers to the
   early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind leaving
   only its fragrance as a memory that it had been and all through the
   night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected
   once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east but the sleepy
   captain said they had better not be looked at too much since it was
   highly uncertain just who or what had lit them

   in the morning the river had broadened out greatly and carter saw by
   the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading
   city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea here the walls are of rugged
   granite and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered
   gables the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than
   any others in dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for
   barter but is prized for the solid work of its artisans the wharves
   of hlanith are of oak and there the galleon made fast while the
   captain traded in the taverns carter also went ashore and looked
   curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and
   feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars the sea
   taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the
   spray of high tides and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low
   blackbeamed ceilings and casements of greenish bullseye panes
   ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports and told
   many stories of the curious men from twilight inquanok but had little
   to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told then at last after
   much unloading and loading the ship set sail once more over the sunset
   sea and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last
   golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men
   had given them

   two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea
   sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel then near sunset of
   the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its
   gingkotrees swaying on the lower slope and carter knew that they were
   come to the land of oothnargai and the marvellous city of celephais
   swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous
   town and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues and
   the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea then rose the gentle
   hills behind the town with their groves and gardens of asphodels and
   the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the
   purple ridge of the tanarians potent and mystical behind which lay
   forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream

   the harbour was full of painted galleys some of which were from the
   marble cloudcity of serannian that lies in ethereal space beyond
   where the sea meets the sky and some of which were from more
   substantial parts of dreamland among these the steersman threaded his
   way up to the spicefragrant wharves where the galleon made fast in
   the dusk as the citys million lights began to twinkle out over the
   water ever new seemed this deathless city of vision for here time has
   no power to tarnish or destroy as it has always been is still the
   turquoise of nathhorthath and the eighty orchidwreathed priests are
   the same who builded it ten thousand years ago shining still is the
   bronze of the great gates nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or
   broken and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on
   merchants and camel drivers older than fable yet without one grey hair
   in their forked beards

   carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel
   but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors and when it
   was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he
   knew well and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he
   sought the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the
   strange mariners of inquanok but was told that none were now in port
   their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks he found
   however one thorabonian sailor who had been to inquanok and had worked
   in the onyx quarries of that twilight place; and this sailor said there
   was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region which
   everybody seemed to fear and shun the thorabonian opined that this
   desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into lengs
   horrible plateau and that this was why men feared it; though he
   admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless
   sentinels whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein
   unknown kadath stands he did not know; but it seemed unlikely that
   those presences and sentinels if indeed they existed were stationed
   for nought

   on the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the
   turquoise temple and talked with the highpriest though nathhorthath
   is chiefly worshipped in celephais all the great ones are mentioned in
   diurnal prayers; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods
   like atal in distant ulthar he strongly advised against any attempts
   to see them; declaring that they are testy and capricious and subject
   to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside whose
   soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep their jealous
   hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not
   wish carter to reach it and it was doubtful how they would regard a
   guest whose object was to see them and plead before them no man had
   ever found kadath in the past and it might be just as well if none
   ever found it in the future such rumours as were told about that onyx
   castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuring

   having thanked the orchidcrowned highpriest carter left the temple
   and sought out the bazaar of the sheepbutchers where the old chief of
   celephais cats dwelt sleek and contented that grey and dignified
   being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement and extended a languid
   paw as his caller approached but when carter repeated the passwords
   and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar the
   furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative; and told much of
   the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of oothnargai
   best of all he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid
   waterfront cats of celephais about the men of inquanok on whose dark
   ships no cat will go

   it seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them though
   that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships the reason
   for this is that inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure so
   that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or
   a homely mew whether it be because of things wafted over the
   impassable peaks from hypothetical leng or because of things filtering
   down from the chilly desert to the north none may say; but it remains
   a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which
   cats do not like and to which they are more sensitive than men
   therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays
   of inquanok

   the old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king
   kuranes who in carters latter dreams had reigned alternately in the
   rosecrystal palace of the seventy delights at celephais and in the
   turreted cloudcastle of skyfloating serannian it seemed that he
   could no more find content in those places but had formed a mighty
   longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood; where in
   little dreaming villages englands old songs hover at evening behind
   lattice windows and where grey church towers peep lovely through the
   verdure of distant valleys he could not go back to these things in the
   waking world because his body was dead; but he had done the next best
   thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east
   of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the seacliffs to the
   foot of the tanarian hills there he dwelt in a grey gothic manorhouse
   of stone looking on the sea and tried to think it was ancient trevor
   towers where he was born and where thirteen generations of his
   forefathers had first seen the light and on the coast nearby he had
   built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways
   settling therein such people as had the most english faces and seeking
   ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers
   and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose
   tower he could see from his window placing around it in the churchyard
   grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon and with a
   moss somewhat like old englands moss for though kuranes was a monarch
   in the land of dream with all imagined pomps and marvels splendours
   and beauties ecstasies and delights novelties and excitements at his
   command he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power
   and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure
   and quiet england that ancient beloved england which had moulded his
   being and of which he must always be immutably a part

   so when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu he did not
   seek the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern
   gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he
   glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the seacliffs and
   in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge
   and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and
   annointed lackey of the palace but a small stubby old man in a smock
   who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall and
   carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to
   englands trees and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in
   queen annes time at the door flanked by stone cats in the old way
   he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery; and was presently
   taken to the library where kuranes lord of oothnargai and the sky
   around serannian sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his
   little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in
   and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawnparty at
   the vicars with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of
   patience

   kuranes clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by london tailors
   in his youth rose eagerly to meet his guest; for the sight of an
   anglosaxon from the waking world was very dear to him even if it was
   a saxon from boston massachusetts instead of from cornwall and for
   long they talked of old times having much to say because both were old
   dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places kuranes
   indeed had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void and was
   said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyage

   at length carter brought up the subject of his quest and asked of his
   host those questions he had asked of so many others kuranes did not
   know where kadath was or the marvellous sunset city; but he did know
   that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out and that
   the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent
   curiosity he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of
   space especially in that region where form does not exist and
   coloured gases study the innermost secrets the violet gas sngac had
   told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep and had
   warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan
   azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark

   altogether it was not well to meddle with the elder ones; and if they
   persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city it were
   better not to seek that city

   kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by
   coming to the city even were he to gain it he himself had dreamed and
   yearned long years for lovely celephais and the land of oothnargai
   and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of
   its chains and conventions and stupidities but now that he was come
   into that city and that land and was the king thereof he found the
   freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out and monotonous for
   want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories he was
   a king in oothnargai but found no meaning therein and drooped always
   for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth all
   his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over
   the downs and all the thousand minarets of celephais for the steep
   homely roofs of the village near his home so he told his guest that
   the unknown sunset city might not hold quite that content he sought
   and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and halfremembered
   dream for he had visited carter often in the old waking days and knew
   well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birth

   at the last he was very certain the seeker would long only for the
   early remembered scenes; the glow of beacon hill at evening the tall
   steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport the hoary
   gambrel roofs of ancient and witchhaunted arkham and the blessed
   meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables
   peeped out from bowers of verdure these things he told randolph
   carter but still the seeker held to his purpose and in the end they
   parted each with his own conviction and carter went back through the
   bronze gate into celephais and down the street of pillars to the old
   sea wall where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and
   waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inquanok whose
   strangefaced sailors and onyxtraders had in them the blood of the
   great ones

   one starlit evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the
   longedfor ship put in and strangefaced sailors and traders appeared
   one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea
   wall it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the
   godlike features of ngranek but carter did not hasten to speak with
   the silent seamen he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and
   dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones and
   was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too
   closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land
   they talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns;
   but would gather in groups in remote comers and sing among themselves
   the haunting airs of unknown places or chant long tales to one another
   in accents alien to the rest of dreamland and so rare and moving were
   those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces
   of those who listened even though the words came to common ears only
   as strange cadence and obscure melody

   for a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the
   bazaars of celephais and before they sailed carter had taken passage
   on their dark ship telling them that he was an old onyx miner and
   wishful to work in their quarries that ship was very lovey and
   cunningly wrought being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries
   of gold and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of
   silk and velvet one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were
   raised and the anchor lilted and as carter stood on the high stern he
   saw the sunriseblazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of
   ageless celephais sink into the distance and the snowy peak of mount
   man grow smaller and smaller by noon there was nothing in sight save
   the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea with one painted galley afar off
   bound for that realm of serannian where the sea meets the sky

   and the night came with gorgeous stars and the dark ship steered for
   charles wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole
   and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places and they stole
   off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured
   old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish
   playing in bowers beneath the sea carter went to sleep at midnight
   and rose in the glow of a young morning marking that the sun seemed
   farther south than was its wont and all through that second day he
   made progress in knowing the men of the ship getting them little by
   little to talk of their cold twilight land of their exquisite onyx
   city and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which
   leng was said to be they told him how sorry they were that no cats
   would stay in the land of inquanok and how they thought the hidden
   nearness of leng was to blame for it only of the stony desert to the
   north they would not talk there was something disquieting about that
   desert and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence

   on later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was
   going to work there were many of them for all the city of inquanok
   was builded of onyx whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in
   rinar ogrothan and celephais and at home with the merchants of thraa
   flarnek and kadatheron for the beautiful wares of those fabulous
   ports and far to the north almost in the cold desert whose existence
   the men of inquanok did not care to admit there was an unused quarry
   greater than all the rest; from which had been hewn in forgotten times
   such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled
   vacancies struck terror to all who beheld who had mined those
   incredible blocks and whither they had been transported no man might
   say; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry around which
   such inhuman memories might conceivably cling so it was left all alone
   in the twilight with only the raven and the rumoured shantakbird to
   brood on its immensities when carter heard of this quarry he was moved
   to deep thought for he knew from old tales that the great ones castle
   atop unknown kadath is of onyx

   each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky and the mists
   overhead grew thicker and thicker and in two weeks there was not any
   sunlight at all but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome
   of eternal cloud by day and a cold starless phosphorescence from the
   under side of that cloud by night on the twentieth day a great jagged
   rock in the sea was sighted from afar the first land glimpsed since
   mans snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship carter asked the captain
   the name of that rock but was told that it had no name and had never
   been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at
   night and when after dark a dull and ceaseless howling arose from
   that jagged granite place the traveller was glad that no stop had been
   made and that the rock had no name the seamen prayed and chanted till
   the noise was out of earshot and carter dreamed terrible dreams within
   dreams in the small hours

   two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line
   of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of
   that twilight world and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad
   songs and some knelt down on the deck to pray so that carter knew
   they were come to the land of inquanok and would soon be moored to the
   basalt quays of the great town bearing that lands name toward noon a
   dark coastline appeared and before three oclock there stood out
   against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx
   city rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and
   quays all of delicate black with scrolls flutings and arabesques of
   inlaid gold tall and manywindowed were the houses and carved on
   every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the
   eye with a beauty more poignant than light some ended in swelling
   domes that tapered to a point others in terraced pyramids whereon rose
   clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and
   imagination the walls were low and pierced by frequent gates each
   under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by
   the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the
   monstrous face on distant ngranek on a hill in the centre rose a
   sixteenangled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high
   pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome this the seamen said
   was the temple of the elder ones and was ruled by an old highpriest
   sad with inner secrets

   at intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city
   answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns viols
   and chanting voices and from a row of tripods on a galley round the
   high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments;
   for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal
   mysteries and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set
   forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts as the ship rode
   past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of
   the city grew manifest and carter saw the slaves sailors and
   merchants on the docks the sailors and merchants were of the
   strangefaced race of the gods but the slaves were squat slanteyed
   folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the
   impassable peaks from the valleys beyond leng the wharves reached wide
   outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from
   the galleys anchored there while at one end were great piles of onyx
   both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar
   ograthan and celephais

   it was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting
   quay of stone and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through
   the arched gate into the city the streets of that city were paved with
   onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked
   and narrow the houses near the water were lower than the rest and
   bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said
   to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each the
   captain of the ship took carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the
   mariners of quaint countries and promised that he would next day shew
   him the wonders of the twilight city and lead him to the taverns of
   the onyxminers by the northern wall and evening fell and little
   bronze lamps were lighted and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of
   remote places but when from its high tower the great bell shivered
   over the city and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose
   cryptical in answer thereto all ceased their songs or tales and bowed
   silent till the last echo died away for there is a wonder and a
   strangeness on the twilight city of inquanok and men fear to be lax in
   its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close

   far in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not
   like for it was unmistakably that of the old slanteyed merchant he
   had seen so long before in the taverns of dylathleen who was reputed
   to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk
   visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar and even to
   have dealt with that highpriest not to be described which wears a
   yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric
   stone monastery this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing
   when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and
   kadath; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inquanok so close
   to the wonders of the north was not a reassuring thing he slipped
   wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him and sailors later
   said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well
   determined bearing the colossal and richflavoured eggs of the
   rumoured shantakbird to trade for the dextrous jade goblets that
   merchants brought from ilarnek

   on the following morning the shipcaptain led carter through the onyx
   streets of inquanok dark under their twilight sky the inlaid doors
   and figured housefronts carven balconies and crystalpaned oriels all
   gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness; and now and then a plaza
   would open out with black pillars colonnades and the statues of
   curious beings both human and fabulous some of the vistas down long
   and unbending streets or through side alleys and over bulbous domes
   spires and arabesqued roofs were weird and beautiful beyond words;
   and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great
   central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides its
   flattened dome and its lofty pinnacled belfry overtopping all else
   and majestic whatever its foreground and always to the east far
   beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land rose the gaunt
   grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous
   leng was said to lie

   the captain took carter to the mighty temple which is set with its
   walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes
   from a wheels hub the seven arched gates of that garden each having
   over it a carven face like those on the citys gates are always open
   and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through
   the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest
   gods and there are fountains pools and basins there to reflect the
   frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony all of onyx and
   having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower
   bowers of ocean when the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers
   over the garden and the city and the answer of the horns and viols and
   voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates there issue
   from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded
   priests in black bearing at arms length before them great golden
   bowls from which a curious steam rises and all the seven columns strut
   peculiarly in single file legs thrown far forward without bending the
   knees down the walks that lead to the seven lodges wherein they
   disappear and do not appear again it is said that subterrene paths
   connect the lodges with the temple and that the long files of priests
   return through them; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx
   steps go down to mysteries that are never told but only a few are
   those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are
   not human beings

   carter did not enter the temple because none but the veiled king is
   permitted to do that but before he left the garden the hour of the
   bell came and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him and
   the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by
   the gates and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of
   bowlbearing priests in their singular way giving to the traveller a
   fear which human priests do not often give when the last of them had
   vanished he left that garden noting as he did so a spot on the
   pavement over which the bowls had passed even the shipcaptain did not
   like that spot and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled
   kings palace rises manydomed and marvellous

   the ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow all but the broad
   curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in
   yakdrawn chariots carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was
   all steps between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold and
   under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of
   music or breaths of exotic fragrance always ahead loomed those titan
   walls mighty buttresses and clustered and bulbous domes for which the
   veiled kings palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great
   black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarchs pleasure there
   carter paused in faintness at so much beauty for the onyx terraces and
   colonnaded walks the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees
   espaliered to golden lattices the brazen urns and tripods with cunning
   basreliefs the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined
   black marble the basaltbottomed lagoons tiled fountains with
   luminous fish the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven
   columns the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates and the
   blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all
   joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality and
   halffabulous even in the land of dreams there it shimmered like a
   vision under that grey twilight sky with the domed and fretted
   magnificence of the palace ahead and the fantastic silhouette of the
   distant impassable peaks on the right and ever the small birds and the
   fountains sang while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil
   over that incredible garden no other human presence was there and
   carter was glad it was so then they turned and descended again the
   onyx alley of steps for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it
   is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome
   since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured
   shantakbirds and to send out queer dreams to the curious

   after that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town
   near the gate of the caravans where are the taverns of the
   yakmerchants and the onyxminers and there in a lowceiled inn of
   quarrymen they said farewell; for business called the captain whilst
   carter was eager to talk with miners about the north there were many
   men in that inn and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of
   them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx and anxious to know
   somewhat of inquanoks quarries but all that he learned was not much
   more than he knew before for the miners were timid and evasive about
   the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits they
   had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is
   said to lie and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north
   among the scattered rocks and they whispered also that the rumoured
   shantakbirds are no wholesome things; it being indeed for the best
   that no man has ever truly seen one (for that fabled father of shantaks
   in the kings dome is fed in the dark)

   the next day saying that he wished to look over all the various mines
   for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages
   of inquanok carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddlebags
   for a journey beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight
   betwixt tilled fields with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes
   at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions; once
   finding a host so austere and reticent and so full of an unplaced
   majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek that he felt
   certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves or
   upon one with full ninetenths of their blood dwelling amongst men
   and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very
   well of the gods and to praise all the blessings they had ever
   accorded him

   that night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great
   lygathtree to which he tied his yak and in the morning resumed his
   northward pilgrimage at about ten oclock he reached the smalldomed
   village of urg where traders rest and miners tell their tales and
   paused in its taverns till noon it is here that the great caravan road
   turns west toward selarn but carter kept on north by the quarry road
   all the afternoon he followed that rising road which was somewhat
   narrower than the great highway and which now led through a region
   with more rocks than tilled fields and by evening the low hills on his
   left had risen into sizable black cliffs so that he knew he was close
   to the mining country all the while the great gaunt sides of the
   impassable mountains towered afar off at his right and the farther he
   went the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and
   traders and drivers of lumbering onyxcarts along the way

   on the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag
   tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground he observed the
   greater phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point and more
   than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them and on the
   third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry and greeted
   the men who there laboured with picks and chisels before evening he
   had passed eleven quarries; the land being here given over altogether
   to onyx cliffs and boulders with no vegetation at all but only great
   rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth with the grey
   impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right the
   third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires
   cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west and they
   sang many songs and told many tales shewing such strange knowledge of
   the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held
   many latent memories of their sires the great ones they asked him
   whither he went and cautioned him not to go too far to the north; but
   he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx and would take no
   more risks than were common among prospectors in the morning he bade
   them adieu and rode on into the darkening north where they had warned
   him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older
   than mens hands had wrenched prodigious blocks but he did not like it
   when turning back to wave a last farewell he thought he saw
   approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting
   eyes whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant
   dylathleen

   after two more quarries the inhabited part of inquanok seemed to end
   and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yakpath among forbidding
   black cliffs always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks
   and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm
   he found it grew darker and colder soon he perceived that there were
   no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath and realised
   that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time
   once in a while a raven would croak far overhead and now and then a
   flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of
   the rumoured shantakbird but in the main he was alone with his shaggy
   steed and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became
   more and more reluctant to advance and more and more disposed to snort
   affrightedly at any small noise along the route

   the path now contracted between sable and glistening walls and began
   to display an even greater steepness than before it was a bad footing
   and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about
   in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest beyond which was
   nothing but dull grey sky and blessed the prospect of a level or
   downward course to reach this crest however was no easy task; for
   the way had grown nearly perpendicular and was perilous with loose
   black gravel and small stones eventually carter dismounted and led his
   dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled and
   keeping his own footing as best he might then suddenly he came to the
   top and saw beyond and gasped at what he saw

   the path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down with the same
   lines of high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there
   opened out a monstrous space vast acres in extent where some archaic
   power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a
   giants quarry far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean
   gouge and deep down within earths bowels its lower delvings yawned
   it was no quarry of man and the concave sides were scarred with great
   squares yards wide which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by
   nameless hands and chisels high over its jagged rim huge ravens
   flapped and croaked and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of
   bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless
   blackness there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight
   with the rocky path sloping down before him; tall onyx cliffs on his
   right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left
   chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry

   all at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control leaping
   past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow
   slope toward the north stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over
   the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any
   sound of striking bottom; but carter ignored the perils of that scanty
   path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed soon the
   leftbehind cliffs resumed their course making the way once more a
   narrow lane; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose
   great wide prints told of its desperate flight

   once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast and
   doubled his speed from this encouragement he was covering miles and
   little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must
   soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north the gaunt grey
   flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the
   righthand crags and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open
   space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain
   and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears plainer than before
   but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he
   realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing
   yak the beats were ruthless and purposeful and they were behind him

   carters pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing
   for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the
   presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable his yak
   must have heard or felt it first and he did not like to ask himself
   whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up
   out of that black quarry pit meanwhile the cliffs had been left
   behind so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and
   spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost he could not see the
   hoofprints of his yak but always from behind him there came that
   detestable clopping; mingled now and then with what he fancied were
   titanic flappings and whirrings that he was losing ground seemed
   unhappily clear to him and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this
   broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands
   only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense
   of direction and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned
   and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place

   then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a
   terrible thing he had thought it for some moments a range of black
   mountains but now he saw it was something more the phosphorescence of
   the brooding clouds shewed it plainly and even silhouetted parts of it
   as vapours glowed behind how distant it was he could not tell but it
   must have been very far it was thousands of feet high stretching in a
   great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined
   westward spaces and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills
   but now these hills were hills no more for some hand greater than
   mans had touched them silent they squatted there atop the world like
   wolves or ghouls crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the
   secrets of the north forever all in a great half circle they squatted
   those doglike mountains carven into monstrous watching statues and
   their right hands were raised in menace against mankind

   it was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred
   double heads seem to move but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from
   their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion winged
   and whirring those forms grew larger each moment and the traveller
   knew his stumbling was at an end they were not any birds or bats known
   elsewhere on earth or in dreamland for they were larger than elephants
   and had heads like a horses carter knew that they must be the
   shantakbirds of ill rumour and wondered no more what evil guardians
   and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert and as he
   stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him where
   indeed was trotting the squat slanteyed trader of evil legend
   grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering
   shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether
   pits

   trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares
   that pressed around in great unholy circles randolph carter did not
   lose consciousness lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered
   above him while the slanteyed merchant leaped down from his yak and
   stood grinning before the captive then the man motioned carter to
   mount one of the repugnant shantaks helping him up as his judgement
   struggled with his loathing it was hard work ascending for the
   shantakbird has scales instead of feathers and those scales are very
   slippery once he was seated the slanteyed man hopped up behind him
   leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven
   mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi

   there now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space endlessly up
   and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains
   beyond which leng was said to be far above the clouds they flew till
   at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of
   inquanok have never seen and which lie always in high vortices of
   gleaming mist carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below
   and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of
   those on ngranek; but he did not question his captor about these things
   when he noticed that both the man and the horseheaded shantak appeared
   oddly fearful of them hurrying past nervously and shewing great
   tension until they were left far in the rear

   the shantak now flew lower revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a
   grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires
   as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and
   bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light and
   there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a
   nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inquanoks people
   are right in their geographic rumours for travellers have heard such
   sounds before and know that they float only from the cold desert
   plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and
   mystery which is leng

   around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing and carter was curious
   as to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have
   ever been to leng and the place is known only by its fires and stone
   huts as seen from afar very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap
   and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that
   carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague
   legend or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen
   plateau as the shantak flew lower the repulsiveness of the dancers
   became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept
   straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had
   seen such creatures before

   they leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet and seemed to
   wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns of other clothing
   they had none but most of them were quite furry behind they had
   dwarfish tails and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width
   of their mouths then he knew what they were and that they did not
   wear any wigs or headpieces after all for the cryptic folk of leng
   were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys
   that traded rubies at dylathleen; those not quite human merchants who
   are the slaves of the monstrous moonthings! they were indeed the same
   dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long
   ago and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean
   wharves of that accursed lunar city with the leaner ones toiling and
   the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous
   and amorphous masters now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came
   from and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these
   formless abominations from the moon

   but the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less
   than human dancers and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and
   dim wastes of rock and ice and snow day came and the phosphorescence
   of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world
   and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence
   at times the slanteyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and
   guttural language and the shantak would answer with tittering tones
   that rasped like the scratching of ground glass ali this while the
   land was getting higher and finally they came to a windswept
   tableland which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless
   world there all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold rose the
   uncouth stones of a squat windowless building around which a circle of
   crude monoliths stood in all this arrangement there was nothing human
   and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most
   dreadful and legendary of all places the remote and prehistoric
   monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the highpriest not to be
   described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to
   the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep

   the loathsome bird now settled to the ground and the slanteyed man
   hopped down and helped his captive alight of the purpose of his
   seizure carter now felt very sure; for clearly the slanteyed merchant
   was an agent of the darker powers eager to drag before his masters a
   mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and
   the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx
   castle it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former
   capture by the slaves of the moonthings in dylathleen and that he
   now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim
   to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with
   what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried leng and
   the cold waste north of inquanok must be close to the other gods and
   there the passes to kadath are well guarded

   the slanteyed man was small but the great hippocephalic bird was
   there to see he was obeyed; so carter followed where he led and passed
   within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of
   that windowless stone monastery there were no lights inside but the
   evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid basreliefs and
   prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors on
   the walls of the corridors were printed frightful scenes older than
   history and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth after
   countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still for the cold and
   dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things carter saw them
   fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp and shuddered at
   the tale they told

   through those archaic frescoes lengs annals stalked; and the horned
   hooved and widemouthed almosthumans danced evilly amidst forgotten
   cities there were scenes of old wars wherein lengs almosthumans
   fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and
   there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the
   moon and of the submission of lengs people to the polypous and
   amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of
   them those slippery greyishwhite blasphemies they worshipped as gods
   nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were
   taken away in the black galleys the monstrous moonbeasts made their
   camp on a jagged isle in the sea and carter could tell from the
   frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had
   seen when sailing to inquanok; that grey accursed rock which inquanoks
   seamen shun and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the
   night

   and in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the
   almosthumans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt
   wharves and wondrous with high fanes and carven places great gardens
   and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six
   sphinxcrowned gates to a vast central plaza and in that plaza was a
   pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene
   staircase again and again were those huge winged lions shewn their
   mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and
   the cloudy phosphorescence of the night and as carter stumbled past
   their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed
   they were and what city it was that the almosthumans had ruled so
   anciently before the coming of the black galleys there could be no
   mistake for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse
   indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied
   sarkomand whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the
   first true human saw the light and whose twin titan lions guard
   eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyss

   other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inquanok
   and the monstrous shantakbirds that build nests on the ledges half way
   up and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost
   pinnacles and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away
   from them carter had seen those caves when he passed over them and
   had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek now he knew that
   the likeness was more than a chance one for in these pictures were
   shewn their fearsome denizens; and those batwings curving horns
   barbed tails prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to
   him he had met those silent flitting and clutching creatures before;
   those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones
   fear and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord for
   they were the dreaded nightgaunts who never laugh or smile because
   they have no faces and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the
   vale of pnath and the passes to the outer world

   the slanteyed merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space
   whose walls were carved in shocking basreliefs and whose centre held
   a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars
   in a ring there was no light in this vast evilsmelling crypt and the
   small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could
   grasp details only little by little at the farther end was a high
   stone dais reached by five steps; and there on a golden throne sat a
   lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a
   yellow silken mask over its face to this being the slanteyed man made
   certain signs with his hands and the lurker in the dark replied by
   raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silkcovered paws and
   blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask
   this colloquy went on for some time and to carter there was something
   sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the
   malodorous place it made him think of a frightful redlitten city and
   of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that and of
   an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond before the rescuing
   rush of earths friendly cats he knew that the creature on the dais
   was without doubt the highpriest not to be described of which legend
   whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities but he feared to
   think just what that abhorred highpriest might be

   then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyishwhite
   paws and carter knew what the noisome highpriest was and in that
   hideous second stark fear drove him to something his reason would
   never have dared to attempt for in all his shaken consciousness there
   was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that
   golden throne he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt
   him and the cold tableland outside and that even on that tableland
   the noxious shantek still waited; yet in spite of all this there was in
   his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling
   silkrobed monstrosity

   the slanteyed man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and
   wickedly stained altarstones by the pit and had moved forward
   somewhat to talk to the highpriest with his hands carter hitherto
   wholly passive now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild
   strength of fear so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping
   well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin
   where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark in almost the same second he seized
   the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths
   racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think
   of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him or
   of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back
   there in lightless corridors

   after a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste and wished he
   had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in
   true they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have
   done him much good but he wished none the less he had made the
   attempt those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had
   seen then and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside in
   time he became quite sure he was not followed and slackened his pace
   somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a new peril
   beset him his lamp was waning and he would soon be in pitch blackness
   with no means of sight or guidance

   when the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark and prayed to
   the great ones for such help as they might afford at times he felt the
   stone floor sloping up or down and once he stumbled over a step for
   which no reason seemed to exist the farther he went the damper it
   seemed to be and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a
   side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least
   he believed though that his general course was down; and the
   vaultlike smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike
   warned him he was burrowing deep in lengs unwholesome tableland but
   there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the
   thing itself with its terror and shock and breathtaking chaos one
   moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level
   place and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark
   through a burrow which must have been wellnigh vertical

   of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure but it
   seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy then he
   realized he was still with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern
   night shining sickly above him all around were crumbling walls and
   broken columns and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by
   straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots
   behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side
   sculptured into repellent scenes and pierced by an arched and carven
   entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come ahead
   stretched double rows of pillars and the fragments and pedestals of
   pillars that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and
   basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens far
   off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza and in
   that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a
   pair of monstrous things huge winged lions of diarite they were with
   blackness and shadow between them full twenty feet they reared their
   grotesque and unbroken heads and snarled derisive on the ruins around
   them and carter knew right well what they must be for legend tells of
   only one such twain they were the changeless guardians of the great
   abyss and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomand

   carters first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff
   with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around he wished no
   follower from lengs hateful monastery for along the way ahead would
   lurk enough of other dangers of how to get from sarkomand to the
   peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain
   much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls since he knew they
   were no better informed than he the three ghouls which had helped him
   through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach
   sarkomand in their journey back but had planned to ask old traders in
   dylathleen he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene
   world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its
   cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood yet he felt he might
   have to try this course if all else failed over lengs plateau past
   the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the highpriests
   emissaries must be many while at the journeys end there would no
   doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with if he
   could get a boat he might sail back to inquanok past the jagged and
   hideous rock in the sea for the primal frescoes in the monastery
   labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from
   sarkomands basalt quays but to find a boat in this aeondeserted city
   was no probable thing and it did not appear likely that he could ever
   make one

   such were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began
   beating upon his mind all this while there had stretched before him
   the great corpselike width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken
   pillars and crumbling sphinxcrowned gates and titan stones and
   monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night
   clouds now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds
   could account for and knew he was not alone in the silence of that
   dead city the glow rose and fell fitfully flickering with a greenish
   tinge which did not reassure the watcher and when he crept closer
   down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled
   walls he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many
   vague forms clustered darkly around it; and a lethal odour hanging
   heavily over all beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with
   a great ship riding at anchor and carter paused in stark terror when
   he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from
   the moon

   then just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame he
   saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and
   unmistakable sound it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul and in a
   moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish secure as he
   was in the shadow of monstrous ruins carter allowed his curiosity to
   conquer his fear and crept forward again instead of retreating once
   in crossing an open street he wriggled wormlike on his stomach and in
   another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among
   heaps of fallen marble but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery
   so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where
   he could watch the whole greenlitten scene of action there around a
   hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi there squatted
   a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their almosthuman
   slaves some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the
   leaping flames and at intervals applying their whitehot points to
   three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of
   the party from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that
   the bluntsnouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely and
   vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and
   knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio
   which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out
   from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native
   deeps

   the number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very
   great and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former
   allies of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but
   fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in
   dylathleen concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to
   approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the highpriest not
   to be described for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do and
   recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls black kingdom
   clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and
   descend at once to the gulf where assuredly he would meet no horrors
   worse than those above and where he might soon find ghouls eager to
   rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the
   black galley it occurred to him that the portal like other gates to
   the abyss might be guarded by flocks of nightgaunts; but he did not
   fear these faceless creatures now he had learned that they are bound
   by solemn treaties with the ghouls and the ghoul which was pickman had
   taught him how to glibber a password they understood

   so carter began another silent crawl through the ruins edging slowly
   toward the great central plaza and the winged lions it was ticklish
   work but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the
   slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered
   stones at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the
   stunned trees and vines that had grown up therein the gigantic lions
   loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent
   night clouds but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept
   round to their faces knowing it was on that side he would find the
   mighty darkness which they guard ten feet apart crouched the
   mockingfaced beasts of diarite brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose
   sides were chiselled in fearsome basreliefs betwixt them was a tiled
   court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of
   onyx midway in this space a black well opened and carter soon saw
   that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy
   stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare

   terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore
   themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a
   fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs so worn and narrow were
   the steps and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth that the climber
   never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to
   the ultimate pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the
   guardian nightgaunts would suddenly pounce upon him if indeed there
   were any stationed in this primeval passage all about him was a
   stifling odour of nether gulfs and he felt that the air of these
   choking depths was not made for mankind in time he became very numb
   and somnolent moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned
   will; nor did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether
   as something quietly seized him from behind he was flying very rapidly
   through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery
   nightgaunts had performed their duty

   awaked to the fact that he was in the cold damp clutch of the faceless
   flutterers carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered
   it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight mindless
   though nightgaunts are said to be the effect was instantaneous; for
   all tickling stopped at once and the creatures hastened to shift their
   captive to a more comfortable position thus encouraged carter ventured
   some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls
   by the moonbeasts and of the need of assembling a party to rescue
   them the nightgaunts though inarticulate seemed to understand what
   was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight
   suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner
   earth and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on
   which ghouls love to squat and gnaw scattered tombstones and osseous
   fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as carter gave a loud
   meep of urgent summons a score of burrows emptied forth their
   leathery doglike tenants the nightgaunts now flew low and set their
   passenger upon his feet afterward withdrawing a little and forming a
   hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer

   carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque
   company and four of them at once departed through different burrows to
   spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available
   for a rescue after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared
   and made significant signs to the nightgaunts causing two of the
   latter to fly off into the dark thereafter there were constant
   accessions to the hunched flock of nightgaunts on the plain till at
   length the slimy soil was fairly black with them meanwhile fresh
   ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one all glibbering excitedly
   and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled
   nightgaunts in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul
   which was once the artist richard pickman of boston and to him carter
   glibbered a very full account of what had occurred the erstwhile
   pickman pleased to greet his ancient friend again seemed very much
   impressed and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from
   the growing throng

   finally after scanning the ranks with care the assembled chiefs all
   meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls
   and nightgaunts a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at
   once while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with
   extended forelegs awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one as
   each ghoul reached the pair of nightgaunts to which he was assigned
   he was taken up and borne away into the blackness; till at last the
   whole throng had vanished save for carter pickman and the other
   chiefs and a few pairs of nightgaunts pickman explained that
   nightgaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls and
   that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the
   moonbeasts then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting
   bearers and were taken up by the damp slippery paws another moment
   and all were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly up up up to the
   gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal sarkomand

   when after a great interval carter saw again the sickly light of
   sarkomands nocturnal sky it was to behold the great central plaza
   swarming with militant ghouls and nightgaunts day he felt sure must
   be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy
   would be needed the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered
   faintly though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture
   of the prisoners was over for the nonce softly glibbering directions
   to their steeds and to the flock of riderless nightgaunts ahead the
   ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the
   bleak ruins toward the evil flame carter was now beside pickman in the
   front rank of ghouls and saw as they approached the noisome camp that
   the moonbeasts were totally unprepared the three prisoners lay bound
   and inert beside the fire while their toadlike captors slumped
   drowsily about in no certain order the almosthuman slaves were
   asleep even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must
   have seemed to them merely perfunctory

   the final swoop of the nightgaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden
   each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almosthuman slaves
   being seized by a group of nightgaunts before a sound was made the
   moonbeasts of course were voiceless; and even the slaves had little
   chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence horrible
   were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the
   sardonic nightgaunts clutched them but nothing availed against the
   strength of those black prehensile talons when a moonbeast writhed too
   violently a nightgaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink
   tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its
   struggles carter expected to see much slaughter but found that the
   ghouls were far subtler in their plans they glibbered certain simple
   orders to the nightgaunts which held the captives trusting the rest
   to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away
   into the great abyss to be distributed impartially amongst the dholes
   gugs ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment
   are not painless to their chosen victims meanwhile the three bound
   ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk
   whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for possible remaining
   moonbeasts and boarded the evilsmelling black galley at the wharf to
   make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat surely enough
   the capture had been thorough for not a sign of further life could the
   victors detect carter anxious to preserve a means of access to the
   rest of dreamland urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this
   request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting
   the plight of the captured trio on the ship were found some very
   curious objects and decorations some of which carter cast at once into
   the sea

   ghouls and nightgaunts now formed themselves in separate groups the
   former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings it
   appeared that the three had followed carters directions and proceeded
   from the enchanted wood to dylathleen by way of nir and the skai
   stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as
   possible in the fashion of a mans walk in dylathleens taverns their
   grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment; but they had
   persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller
   was able to tell them then they knew that only a ship for lelagleng
   would serve their purpose and prepared to wait patiently for such a
   vessel

   but evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley
   put into port and the widemouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls
   to drink with them in a tavern wine was produced from one of those
   sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby and after that
   the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had
   found himself this time however the unseen rowers steered not for
   the moon but for antique sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their
   captives before the highpriest not to be described they had touched
   at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inquanoks mariners shun
   and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the red masters of the
   ship; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of
   malign shapelessness and fearsome odour there too were witnessed the
   nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrisonsuch pastimes as
   give rise to the nighthowlings which men fear after that had come the
   landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures whose
   continuance the present rescue had prevented

   future plans were next discussed the three rescued ghouls suggesting a
   raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison
   there to this however the nightgaunts objected; since the prospect
   of flying over water did not please them most of the ghouls favoured
   the design but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the
   winged nightgaunts thereupon carter seeing that they could not
   navigate the anchored galley offered to teach them the use of the
   great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented grey day
   had now come and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of
   ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers
   benches carter found them fairly apt at learning and before night had
   risked several experimental trips around the harbour not till three
   days later however did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of
   conquest then the rowers trained and the nightgaunts safely stowed
   in the forecastle the party set sail at last; pickman and the other
   chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and
   procedure

   on the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard such was
   their timbre that all the galleys crew shook visibly; but most of all
   trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those
   howlings meant it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night
   so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn
   of a greyish day when the light was ample and the howlings still the
   rowers resumed their strokes and the galley drew closer and closer to
   that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the
   dull sky the sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and
   there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings
   and the low railings guarding travelled highroads no ship of men had
   ever come so near the place or at least had never come so near and
   departed again; but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept
   inflexibly on rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the
   wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side
   within a harbour formed of steep headlands

   the headlands were prolongations of the island proper and came so
   closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them
   there seemed to be no watchers on the outside so the galley was
   steered boldly through the flumelike strait and into the stagnant
   putrid harbour beyond here however all was bustle and activity; with
   several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay and scores
   of almosthuman slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates
   and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering
   lorries there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff
   above the wharves with the start of a winding road that spiralled out
   of sight toward higher ledges of the rock of what lay inside that
   prodigious peak of granite none might say but the things one saw on
   the outside were far from encouraging

   at sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed
   much eagerness; those with eyes staring intently and those without
   eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly they did not of
   course realize that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look
   much like the horned and hooved almosthumans and the nightgaunts
   were all out of sight below by this time the leaders had fully formed
   a plan; which was to loose the nightgaunts as soon as the wharf was
   touched and then to sail directly away leaving matters wholly to the
   instincts of those almostmindless creatures marooned on the rock the
   horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they
   found there and afterward quite helpless to think except in terms of
   the homing instinct would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly
   back to the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate
   destinations in the dark from which not much would emerge alive

   the ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the nightgaunts
   their simple instructions while the ship drew very near to the ominous
   and malodorous wharves presently a fresh stir rose along the
   waterfront and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to
   excite suspicion evidently the steersman was not making for the right
   dock and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the
   hideous ghouls and the almosthuman slaves whose places they were
   taking some silent alarm must have been given for almost at once a
   horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black
   doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the
   right a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the
   wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this
   point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of
   whirring nightgaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of
   horned and cyclopean bats

   the jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to
   push off the invading ship but when the nightgaunts struck them they
   thought of such things no more it was a very terrible spectacle to see
   those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime and tremendously
   impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town
   and up the winding roadway to the reaches above sometimes a group of
   the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by
   mistake and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly
   offensive to the sight and smell when the last of the nightgaunts had
   left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal
   and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey
   headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest

   the pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the nightgaunts to make up
   their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea
   and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he
   waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men night fell and the
   grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds
   and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed
   rock for signs of the nightgaunts flight toward morning a black
   speck was seen hovering timidly over the topmost pinnacle and shortly
   afterward the speck had become a swarm just before daybreak the swarm
   seemed to scatter and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished
   wholly in the distance toward the northeast once or twice something
   seemed to fall from the thing swarm into the sea; but carter did not
   worry since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts
   cannot swim at length when the ghouls were satisfied that all the
   nightgaunts had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their
   doomed burdens the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey
   headlands; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over
   the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled
   from the solid stone

   frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless
   crypts; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many and in
   various stages of departure from their primal state carter put out of
   the way certain things which were after a fashion alive and fled
   precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very
   positive the stenchfilled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque
   stools and benches carven from moontrees and were painted inside with
   nameless and frantic designs countless weapons implements and
   ornaments lay about including some large idols of solid ruby depicting
   singular beings not found on the earth these latter did not despite
   their material invite either appropriation or long inspection; and
   carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces
   the scattered spears and javelins he collected and with pickmans
   approval distributed among the ghouls such devices were new to the
   doglike lopers but their relative simplicity made them easy to master
   after a few concise hints

   the upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes and
   in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and
   doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more
   monstrous than the wild gods atop kadath from the rear of one great
   temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the
   rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast
   proportions whose vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in
   whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous
   monastery of leng where broods alone the highpriest not to be
   described on the distant shadowy side beyond the noisome well he
   thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze; but for
   some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even
   approaching it and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely
   allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could
   scarcely feel the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the
   moonbeasts and had profited in their fashion they had also found a
   hogshead of potent moonwine and were rolling it down to the wharves
   for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings though the rescued
   trio remembering its effect on them in dylathleen had warned their
   company to taste none of it of rubies from lunar mines there was a
   great store both rough and polished in one of the vaults near the
   water; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost
   all interest in them carter did not try to carry any away since he
   knew too much about those which had mined them

   suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the
   wharves and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to
   stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront betwixt the grey
   headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing and it would be
   but a moment before the almosthumans on deck would perceive the
   invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below
   fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter
   had distributed amongst them; and at his command sustained by the
   being that was pickman they now formed a line of battle and prepared
   to prevent the landing of the ship presently a burst of excitement on
   the galley told of the crews discovery of the changed state of things
   and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers
   of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account after a moment of
   hesitation the new comers silently turned and passed out between the
   headlands again but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the
   conflict was averted either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or
   the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island; hence a party of
   scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemys
   course would be

   in a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the
   moonbeasts and almosthumans were landing on the outside of the more
   easterly of the rugged grey headlands and ascending by hidden paths
   and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety almost
   immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the
   flumelike strait but only for a second then a few moments later a
   second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was
   landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the
   size of the galley would seem to allow for the ship itself moving
   slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars soon hove in sight
   betwixt the cliffs and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the
   coming fray and stand by for any possible use

   by this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three
   parties one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain
   in the town the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their
   respective directions while the third was subdivided into a land party
   and a sea party the sea party commanded by carter boarded the
   anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the
   newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open
   sea carter did not at once pursue it for he knew he might be needed
   more acutely near the town

   meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almosthumans
   had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly
   silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky the thin
   hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine and the general
   effect of those hybrid halfamorphous processions was as nauseating as
   the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies then the
   two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted
   panorama javelins began to fly from both sides and the swelling meeps
   of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almosthumans gradually
   joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and
   indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony now and then bodies fell from
   the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour
   inside in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain
   submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious
   bubbles

   for half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky till upon the west
   cliff the invaders were completely annihilated on the east cliff
   however where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be
   present the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating
   to the slopes of the pinnacle proper pickman had quickly ordered
   reinforcements for this front from the party in the town and these had
   helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat then when the
   western battle was over the victorious survivors hastened across to
   the aid of their hardpressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the
   invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland the
   almosthumans were by this time all slain but the last of the toadlike
   horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their
   powerful and disgusting paws the time for javelins was now nearly
   past and the fight became a handtohand contest of what few spearmen
   could meet upon that narrow ridge

   as fury and recklessness increased the number falling into the sea
   became very great those striking the harbour met nameless extinction
   from the unseen bubblers but of those striking the open sea some were
   able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks while
   the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts the cliffs
   were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked so that none of
   the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battleline some were
   killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts
   above but a few survived to be rescued when the security of the land
   parties seemed assured carters galley sallied forth between the
   headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue
   such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean
   several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of
   the way

   finally the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the
   invading land army concentrated in one place carter landed a
   considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemys rear; after
   which the fight was shortlived indeed attacked from both sides the
   noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea
   till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again
   clear of them the hostile galley meanwhile had disappeared; and it
   was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before
   any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought
   against the victors

   so by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted
   them with care finding that over a fourth had been lost in the days
   battles the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley for pickman
   always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating ones
   own wounded and the ablebodied troops were assigned to the oars or to
   such other places as they might most usefully fill under the low
   phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed and carter was not
   sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets whose
   lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door
   lingered restlessly in his fancy dawn found the ship in sight of
   sarkomands ruined quays of basalt where a few nightgaunt sentries
   still waited squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken
   columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and
   died before the years of man

   the ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand
   despatching a messenger for enough nightgaunts to serve them as
   steeds pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude
   for the aid carter had lent them carter now began to feel that his
   plans were indeed maturing well and that he would be able to command
   the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of
   dreamland but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown
   kadath and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from
   his slumbers accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish
   leaders; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands
   and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into
   doubleheaded images which guard it he spoke of the fear of shantaks
   for nightgaunts and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming
   from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide
   inquanok from hateful leng he spoke too of the things he had learned
   concerning nightgaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery
   of the highpriest not to be described; how even the great ones fear
   them and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at
   all but hoary and immemorial nodens lord of the great abyss

   all these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls and
   presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did
   not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately
   rendered the rubbery doglike lopers he wished very much he said for
   the services of enough nightgaunts to bear him safely through the aft
   past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains and up into the old
   waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal he desired to
   fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead
   with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him and felt sure
   that the nightgaunts could take him thither without trouble; high
   above the perils of the plain and over the hideous double heads of
   those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk
   for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from
   aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them and even
   were unexpected things to come from the other gods who are prone to
   oversee the affairs of earths milder gods the nightgaunts need not
   fear; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and
   slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master but bow only
   to potent and archaic nodens

   a flock of ten or fifteen nightgaunts carter glibbered would surely
   be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance though
   perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the
   creatures their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than
   to men the party could land him at some convenient point within
   whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have waiting in the
   shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the
   castle to give prayer to the gods of earth if any ghouls chose to
   escort him into the throneroom of the great ones he would be
   thankful for their presence would add weight and importance to his
   plea he would not however insist upon this but merely wished
   transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath; the final
   journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself in case of
   gods proved favourable or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber
   in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless

   whilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great
   attention and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds
   of those nightgaunts for which messengers had been sent the winged
   steeds settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army waiting
   respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the
   earthly traveller the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with
   his fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at
   most expected as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the
   moonbeasts so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence
   none had ever returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied
   nightgaunts but their entire army as then encamped veteran fighting
   ghouls and newly assembled nightgaunts alike save only a small
   garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from
   the jagged rock in the sea they would set out through the aft whenever
   he might wish and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls
   would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earths gods
   in their onyx castle

   moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words carter made plans
   with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage the army would fly
   high they decided over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and
   wicked stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer
   with the shantakfrightening nightgaunts whose burrows honeycombed
   their summits they would then according to what advice they might
   receive from those denizens choose their final course; approaching
   unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of
   inquanok or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng
   itself doglike and soulless as they are the ghouls and nightgaunts
   had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal; nor did they
   feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its
   onyx castle of mystery

   about midday the ghouls and nightgaunts prepared for flight each
   ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him carter
   was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman and in
   front of the whole a double line of riderless nightgaunts was provided
   as a vanguard at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army
   rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling
   sphinxes of primordial sarkomand; higher and higher till even the
   great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared and the cold sterile
   tableland of lengs outskirts laid open to sight still higher flew
   the black host till even this tableland grew small beneath them; and
   as they worked northward over the windswept plateau of horror carter
   saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the
   squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful
   silkenmasked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped
   this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the
   sterile landscape passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone
   villages at a great altitude and pausing not at all to mark the morbid
   twistings of the hooved horned almosthumans that dance and pipe
   eternally therein once they saw a shantakbird flying low over the
   plain but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to
   the north in grotesque panic

   at dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of
   inquanok and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which
   carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks at the insistent
   meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty
   burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and
   nightgaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly
   gestures it soon became clear that the best course would be that over
   the cold waste north of inquanok for lengs northward reaches are full
   of unseen pitfalls that even the nightgaunts dislike; abysmal
   influences centering in certain white hemispherical buildings on
   curious knolls which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the
   other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep

   of kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing save that
   there must be some mighty marvel toward the north over which the
   shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard they hinted at rumoured
   abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond and
   recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally; but of
   definite data they had nothing to give so carter and his party thanked
   them kindly; and crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies
   of inquanok dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds
   and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were
   mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock

   there they squatted in a hellish halfcircle their legs on the desert
   sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister wolflike
   and doubleheaded with faces of fury and right hands raised dully and
   malignly watching the rim of mans world and guarding with horror the
   reaches of a cold northern world that is not mans from their hideous
   laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk but these all fled with
   insane titters as the vanguard of nightgaunts was sighted in the misty
   sky northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew and over
   leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose less and less
   luminous grew the clouds till at length carter could see only
   blackness around him; but never did the winged steeds falter bred as
   they were in earths blackest crypts and seeing not with any eyes but
   with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms on and on they
   flew past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in
   thickest darkness and covering such prodigious spaces that carter
   wondered whether or not they could still be within earths dreamland

   then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above
   all below was still black but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed
   alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed
   elsewhere it was not that the figures of the constellations were
   different but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a
   significance they had formerly failed to make plain everything
   focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the glittering
   sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the
   eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal
   of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead
   carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks
   had towered along all the length of inquanok and saw against the stars
   a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence it was more
   broken now with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles;
   and carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and inclinations of
   that grotesque outline which seemed to share with the stars some
   subtle northward urge

   they were flying past at a tremendous speed so that the watcher had to
   strain hard to catch details; when all at once he beheld just above the
   line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars
   whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party the
   ghouls had likewise glimpsed it for he heard their low glibbering all
   about him and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic
   shantak of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen
   soon however he saw that this theory would not hold; for the shape of
   the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird
   its outline against the stars necessarily vague as it was resembled
   rather some huge mitred head or pair of heads infinitely magnified;
   and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a
   wingless one carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was
   on but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first
   seen since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was
   deeply cleft

   then came a wide gap in the range where the hideous reaches of
   transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low
   pass through which the stars shone wanly carter watched this gap with
   intense care knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond
   it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the
   pinnacles the object had now floated ahead a trifle and every eye of
   the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in
   fulllength silhouette gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared
   the gap slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having
   outdistanced the ghoulish army for another minute suspense was keen
   and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came;
   bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and halfchoked meep of
   cosmic fear and to the soul of the traveller a chill that never wholly
   left it for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was
   only a heada mitred double headand below it in terrible vastness
   loped the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountainhigh
   monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence; the hyaenalike
   distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the
   sky its repulsive pair of conecapped heads reaching half way to the
   zenith

   carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud for he was an
   old dreamer; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he
   saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level
   of the peaks bobbing along stealthily after the first one and
   straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full
   against the southern stars tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly their
   tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft the carven mountains
   then had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of
   inquanok with right hands uplifted they had duties to perform and
   were not remiss but it was horrible that they never spoke and never
   even made a sound in walking

   meanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the
   nightgaunts and the whole army soared higher into the air up toward
   the stars the grotesque column shot till nothing stood out any longer
   against the sky; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the
   carven mitred mountains that walked all was blackness beneath as the
   fluttering legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible
   laughter in the aether and never a shantak or less mentionable entity
   rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them the farther they went the
   faster they flew till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of
   a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit carter
   wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath
   them but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange
   properties that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain
   and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasized
   their northward focus; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the
   flying army into the void of the boreal pole as the folds of a bag are
   gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein

   then he noticed with terror that the wings of the nightgaunts were not
   flapping any more the horned and faceless steeds had folded their
   membranous appendages and were resting quite passive in the chaos of
   wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on a force not of earth
   had seized on the army and ghouls and nightgaunts alike were
   powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the
   north whence no mortal had ever returned at length a lone pallid light
   was seen on the skyline ahead thereafter rising steadily as they
   approached and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the
   stars carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain for only a
   mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the
   air

   higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it till all
   the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass lofty as the
   army was that pale and sinister beacon rose above it towering
   monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth and tasting the
   atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel no
   mountain known of man was that which loomed before them the high
   clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills the groping
   dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins scornful and
   spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven black in eternal
   night and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and
   significant outline grew every moment clearer ghouls meeped in wonder
   as they saw it and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army
   be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliff

   higher and higher rose the light till it mingled with the loftiest
   orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery
   all the north beneath it was blackness now; dread stony blackness from
   infinite depths to infinite heights with only that pale winking beacon
   perched unreachably at the top of all vision carter studied the light
   more closely and saw at last what lines its inky background made
   against the stars there were towers on that titan mountaintop;
   horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters
   beyond any dreamable workmanship of man; battlements and terraces of
   wonder and menace all limned tiny and black and distant against the
   starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight
   capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all
   mortal thought and in it glowed the daemonlight then randolph carter
   knew that his quest was done and that he saw above him the goal of all
   forbidden steps and audacious visions; the fabulous the incredible
   home of the great ones atop unknown kadath

   even as he realised this thing carter noticed a change in the course
   of the helplessly windsucked party they were rising abruptly now and
   it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where
   the pale light shone so close was the great black mountain that its
   sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward and in the darkness
   they could discern nothing upon it vaster and vaster loomed the
   tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above and carter could see that
   it was wellnigh blasphemous in its immensity well might its stones
   have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out
   of the rock in the hill pass north of inquanok for such was its size
   that a man on its threshold stood even as air out on the steps of
   earths loftiest fortress the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad
   domed turrets glowed with a sallow sickly flare so that a kind of
   twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx the pallid beacon
   was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the
   loftiest towers and as the helpless army neared the top of the
   mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across
   the feebly luminous expanse it was a strangely arched window of a
   design wholly alien to earth

   the solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous
   castle and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated
   vast walls shot up and there was a glimpse of a great gate through
   which the voyagers were swept all was night in the titan courtyard
   and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched
   portal engulfed the column vortices of cold wind surged dankly through
   sightless labyrinths of onyx and carter could never tell what
   cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his
   endless aerial twisting always upward led the terrible plunge in
   darkness and never a sound touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of
   mystery large as the army of ghouls and nightgaunts was it was lost
   in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle and when at
   last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single
   tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon it took carter
   long to discern the far walls and high distant ceiling and to realize
   that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside

   randolph carter had hoped to come into the throneroom of the great
   ones with poise and dignity flanked and followed by impressive lines
   of ghouls in ceremonial order and offering his prayer as a free and
   potent master among dreamers he had known that the great ones
   themselves are not beyond a mortals power to cope with and had
   trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos
   nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial
   moment as they had so often done before when men sought out earths
   gods in their home or on their mountains and with his hideous escort
   he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were knowing as
   he did that ghouls have no masters and that nightgaunts own not
   nyarlathotep but only archaic nodens for their lord but now he saw
   that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders
   and nameless sentinels and that the other gods are of a surety
   vigilant in guarding the mild feeble gods of earth void as they are
   of lordship over ghouls and nightgaunts the mindless shapeless
   blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must; so that
   it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that
   randolph carter came into the great ones throneroom with his ghouls
   swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars and dogged by
   unseen horrors of the northern waste all that army floated captive and
   helpless in the lurid light dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by
   some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved

   before no golden dais had randolph carter come nor was there any
   august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes longlobed
   ears thin nose and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on
   ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray save
   for the one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark and the
   masters were not there carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold
   waste but he had not found the gods yet still the lurid light glowed
   in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all
   outdoors and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight
   in thin curling mists earths gods were not there it was true but
   of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack where the
   mild gods are absent the other gods are not unrepresented; and
   certainly the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless in what
   outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could
   by no means imagine he felt that his visit had been expected and
   wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the
   crawling chaos nyarlathotep it is nyarlathotep horror of infinite
   shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods that the fungous
   moonbeasts serve; and carter thought of the black galley that had
   vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike
   abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea

   reflecting upon these things he was staggering to his feet in the
   midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through
   that palelitten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon
   trumpet three times pealed that frightful brazen scream and when the
   echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw
   that he was alone whither why and how the ghouls and nightgaunts had
   been snatched from sight was not for him to divine he knew only that
   he was suddenly alone and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly
   around him were no powers of earths friendly dreamland presently from
   the chambers uttermost reaches a new sound came this too was a
   rhythmic trumpeting; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous
   blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts in this low fanfare
   echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream; exotic vistas of
   unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien
   cadence odours of incense came to match the golden notes; and overhead
   a great light dawned its colours changing in cycles unknown to earths
   spectrum and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic
   harmonies torches flared in the distance and the beat of drums
   throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy

   out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin
   columns of giant black slaves with loincloths of iridescent silk upon
   their heads were strapped vast helmetlike torches of glittering metal
   from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals
   in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into
   leering chimaeras while their left hands grasped long thin silver
   trumpets which they blew in turn armlets and anklets of gold they had
   and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its
   wearer to a sober gait that they were true black men of earths
   dreamland was at once apparent but it seemed less likely that their
   rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth ten feet from
   carter the columns stopped and as they did so each trumpet flew
   abruptly to its bearers thick lips wild and ecstatic was the blast
   that followed and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from
   dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice

   then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a
   tall slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh gay with
   prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with
   inherent light close up to carter strode that regal figure; whose
   proud carriage and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark
   god or fallen archangel and around whose eyes there lurked the languid
   sparkle of capricious humour it spoke and in its mellow tones there
   rippled the wild music of lethean streams

   randolph carter said the voice you have come to see the great ones
   whom it is unlawful for men to see watchers have spoken of this thing
   and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly
   to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the
   daemonsultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud

   when barzai the wise climbed hathegkia to see the greater ones dance
   and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned the other
   gods were there and they did what was expected zenig of aphorat
   sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste and his skull is now
   set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not name

   but you randolph carter have braved all things of earths dreamland
   and burn still with the flame of quest you came not as one curious
   but as one seeking his due nor have you failed ever in reverence
   toward the mild gods of earth yet have these gods kept you from the
   marvellous sunset city of your dreams and wholly through their own
   small covetousness; for verily they craved the weird loveliness of
   that which your fancy had fashioned and vowed that henceforward no
   other spot should be their abode

   they are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your
   marvellous city all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by
   day and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and
   watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades arched bridges and
   silverbasined fountains and wide streets with blossomladen urns and
   ivory statues in gleaming rows and when night comes they climb tall
   terraces in the dew and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the
   stars or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the towns steep
   northward slopes where one by one the little windows in old peaked
   gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles

   the gods love your marvellous city and walk no more in the ways of
   the gods they have forgotten the high places of earth and the
   mountains that knew their youth the earth has no longer any gods that
   are gods and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on
   unremembered kadath far away in a valley of your own childhood
   randolph carter play the heedless great ones you have dreamed too
   well o wise archdreamer for you have drawn dreams gods away from
   the world of all mens visions to that which is wholly yours; having
   builded out of your boyhoods small fancies a city more lovely than all
   the phantoms that have gone before

   it is not well that earths gods leave their thrones for the spider to
   spin on and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of
   others fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to
   you randolph carter who are the cause of their upsetting but that
   they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their
   world in that halfwaking dreamland which is yours no power of
   uttermost night may pursue; and only you can send the selfish great
   ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city back through the
   northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold
   waste

   so randolph carter in the name of the other gods i spare you and
   charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours and to send thence
   the drowsy truant gods for whom the dream world waits not hard to find
   is that roseal fever of the gods that fanfare of supernal trumpets and
   clash of immortal cymbals that mystery whose place and meaning have
   haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming and
   tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things
   awesome and momentous not hard to find is that symbol and relic of
   your days of wonder for truly it is but the stable and eternal gem
   wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening
   path behold! it is not over unknown seas but back over wellknown
   years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of
   infancy and the quick sundrenched glimpses of magic that old scenes
   brought to wide young eyes

   for know you that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum
   of what you have seen and loved in youth it is the glory of bostons
   hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset of the
   flowerfragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
   gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the manybridged charles
   flows drowsily these things you saw randolph carter when your nurse
   first wheeled you out in the springtime and they will be the last
   things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love and there is
   antique salem with its brooding years and spectral marblehead scaling
   its rocky precipices into past centuries! and the glory of salems
   towers and spires seen afar from marbleheads pastures across the
   harbour against the setting sun

   there is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue
   harbour with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of
   living antiquity and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming
   breakwater arkham is there with its mossgrown gambrel roofs and the
   rocky rolling meadows behind it; and antediluvian kingsport hoary with
   stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables and the
   marvel of high cliffs and the milkymisted ocean with tolling buoys
   beyond

   cool vales in concord cobbled lands in portsmouth twilight bends of
   rustic new hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse
   walls and creaking wellsweeps gloucesters salt wharves and truros
   windy willows vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills
   along the north shore hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in
   the lee of huge boulders in rhode islands back country scent of the
   sea and fragrance of the fields; spell of the dark woods and joy of the
   orchards and gardens at dawn these randolph carter are your city;
   for they are yourself new england bore you and into your soul she
   poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die this loveliness moulded
   crystallised and polished by years of memory and dreaming is your
   terraced wonder of elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet
   with curious urns and carven rail and descend at last these endless
   balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains
   you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful
   boyhood

   look! through that window shine the stars of eternal night even now
   they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished
   drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the
   gardens of dream there is antareshe is winking at this moment over
   the roofs of tremont street and you could see him from your window on
   beacon hill out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my
   mindless masters have sent me some day you too may traverse them but
   if you are wise you will beware such folly; for of those mortals who
   have been and returned only one preserves a mind unshattered by the
   pounding clawing horrors of the void terrors and blasphemies gnaw at
   one another for space and there is more evil in the lesser ones than
   in the greater; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to
   deliver you into my hands whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter
   you and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been
   elsewhere busyand certain that you would yourself find the way shun
   then the outer hells and stick to the calm lovely things of your
   youth seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant
   great ones sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their
   own youth and which wait uneasy for their return

   easier even then the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for
   you see! there comes hither a monstrous shantak led by a slave who
   for your peace of mind had best keep invisible mount and be
   readythere! yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror steer
   for that brightest star just south of the zenithit is vega and in
   two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city steer for
   it only till you hear a faroff singing in the high aether higher than
   that lurks madness so rein your shantak when the first note lures
   look then back to earth and you will see shining the deathless
   altarflame of irednaa from the sacred roof of a temple that temple
   is in your desiderate sunset city so steer for it before you heed the
   singing and are lost

   when you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of
   old you scanned the outspread glory prodding the shantak till he cry
   aloud that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their
   perfumed terraces and there will come upon them such a homesickness
   that all of your citys wonders will not console them for the absence
   of kadaths grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it

   then must you land amongst them with the shantak and let them see and
   touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird; meanwhile discoursing to
   them of unknown kadath which you will so lately have left and telling
   them how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted where of old
   they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance and the shantak will
   talk to them in the manner of shantaks but it will have no powers of
   persuasion beyond the recalling of elder days

   over and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home
   and youth till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the
   returning path they have forgotten thereat can you loose the waiting
   shantak sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind; hearing
   which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth and
   forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods through
   the deep gulfs of heaven to kadaths familiar towers and domes

   then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit
   for ever and once more will earths gods rule the dreams of men from
   their accustomed seat go nowthe casement is open and the stars await
   outside already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience
   steer for vega through the night but turn when the singing sounds
   forget not this warning lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the
   gulf of shrieking and ululant madness remember the other gods; they
   are great and mindless and terrible and lurk in the outer voids they
   are good gods to shun

   hei! aashanta nygh! you are off! send back earths gods to their
   haunts on unknown kadath and pray to all space that you may never meet
   me in my thousand other forms farewell randolph carter and beware;
   for i am nyarlathotep the crawling chaos

   and randolph carter gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak shot
   screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega;
   looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the
   onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window
   above the air and the clouds of earths dreamland great polypous
   horrors slid darkly past and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous
   around him but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly
   and hippocephalic scaled bird the stars danced mockingly almost
   shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder
   one had not seen and feared before; and ever the winds of nether howled
   of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos

   then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent
   and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away
   before the dawn trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made
   weirdly visible there rose a timid hint of faroff melody droning in
   faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not and as that
   music grew the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead and carter
   likewise bent to catch each lovely strain it was a song but not the
   song of any voice night and the spheres sang it and it was old when
   space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were born

   faster flew the shantak and lower bent the rider drunk with the
   marvel of strange gulfs and whirling in the crystal coils of outer
   magic then came too late the warning of the evil one the sardonic
   caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the
   madness of that song only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way
   to safety and the marvellous sunset city; only to mock had that black
   messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose steps he could
   so easily lead back at will for madness and the voids wild vengeance
   are nyarlathoteps only gifts to the presumptuous; and frantick though
   the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed that leering tittering
   shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless flapping its great
   slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits
   whither no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost
   confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinitys centre the
   mindless daemonsultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud

   unswerving and obedient to the foul legates orders that hellish bird
   plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in
   darkness and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped
   and groped and pawed; the nameless larvae of the other gods that are
   like them blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and
   thirsts

   onward unswerving and relentless and tittering hilariously to watch
   the chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the
   spheres had turned that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless
   rider; hurtling and shooting cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning
   the outermost abysses; leaving behind the stars and the realms of
   matter and darting meteorlike through stark formlessness toward those
   inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time wherein azathoth gnaws
   shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled maddening beat of vile drums
   and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes

   onwardonwardthrough the screaming cackling and blackly populous
   gulfsand then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and
   a thought to randolph carter the doomed too well had nyarlathotep
   planned his mocking and his tantalising for he had brought up that
   which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface homenew
   englandbeacon hillthe waking world

   for know you that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum
   of what you have seen and loved in youth the glory of bostons
   hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset; of the
   flowerfragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
   gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the manybridged charles
   flows drowsily this loveliness moulded crystallised and polished
   by years of memory and dreaming is your terraced wonder of elusive
   sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven
   rail and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city
   of broad squares and prismatic fountains you need only to turn back to
   the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood

   onwardonwarddizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness
   where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless
   things tittered and tittered and tittered but the image and the
   thought had come and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming
   and only dreaming and that somewhere in the background the world of
   waking and the city of his infancy still lay words came againyou
   need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful
   boyhood turnturnblackness on every side but randolph carter
   could turn

   thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses randolph
   carter could turn and move he could move and if he chose he could
   leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the
   orders of nyarlathotep he could leap off and dare those depths of
   night that yawned interminably down those depths of fear whose terrors
   yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos
   core he could turn and move and leaphe couldhe wouldhe wouldhe
   would

   off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate
   dreamer and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell
   aeons reeled universes died and were born again stars became nebulae
   and nebulae became stars and still randolph carter fell through those
   endless voids of sentient blackness

   then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the
   cosmos churned itself into another futile completion and all things
   became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before matter and light
   were born anew as space once had known them; and comets suns and
   worlds sprang flaming into life though nothing survived to tell that
   they had been and gone been and gone always and always back to no
   first beginning

   and there was a firmament again and a wind and a glare of purple
   light in the eyes of the falling dreamer there were gods and presences
   and wills; beauty and evil and the shrieking of noxious night robbed
   of its prey for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought
   and a vision of a dreamers boyhood and now there were remade a waking
   world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things
   out of the void sngac the violet gas had pointed the way and archaic
   nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps

   stars swelled to dawns and dawns burst into fountains of gold
   carmine and purple and still the dreamer fell cries rent the aether
   as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside and hoary nodens
   raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep close on his quarry
   stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless huntinghorrors to
   grey dust randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide
   marmoreal flights to his marvellous city for he was come again to the
   fair new england world that had wrought him

   so to the organ chords of mornings myriad whistles and dawns blaze
   thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the
   state house on the hill randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within
   his boston room birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of
   trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared
   beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and
   walls grotesquely figured while a sleek black cat rose yawning from
   hearthside sleep that his masters start and shriek had disturbed and
   vast infinities away past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted
   wood and the garden lands and the cerenarian sea and the twilight
   reaches of inquanok the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding
   into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste and taunted
   insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from
   their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city

   whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the
   dreams walter gilman did not know behind everything crouched the
   brooding festering horror of the ancient town and of the mouldy
   unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with
   figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed
   his ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable
   degree and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose
   ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery at night the
   subtle stirring of the black city outside the sinister scurrying of
   rats in the wormy partitions and the creaking of hidden timbers in the
   centuried house were enough to give him a sense of strident
   pandemonium the darkness always teemed with unexplained soundand yet
   he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside
   and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises which he suspected
   were lurking behind them

   he was in the changeless legendhaunted city of arkham with its
   clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches
   hid from the kings men in the dark olden years of the province nor
   was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable
   room which harboured himfor it was this house and this room which had
   likewise harboured old keziah mason whose flight from salem gaol at
   the last no one was ever able to explain that was in 1692the gaoler
   had gone mad and babbled of a small whitefanged furry thing which
   scuttled out of keziahs cell and not even cotton mather could explain
   the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red
   sticky fluid

   possibly gilman ought not to have studied so hard noneuclidean
   calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain and when
   one mixes them with folklore and tries to trace a strange background
   of multidimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the gothic
   tales and the wild whispers of the chimneycorner one can hardly
   expect to be wholly free from mental tension gilman came from
   haverhill but it was only after he had entered college in arkham that
   he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder
   magic something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his
   imagination the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up
   and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points moreover
   they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden
   secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university
   library but all these precautions came late in the day so that gilman
   had some terrible hints from the dreaded necronomicon of abdul
   alhazred the fragmentary book of eibon and the suppressed
   unaussprechlicken kulten of von junzt to correlate with his abstract
   formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known
   and unknown

   he knew his room was in the old witchhousethat indeed was why he
   had taken it there was much in the essex county records about keziah
   masons trial and what she had admitted under pressure to the court of
   oyer and terminer had fascinated gilman beyond all reason she had told
   judge hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out
   directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond
   and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at
   certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond
   meadow hill and on the unpeopled island in the river she had spoken
   also of the black man of her oath and of her new secret name of
   nahab then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and
   vanished

   gilman believed strange things about keziah and had felt a queer
   thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than
   two hundred and thirtyfive years when he heard the hushed arkham
   whispers about keziahs persistent presence in the old house and the
   narrow streets about the irregular human toothmarks left on certain
   sleepers in that and other houses about the childish cries heard near
   mayeve and hallowmass about the stench often noted in the old
   houses attic just after those dreaded seasons and about the small
   furry sharptoothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and
   the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn
   he resolved to live in the place at any cost a room was easy to
   secure for the house was unpopular hard to rent and long given over
   to cheap lodgings gilman could not have told what he expected to find
   there but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some
   circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of
   the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps
   beyond the utmost modern delvings of planck heisenberg einstein and
   de sitter

   he studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs
   at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled and within a week
   managed to get the eastern attic room where keziah was held to have
   practised her spells it had been vacant from the firstfor no one had
   ever been willing to stay there longbut the polish landlord had grown
   wary about renting it yet nothing whatever happened to gilman till
   about the time of the fever no ghostly keziah flitted through the
   sombre halls and chambers no small furry thing crept into his dismal
   eyrie to nuzzle him and no record of the witchs incantations rewarded
   his constant search sometimes he would take walks through shadowy
   tangles of unpaved mustysmelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of
   unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow
   smallpaned windows here he knew strange things had happened once and
   there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that
   monstrous past might notat least in the darkest narrowest and most
   intricately crooked alleyshave utterly perished he also rowed out
   twice to the illregarded island in the river and made a sketch of the
   singular angles described by the mossgrown rows of grey standing
   stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial

   gilmans room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north
   wall slating perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end while
   the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction aside
   from an obvious rathole and the signs of other stoppedup ones there
   was no accessnor any appearance of a former avenue of accessto the
   space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the
   straight outer wall on the houses north side though a view from the
   exterior showed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote
   date the loft above the ceilingwhich must have had a slanting
   floorwas likewise inaccessible when gilman climbed up a ladder to
   the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges
   of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking
   and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry no
   amount of persuasion however could induce the stolid landlord to let
   him investigate either of these two closed spaces

   as time wore along his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of
   his room increased; for he began to read into the odd angles a
   mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding
   their purpose old keziah he reflected might have had excellent
   reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles; for was it not
   through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the
   boundaries of the world of space we know? his interest gradually veered
   away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces since it
   now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he
   was on

   the touch of brainfever and the dreams began early in february for
   some time apparently the curious angles of gilmans room had been
   having a strange almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak
   winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at
   the corner where the downslanting ceiling met the inwardslanting
   wall about this period his inability to concentrate on his formal
   studies worried him considerably his apprehensions about the midyear
   examinations being very acute but the exaggerated sense of hearing was
   scarcely less annoying life had become an insistent and almost
   unendurable cacophony and there was that constant terrifying
   impression of other soundsperhaps from regions beyond lifetrembling
   on the very brink of audibility so far as concrete noises went the
   rats in the ancient partitions were the worst sometimes their
   scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate when it came from
   beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry
   rattling; and when it came from the centuryclosed loft above the
   slanting ceiling gilman always braced himself as if expecting some
   horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him
   utterly

   the dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity and gilman fell that
   they must be a result jointly of his studies in mathematics and in
   folklore he had been thinking too much about the vague regions which
   his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know and
   about the possibility that old keziah masonguided by some influence
   past all conjecturehad actually found the gate to those regions the
   yellowed country records containing her testimony and that of her
   accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human
   experienceand the descriptions of the darting little furry object
   which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their
   incredible details

   that objectno larger than a goodsized rat and quaintly called by the
   townspeople brown jenkinseemed to have been the fruit of a
   remarkable case of sympathetic herddelusion for in 1692 no less than
   eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it there were recent
   rumours too with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement
   witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat but that its
   sharptoothed bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like
   tiny human hands it took messages betwixt old keziah and the devil
   and was nursed on the witchs blood which it sucked like a vampire
   its voice was a kind of loathsome titter and it could speak all
   languages of all the bizarre monstrosities in gilmans dreams nothing
   filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and
   diminutive hybrid whose image flitted across his vision in a form a
   thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking mind had deduced
   from the ancient records and the modern whispers

   gilmans dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses
   of inexplicably coloured twilight and baffingly disordered sound;
   abysses whose material and gravitational properties and whose relation
   to his own entity he could not even begin to explain he did not walk
   or climb fly or swim crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode
   of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary of his own condition
   he could not well judge for sight of his arms legs and torso seemed
   always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective; but he felt
   that his physical organization and faculties were somehow marvellously
   transmuted and obliquely projectedthough not without a certain
   grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and properties

   the abysses were by no means vacant being crowded with indescribably
   angled masses of alienhued substance some of which appeared to be
   organic while others seemed inorganic a few of the organic objects
   tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind though he could
   form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested
   in the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into
   which the organic objects appeared to be divided and which seemed to
   involve in each case a radically different species of conductpattern
   and basic motivation of these categories one seemed to him to include
   objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than
   the members of the other categories

   all the objectsorganic and inorganic alikewere totally beyond
   description or even comprehension gilman sometimes compared the
   inorganic matter to prisms labyrinths clusters of cubes and planes
   and cyclopean buildings; and the organic things struck him variously as
   groups of bubbles octopi centipedes living hindoo idols and
   intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation
   everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and whenever
   one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him
   he felt a stark hideous fright which generally jolted him awake of
   how the organic entities moved he could tell no more than of how he
   moved himself in time he observed a further mysterythe tendency of
   certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space or to disappear
   totally with equal suddenness the shrieking roaring confusion of
   sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch
   timbre or rhythm; but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual
   changes in all the indefinite objects organic and inorganic alike
   gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some
   unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure
   relentlessly inevitable fluctuations

   but it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown
   jenkin that shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter
   sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the
   fullest depths of sleep he would be lying in the dark fighting to keep
   awake when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the
   centuried room showing in a violet mist the convergence of angled
   planes which had seized his brain so insidiously the horror would
   appear to pop out of the rathole in the corner and patter toward him
   over the sagging wideplanked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny
   bearded human face; but mercifully this dream always melted away
   before the object got close enough to nuzzle him it had hellishly
   long sharp canine teeth; gilman tried to stop up the rathole every
   day but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away
   the obstruction whatever it might be once he had the landlord nail a
   tin over it but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole in making
   which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little
   fragment of bone

   gilman did not report his fever to the doctor for he knew he could not
   pass the examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every
   moment was needed for cramming as it was he failed in calculus d and
   advanced general psychology though not without hope of making up lost
   ground before the end of the term

   it was in march when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary
   dreaming and the nightmare shape of brown jenkin began to be
   companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a
   bent old woman this addition disturbed him more than he could account
   for but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he
   had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the
   abandoned wharves on those occasions the evil sardonic and seemingly
   unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost
   shiveringespecially the first time when an overgrown rat darting
   across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think
   irrationally of brown jenkin now he reflected those nervous fears
   were being mirrored in his disordered dreams that the influence of the
   old house was unwholesome he could not deny but traces of his early
   morbid interest still held him there he argued that the fever alone
   was responsible for his nightly fantasies and that when the touch
   abated he would be free from the monstrous visions those visions
   however were of absorbing vividness and convincingness and whenever
   he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than
   he remembered he was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had
   talked with both brown jenkin and the old woman and that they had been
   urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of
   greater potency

   toward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics though
   the other studies bothered him increasingly he was getting an
   intuitive knack for solving riemannian equations and astonished
   professor upham by his comprehension of fourthdimensional and other
   problems which had floored all the rest of the class one afternoon
   there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space and of
   theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the
   cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or
   the transgalactic gulfs themselvesor even as fabulously remote as the
   tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian
   spacetime continuum gilmans handling of this theme filled everyone
   with admiration even though some of his hypothetical illustrations
   caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and
   solitary eccentricity what made the students shake their heads was his
   sober theory that a man mightgiven mathematical knowledge admittedly
   beyond all likelihood of human acquirementstep deliberately from the
   earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity
   of specific points in the cosmic pattern

   such a step he said would require only two stages; first a passage
   out of the threedimensional sphere we know and second a passage back
   to the threedimensional sphere at another point perhaps one of
   infinite remoteness that this could be accomplished without loss of
   life was in many cases conceivable any being from any part of
   threedimensional space could probably survive in the fourth dimension;
   and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part
   of threedimensional space it might select for its reentry denizens
   of some planets might be able to live on certain otherseven planets
   belonging to other galaxies or to similar dimensional phases of other
   spacetime continuathough of course there must be vast numbers of
   mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or
   zones of space

   it was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm
   could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of
   additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensionsbe they within or
   outside the given spacetime continuumand that the converse would be
   likewise true this was a matter for speculation though one could be
   fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any
   given dimensional plane to the next higher one would not be destructive
   of biological integrity as we understand it gilman could not be very
   clear about his reasons for this last assumption but his haziness here
   was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points
   professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of
   higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down
   the ages from an ineffable antiquityhuman or prehumanwhose
   knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours

   around 1 april gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did
   not abate he was also troubled by what some of his fellow lodgers said
   about his sleepwalking it seemed that he was often absent from his
   bed and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night
   was remarked by the man in the room below this fellow also spoke of
   hearing the tread of shod feet in the night; but gilman was sure he
   must have been mistaken in this since shoes as well as other apparel
   were always precisely in place in the morning one could develop all
   sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old housefor did not gilman
   himself even in daylight now feel certain that noises other than
   ratscratching came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and
   above the slanting ceiling? his pathologically sensitive ears began to
   listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead
   and sometimes the illusion of such things was agonizingly realistic

   however he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist; for twice
   at night his room had been found vacant though with all his clothing
   in place of this he had been assured by frank elwood the one
   fellowstudent whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and
   unpopular house elwood had been studying in the small hours and had
   come up for help on a differential equation only to find gilman
   absent it had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked
   door after knocking had failed to rouse a response but he had needed
   the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle
   prodding awake on neither occasion though had gilman been there; and
   when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering
   barefoot and with only his night clothes on he resolved to investigate
   the matter if reports of his sleepwalking continued and thought of
   sprinkling flour on the floor of the corridor to see where his
   footsteps might lead the door was the only conceivable egress for
   there was no possible foothold outside the narrow window

   as april advanced gilmans feversharpened ears were disturbed by the
   whining prayers of a superstitious loomfixer named joe mazurewicz who
   had a room on the ground floor mazurewicz had told long rambling
   stories about the ghost of old keziah and the furry sharpfanged
   nuzzling thing and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only
   his silver crucifixgiven him for the purpose by father iwanicki of
   st stanislaus churchcould bring him relief now he was praying
   because the witches sabbath was drawing near may eve was walpurgis
   night when hells blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of
   satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds it was always a very bad
   time in arkham even though the fine folks up in miskatonic avenue and
   high and saltonstall streets pretended to know nothing about it there
   would be bad doings and a child or two would probably be missing joe
   knew about such things for his grandmother in the old country had
   heard tales from her grandmother it was wise to pray and count ones
   beads at this season for three months keziah and brown jenkin had not
   been near joes room nor near paul choynskis room nor anywhere
   elseand it meant no good when they held off like that they must be
   up to something

   gilman dropped in at the doctors office on the sixteenth of the month
   and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had
   feared the physician questioned him sharply and advised him to see a
   nerve specialist on reflection he was glad he had not consulted the
   still more inquisitive college doctor old waldron who had curtailed
   his activities before would have made him take a restan impossible
   thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations he
   was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the
   fourth dimension and who could say how much farther he might go?

   but even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his
   strange confidence did all of this perilous sense of imminence come
   from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day? the soft
   stealthy imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving
   and now too there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly
   persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do how
   about the somnambulism? where did he go sometimes in the night? and
   what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while seemed to
   trickle through the confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad
   daylight and full wakefulness? its rhythm did not correspond to
   anything on earth unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two
   unmentionable sabbatchants and sometimes he feared it corresponded to
   certain attributes of the vague shrieking or roaring in those wholly
   alien abysses of dream

   the dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious in the lighter
   preliminary phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness
   and gilman knew she was the one who had frightened him in the slums
   her bent back long nose and shrivelled chin were unmistakable and
   her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered the
   expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation
   and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and
   threatened he must meet the black man and go with them all to the
   throne of azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos that was what she
   said he must sign the book of azathoth in his own blood and take a new
   secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far what
   kept him from going with her and brown jenkin and the other to the
   throne of chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that
   he had seen the name azathoth in the necronomicon and knew it stood
   for a primal evil too horrible for description

   the old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the
   downward slant met the inward slant she seemed to crystallize at a
   point closer to the ceiling than to the floor and every night she was
   a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted brown
   jenkin too was always a little nearer at the last and its
   yellowishwhite fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet
   phosphorescence its shrill loathsome tittering struck more and more
   into gilmans head and he could remember in the morning how it had
   pronounced the words azathoth and nyarlathotep

   in the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct and gilman
   felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth
   dimension those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly
   irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of lifeforms from
   our own planet including human beings what the others were in their
   own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think two of the
   less irrelevantly moving thingsa rather large congeries of
   iridescent prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller
   polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface
   anglesseemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float
   ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms labyrinths
   cubeandplane clusters and quasibuildings; and all the while the
   vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder as if approaching
   some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensity

   during the night of 1920 april the new development occurred gilman
   was half involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the
   bubblemass and the small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the
   peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic
   neighbouring prismclusters in another second he was out of the abyss
   and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense
   diffused green light he was barefooted and in his nightclothes and
   when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet
   a swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from
   sight and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge
   out of that vapour

   then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward himthe old
   woman and the little furry thing the crone strained up to her knees
   and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion while brown jenkin
   pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid forepaw which
   it raised with evident difficulty spurred by an impulse he did not
   originate gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by
   the angle of the old womans arms and the direction of the small
   monstrositys paw and before he had shuffled three steps he was back
   in the twilight abysses geometrical shapes seethed around him and he
   fell dizzily and interminably at last he woke in his bed in the
   crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house

   he was good for nothing that morning and stayed away from all his
   classes some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly
   irrelevant direction for he could not help staring at a certain vacant
   spot on the floor as the day advanced the focus of his unseeing eyes
   changed position and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at
   vacancy about two oclock he went out for lunch and as he threaded the
   narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the
   southeast only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street
   and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly

   he would have to consult a nerve specialist after allperhaps there
   was a connection with his somnambulismbut meanwhile he might at least
   try to break the morbid spell himself undoubtedly he could still
   manage to walk away from the pull so with great resolution he headed
   against it and dragged himself deliberately north along garrison
   street by the time he had reached the bridge over the miskatonic he
   was in a cold perspiration and he clutched at the iron railing as he
   gazed upstream at the illregarded island whose regular lines of
   ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlight

   then he gave a start for there was a clearly visible living figure on
   that desolate island and a second glance told him it was certainly the
   strange old woman whose sinister aspect had worked itself so
   disastrously into his dreams the tall grass near her was moving too
   as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground when
   the old woman began to turn toward him he fled precipitately off the
   bridge and into the shelter of the towns labyrinthine waterfront
   alleys distant though the island was he felt that a monstrous and
   invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent
   ancient figure in brown

   the southeastwards pull still held and only with tremendous resolution
   could gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs
   for hours he sat silent and aimless with his eyes shifting gradually
   westward about six oclock his sharpened ears caught the whining
   prayers of joe mazurewicz two floors below and in desperation he
   seized his hat and walked out into the sunsetgolden streets letting
   the now directly southward pull carry him where it might an hour later
   darkness found him in the open fields beyond hangmans brook with the
   glimmering spring stars shining ahead the urge to walk was gradually
   changing to an urge to leap mystically into space and suddenly he
   realized just where the source of the pull lay

   it was in the sky a definite point among the stars had a claim on him
   and was calling him apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra
   and argo navis and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since
   he had awaked soon after dawn in the morning it had been underfoot
   and now it was roughly south but stealing toward the west what was the
   meaning of this new thing? was he going mad? how long would it last?
   again mustering his resolution gilman turned and dragged himself back
   to the sinister old house

   mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door and seemed both anxious and
   reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition it was about the
   witchlight joe had been out celebrating the night beforeand it was
   patriots day in massachusettsand had come home after midnight
   looking up at the house from outside he had thought at first that
   gilmans window was dark but then he had seen the faint violet glow
   within he wanted to warn the gentleman about that glow for everybody
   in arkham knew it was keziahs witchlight which played near brown
   jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself he had not mentioned
   this before but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah
   and her longtoothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman
   sometimes he and paul choynski and landlord dombrowski thought they saw
   that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young
   gentlemans room but they had all agreed not to talk about that
   however it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and
   get a crucifix from some good priest like father iwanicki

   as the man rambled on gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his
   throat he knew that joe must have been half drunk when he came home
   the night before; yet the mention of a violet light in the garret
   window was of frightful import it was a lambent glow of this sort
   which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in
   those lighter sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown
   abysses and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the
   dreamluminance was utterly beyond sane harborage yet where had the
   fellow got such an odd notion? had he himself talked as well as walked
   around the house in his sleep? no joe said he had notbut he must
   check up on this perhaps frank elwood could tell him something though
   he hated to ask

   feverwild dreamssomnambulismillusions of soundsa pull toward a
   point in the skyand now a suspicion of insane sleeptalking! he must
   stop studying see a nerve specialist and take himself in hand when
   he climbed to the second storey he paused at elwoods door but saw that
   the other youth was out reluctantly he continued up to his garret room
   and sat down in the dark his gaze was still pulled to the southward
   but he also found himself listening intently for some sound in the
   closed loft above and half imagining that an evil violet light seeped
   down through an infinitesimal crack in the low slanting ceiling

   that night as gilman slept the violet light broke upon him with
   heightened intensity and the old witch and small furry thing getting
   closer than ever before mocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish
   gestures he was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight
   abysses though the pursuit of that iridescent bubblecongeries and
   that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and irritating then
   came the shift as vast converging planes of a slipperylooking
   substance loomed above and below hima shift which ended in a flash of
   delirium and a blaze of unknown alien light in which yellow carmine
   and indigo were madly and inextricably blended

   he was half lying on a high fantastically balustraded terrace above a
   boundless jungle of outlandish incredible peaks balanced planes
   domes minarets horizontal disks poised on pinnacles and numberless
   forms of still greater wildnesssome of stone and some of metalwhich
   glittered gorgeously in the mixed almost blistering glare from a
   polychromatic sky looking upward he saw three stupendous disks of
   flame each of a different hue and at a different height above an
   infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains behind him tiers
   of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see the city below
   stretched away to the limits of vision and he hoped that no sound
   would well up from it

   the pavement from which he easily raised himself was a veined polished
   stone beyond his power to identify and the tiles were cut in
   bizarreangled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based
   on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend the
   balustrade was chesthigh delicate and fantastically wrought while
   along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of
   grotesque design and exquisite workmanship they like the whole
   balustrade seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose
   colour could not be guessed in the chaos of mixed effulgences and
   their nature utterly defied conjecture they represented some ridged
   barrelshaped objects with thin horizontal arms radiating spokelike
   from a central ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from
   the head and base of the barrel each of these knobs was the hub of a
   system of five long flat triangularly tapering arms arranged around
   it like the arms of a starfishnearly horizontal but curving slightly
   away from the central barrel the base of the bottom knob was fused to
   the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several
   figures had been broken off and were missing the figures were about
   four and a half inches in height while the spiky arms gave them a
   maximum diameter of about two and a half inches

   when gilman stood up the tiles felt hot to his bare feet he was
   wholly alone and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look
   dizzily down at the endless cyclopean city almost two thousand feet
   below as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical
   pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets
   beneath and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place the
   sight turned him giddy after a while so that he would have fallen to
   the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous
   balustrade his right hand fell on one of the projecting figures the
   touch seeming to steady him slightly it was too much however for the
   exotic delicacy of the metalwork and the spiky figure snapped off
   under his grasp still half dazed he continued to clutch it as his
   other hand seized a vacant space on the smooth railing

   but now his oversensitive ears caught something behind him and he
   looked back across the level terrace approaching him softly though
   without apparent furtiveness were five figures two of which were the
   sinister old woman and the fanged furry little animal the other three
   were what sent him unconscious; for they were living entities about
   eight feet high shaped precisely like the spiky images on the
   balustrade and propelling themselves by a spiderlike wriggling of
   their lower set of starfisharms

   gilman awoke in his bed drenched by a cold perspiration and with a
   smarting sensation in his face hands and feet springing to the floor
   he washed and dressed in frantic haste as if it were necessary for him
   to get out of the house as quickly as possible he did not know where
   he wished to go but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his
   classes the odd pull toward that spot in the sky between hydra and
   argo had abated but another of even greater strength had taken its
   place now he felt that he must go northinfinitely north he dreaded
   to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the
   miskatonic so went over the peabody avenue bridge very often he
   stumbled for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty
   point in the blank blue sky

   after about an hour he got himself under better control and saw that
   he was far from the city all around him stretched the bleak emptiness
   of salt marshes while the narrow road ahead led to innsmouththat
   ancient halfdeserted town which arkham people were so curiously
   unwilling to visit though the northward pull had not diminished he
   resisted it as he had resisted the other pull and finally found that
   he could almost balance the one against the other plodding back to
   town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain he dragged himself
   into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter
   magazines once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he
   looked but he did not tell them of his walk at three oclock he took
   some lunch at a restaurant noting meanwhile that the pull had either
   lessened or divided itself after that he killed the time at a cheap
   cinema show seeing the inane performance over and over again without
   paying any attention to it

   about nine at night he drifted homeward and shuffled into the ancient
   house joe mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers and gilman
   hastened up to his own garret chamber without pausing to see if elwood
   was in it was when he turned on the feeble electric light that the
   shock came at once he saw there was something on the table which did
   not belong there and a second look left no room for doubt lying on
   its sidefor it could not stand up alonewas the exotic spiky figure
   which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic
   balustrade no detail was missing the ridged barrelshaped center
   the thin radiating arms the knobs at each end and the flat slightly
   outwardcurving starfisharms spreading from those knobsall were
   there in the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of
   iridescent grey veined with green; and gilman could see amidst his
   horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break
   corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dreamrailing

   only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming
   aloud this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear still
   dazed he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to
   landlord dombrowskis quarters the whining prayers of the
   superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls
   but gilman did not mind them now the landlord was in and greeted him
   pleasantly no he had not seen that thing before and did not know
   anything about it but his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in
   one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon and maybe that was
   it dombrowski called her and she waddled in yes that was the thing
   she had found it in the young gentlemans bedon the side next the
   wall it had looked very queer to her but of course the young
   gentleman had lots of queer things in his roombooks and curios and
   pictures and markings on paper she certainly knew nothing about it

   so gilman climbed upstairs again in mental turmoil convinced that he
   was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to
   incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places
   where had he got this outré thing? he did not recall seeing it in any
   museum in arkham it must have been somewhere though; and the sight of
   it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd
   dreampicture of the balustraded terrace next day he would make some
   very guarded inquiriesand perhaps see the nerve specialist

   meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism as he went
   upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which
   he had borrowedwith a frank admission as to its purposefrom the
   landlord he had stopped at elwoods door on the way but had found all
   dark within entering his room he placed the spiky thing on the table
   and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing
   to undress from the closed loft above the slating ceiling he thought
   he heard a faint scratching and padding but he was too disorganized
   even to mind it that cryptical pull from the north was getting very
   strong again though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the
   sky

   in the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged
   furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any
   former occasion this time they actually reached him and he felt the
   crones withered claws clutching at him he was pulled out of bed and
   into empty space and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw
   the twilight amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him
   but that moment was very brief for presently he was in a crude
   windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a peak
   just above his head and with a curious slanting floor underfoot
   propped level on that floor were low cases full of books of every
   degree of antiquity and disintegration and in the centre were a table
   and bench both apparently fastened in place small objects of unknown
   shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases and in the
   flaming violet light gilman thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky
   image which had puzzled him so horribly on the left the floor fell
   abruptly away leaving a black triangular gulf out of which after a
   seconds dry rattling there presently climbed the hateful little furry
   thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human face

   the evillygrinning beldame still clutched him and beyond the table
   stood a figure he had never seen beforea tall lean man of dead black
   colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features: wholly
   devoid of either hair or beard and wearing as his only garment a
   shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric his feet were
   indistinguishable because of the table and bench but he must have been
   shod since there was a clicking whenever he changed position the man
   did not speak and bore no trace of expression on his small regular
   features he merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open
   on the table while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into gilmans
   right hand over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear and
   the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamers
   clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm finally biting
   him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff as the blood spurted from
   this wound gilman lapsed into a faint

   he awaked on the morning of the twentysecond with a pain in his left
   wrist and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood his
   recollections were very confused but the scene with the black man in
   the unknown space stood out vividly the rats must have bitten him as
   he slept giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream opening
   the door he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed
   except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the
   other end of the garret so he had not been sleepwalking this time
   but something would have to be done about those rats he would speak to
   the landlord about them again he tried to stop up the hole at the base
   of the slanting wall wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about
   the right size his ears were ringing horribly as if with the residual
   echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams

   as he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed
   after the scene in the violetlitten space but nothing definite would
   crystallize in his mind that scene itself must have corresponded to
   the sealed loft overhead which had begun to attack his imagination so
   violently but later impressions were faint and hazy there were
   suggestions of the vague twilight abysses and of still vaster
   blacker abysses beyond themabysses in which all fixed suggestions
   were absent he had been taken there by the bubblecongeries and the
   little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they like himself had
   changed to wisps of mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness
   something else had gone on aheada larger wisp which now and then
   condensed into nameless approximations of formand he thought that
   their progress had not been in a straight line but rather along the
   alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws
   unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos
   eventually there had been a hint of vast leaping shadows of a
   monstrous halfacoustic pulsing and of the thin monotonous piping of
   an unseen flutebut that was all gilman decided he had picked up that
   last conception from what he had read in the necronomicon about the
   mindless entity azathoth which rules all time and space from a black
   throne at the centre of chaos

   when the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight and
   gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures it occurred
   to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had
   lainwhich was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and
   cuff had he been sleepwalking within his room and had the rat bitten
   him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position?
   he looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains but did not
   find any he had better he thought spinkle flour within the room as
   well as outside the doorthough after all no further proof of his
   sleepwalking was needed he knew he did walk and the thing to do now
   was to stop it he must ask frank elwood for help this morning the
   strange pulls from space seemed lessened though they were replaced by
   another sensation even more inexplicable it was a vague insistent
   impulse to fly away from his present situation but held not a hint of
   the specific direction in which he wished to fly as he picked up the
   strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull
   grew a trifle stronger; but even so it was wholly overruled by the
   newer and more bewildering urge

   he took the spiky image down to elwoods room steeling himself against
   the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor
   elwood was in thank heaven and appeared to be stirring about there
   was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and
   college so gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent
   dreams and fears his host was very sympathetic and agreed that
   something ought to be done he was shocked by his guests drawn
   haggard aspect and noticed the queer abnormallooking sunburn which
   others had remarked during the past week

   there was not much though that he could say he had not seen gilman
   on any sleepwalking expedition and had no idea what the curious image
   could be he had though heard the frenchcanadian who lodged just
   under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening they were telling each
   other how badly they dreaded the coming of walpurgis night now only a
   few days off; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor
   doomed young gentleman desrochers the fellow under gilmans room had
   spoken of nocturnal footsteps shod and unshod and of the violet light
   he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through
   gilmans keyhole he had not dared to peer he told mazurewicz after
   he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door there
   had been soft talking tooand as he began to describe it his voice
   had sunk to an inaudible whisper

   elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures
   gossiping but supposed their imaginations had been roused by gilmans
   late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand and by
   the nearness of traditionallyfeared may eve on the other hand that
   gilman talked in his sleep was plain and it was obviously from
   desrochers keyhole listenings that the delusive notion of the violet
   dreamlight had got abroad these simple people were quick to imagine
   they had seen any odd thing they had heard about as for a plan of
   actiongilman had better move down to elwoods room and avoid sleeping
   alone elwood would if awake rouse him whenever he began to talk or
   rise in his sleep very soon too he must see the specialist
   meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums
   and to certain professors; seeking identification and stating that it
   had been found in a public rubbishcan also dombrowski must attend to
   the poisoning of those rats in the walls

   braced up by elwoods companionship gilman attended classes that day
   strange urges still tugged at him but he could sidetrack them with
   considerable success during a free period he showed the queer image to
   several professors all of whom were intensely interested though none
   of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin that night he
   slept on a couch which elwood had had the landlord bring to the
   secondstorey room and for the first time in weeks was wholly free
   from disquieting dreams but the feverishness still hung on and the
   whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influence

   during the next few days gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from
   morbid manifestations he had elwood said showed no tendency to talk
   or rise in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting ratpoison
   everywhere the only disturbing element was the talk among the
   superstitious foreigners whose imaginations had become highly excited
   mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix and finally
   forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good father
   iwanicki desrochers too had something to say; in fact he insisted
   that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the
   first and second nights of gilinans absence from it paul choynski
   thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night and
   claimed that his door had been softly tried while mrs dombrowski
   vowed she had seen brown jenkin for the first time since allhallows
   but such naïve reports could mean very little and gilman let the cheap
   metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his hosts dresser

   for three days gilman and elwood canvassed the local museums in an
   effort to identify the strange spiky image but always without success
   in every quarter however interest was intense; for the utter alienage
   of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity one of
   the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical
   analysis professor ellery found platinum iron and tellurium in the
   strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent
   elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless
   to classify not only did they fail to correspond with any known
   element but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for
   probable elements in the periodic system the mystery remains unsolved
   to this day though the image is on exhibition at the museum of
   miskatonic university

   on the morning of april twentyseventh a fresh rathole appeared in the
   room where gilman was a guest but dombrowski tinned it up during the
   day the poison was not having much effect for scratchings and
   scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished

   elwood was out late that night and gilman waited up for him he did
   not wish to go to sleep in a room aloneespecially since he thought he
   had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose
   image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams he wondered who
   she was and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a
   rubbishheap at the mouth of a squalid courtyard the crone had seemed
   to notice him and leer evilly at himthough perhaps this was merely
   his imagination

   the next day both youths felt very tired and knew they would sleep
   like logs when night came in the evening they drowsily discussed the
   mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully
   engrossed gilman and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic
   and folklore which seemed so darkly probable they spoke of old keziah
   mason and elwood agreed that gilman had good scientific grounds for
   thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant
   information the hidden cults to which these witches belonged often
   guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder forgotten eons;
   and it was by no means impossible that keziah had actually mastered the
   art of passing through dimensional gates tradition emphasizes the
   uselessness of material barriers in halting a witchs notions and who
   can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the
   night?

   whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from
   mathematical research alone was still to be seen success gilman
   added might lead to dangerous and unthinkable situations for who
   could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally
   inaccessible dimension? on the other hand the picturesque
   possibilities were enormous time could not exist in certain belts of
   space and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve
   ones life and age indefinitely; never suffering organic metabolism or
   deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to ones
   own or similar planes one might for example pass into a timeless
   dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earths history as
   young as before

   whether anybody had ever managed to do this one could hardly
   conjecture with any degree of authority old legends are hazy and
   ambiguous and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden
   gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and
   messengers from outside there was the immemorial figure of the deputy
   or messenger of hidden and terrible powersthe black man of the
   witchcult and the nyarlathotep of the necronomicon there was too
   the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediariesthe
   quasianimals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches
   familiars as gilman and elwood retired too sleepy to argue further
   they heard joe mazurewicz reel into the house half drunk and shuddered
   at the desperate wildness of his whining prayers

   that night gilman saw the violet light again in his dream he had heard
   a scratching and gnawing in the partitions and thought that someone
   fumbled clumsily at the latch then he saw the old woman and the small
   furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor the beldames
   face was alight with inhuman exultation and the little yellowtoothed
   morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavilysleeping form
   of elwood on the other couch across the room a paralysis of fear
   stifled all attempts to cry out as once before the hideous crone
   seized gilman by the shoulders yanking him out of bed and into empty
   space again the infinitude of the shrieking abysses flashed past him
   but in another second he thought he was in a dark muddy unknown alley
   of foetid odors with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on
   every hand

   ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the
   other dream while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning
   and grimacing imperiously brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind
   of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man which
   the deep mud largely concealed there was a dark open doorway on the
   right to which the black man silently pointed into this the grinning
   crone started dragging gilman after her by his pajama sleeves there
   were evilsmelling staircases which creaked ominously and on which the
   old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light; and finally a door
   leading off a landing the crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the
   door open motioning to gilman to wait and disappearing inside the
   black aperture

   the youths oversensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry and
   presently the beldame came out of the room bearing a small senseless
   form which she thrust at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it
   the sight of this form and the expression on its face broke the
   spell still too dazed to cry out he plunged recklessly down the
   noisome staircase and into the mud outside halting only when seized
   and choked by the waiting black man as consciousness departed he heard
   the faint shrill tittering of the fanged ratlike abnormality

   on the morning of the twentyninth gilman awaked into a maelstrom of
   horror the instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly
   wrong for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall
   and ceiling sprawled on the now unmade bed his throat was aching
   inexplicably and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with
   growing fright that his feet and pajama bottoms were brown with caked
   mud for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy but he knew
   at least that he must have been sleepwalking elwood had been lost too
   deeply in slumber to hear and stop him on the floor were confused
   muddy prints but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the
   door the more gilman looked at them the more peculiar they seemed;
   for in addition to those he could recognize as his there were some
   smaller almost round markingssuch as the legs of a large chair or a
   table might make except that most of them tended to be divided into
   halves there were also some curious muddy rattracks leading out of a
   fresh hole and back into it again utter bewilderment and the fear of
   madness racked gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there
   were no muddy prints outside the more he remembered of his hideous
   dream the more terrified he felt and it added to his desperation to
   hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below

   descending to elwoods room he roused his stillsleeping host and began
   telling of how he had found himself but elwood could form no idea of
   what might really have happened where gilman could have been how he
   got back to his room without making tracks in the hall and how the
   muddy furniturelike prints came to be mixed with his in the garret
   chamber were wholly beyond conjecture then there were those dark
   livid marks on his throat as if he had tried to strangle himself he
   put his hands up to them but found that they did not even
   approximately fit while they were talking desrochers dropped in to
   say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small
   hours no there had been no one on the stairs after midnight though
   just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret and
   cautiously descending steps he did not like it was he added a very
   bad time of year for arkham the young gentleman had better be sure to
   wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him even the daytime was
   not safe for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the
   houseespecially a thin childish wail hastily choked off

   gilman mechanically attended classes that morning but was wholly
   unable to fix his mind on his studies a mood of hideous apprehension
   and expectancy had seized him and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of
   some annihilating blow at noon he lunched at the university spa
   picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert but he
   never ate that dessert; for an item on the papers first page left him
   limp wildeyed and able only to pay his check and stagger back to
   elwoods room

   there had been a strange kidnapping the night before in ornes gangway
   and the twoyearold child of a clodlike laundry worker named
   anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight the mother it
   appeared had feared the event for some time; but the reasons she
   assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them
   seriously she had she said seen brown jenkin about the place now and
   then ever since early in march and knew from its grimaces and
   titterings that little ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the
   awful sabbat on walpurgis night she had asked her neighbour mary
   czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child but mary had
   not dared she could not tell the police for they never believed such
   things children had been taken that way every year ever since she
   could remember and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he
   wanted the child out of the way

   but what threw gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair
   of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just
   after midnight they admitted they had been drunk but both vowed they
   had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway
   there had they said been a huge robed negro a little old woman in
   rags and a young white man in his nightclothes the old woman had
   been dragging the youth while around the feet of the negro a tame rat
   was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud

   gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon and elwoodwho had meanwhile
   seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from themfound him
   thus when he came home this time neither could doubt but that
   something hideously serious was closing in around them between the
   phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a
   monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallizing and only
   stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments
   gilman must see a specialist sooner or later but not just now when
   all the papers were full of this kidnapping business

   just what had really happened was maddeningly obscure and for a moment
   both gilman and elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest
   kind had gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his
   studies of space and its dimensions? had he actually slipped outside
   our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable? whereif
   anywherehad he been on those nights of demoniac alienage? the roaring
   twilight abyssesthe green hillsidethe blistering terracethe pulls
   from the starsthe ultimate black vortexthe black manthe muddy
   alley and the stairsthe old witch and the fanged furry horrorthe
   bubblecongeries and the little polyhedronthe strange sunburnthe
   wristwoundthe unexplained imagethe muddy feetthe throat
   marksthe tales and fears of the superstitious foreignerswhat did
   all this mean? to what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a
   case?

   there was no sleep for either of them that night but next day they
   both cut classes and drowsed this was april thirtieth and with the
   dusk would come the hellish sabbattime which all the foreigners and
   the superstitious old folk feared mazurewicz came home at six oclock
   and said people at the mill were whispering that the walpurgis revels
   would be held in the dark ravine beyond meadow hill where the old white
   stone stands in a place queerly devoid of all plantlife some of them
   had even told the police and advised them to look there for the missing
   wolejko child but they did not believe anything would be done joe
   insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his nickelchained
   crucifix and gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to
   humour the fellow

   late at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs lulled by
   the praying of the loomfixer on the floor below gilman listened as he
   nodded his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for
   some subtle dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house
   unwholesome recollections of things in the necronomicon and the black
   book welled up and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said
   to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an
   origin outside the time and space we comprehend

   presently he realized what he was listening forthe hellish chant of
   the celebrants in the distant black valley how did he know so much
   about what they expected? how did he know the time when nahab and her
   acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black
   cock and the black goat? he saw that elwood had dropped asleep and
   tried to call out and waken him something however closed his throat
   he was not his own master had he signed the black mans book after
   all?

   then his fevered abnormal hearing caught the distant windborne notes
   over miles of hill and field and alley they came but he recognized
   them none the less the fires must be lit and the dancers must be
   starting in how could he keep himself from going? what was it that had
   enmeshed him? mathematicsfolklorethe houseold keziahbrown
   jenkin  and now he saw that there was a fresh rathole in the wall
   near his couch above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of
   joe mazurewicz came another sounda stealthy determined scratching in
   the partitions he hoped the electric lights would not go out then he
   saw the fanged bearded little face in the ratholethe accursed
   little face which he at last realized bore such a shocking mocking
   resemblance to old keziahsand heard the faint fumbling at the door

   the screaming twilight abysses flashed before him and he felt himself
   helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubblecongeries
   ahead raced the small kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the
   churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague
   tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and
   unendurable climax he seemed to know what was comingthe monstrous
   burst of walpurgisrhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated
   all the primal ultimate spacetime seethings which lie behind the
   massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured
   reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give
   hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods

   but all this vanished in a second he was again in the cramped
   violetlitten peaked space with the slanting floor the low cases of
   ancient books the bench and table the queer objects and the
   triangular gulf at one side on the table lay a small white figurean
   infant boy unclothed and unconsciouswhile on the other side stood
   the monstrous leering old woman with a gleaming grotesquehafted
   knife in her right hand and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl
   covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral
   handles in her left she was intoning some croaking ritual in a
   language which gilman could not understand but which seemed like
   something guardedly quoted in the necronomicon

   as the scene grew clearer he saw the ancient crone bend forward and
   extend the empty bowl across the tableand unable to control his own
   emotions he reached far forward and took it in both hands noticing as
   he did so its comparative lightness at the same moment the disgusting
   form of brown jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular
   black gulf on his left the crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in
   a certain position while she raised the huge grotesque knife above the
   small white victim as high as her right hand could reach the fanged
   furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual while
   the witch croaked loathsome responses gilman felt a gnawing poignant
   abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis and the
   light metal bowl shook in his grasp a second later the downward motion
   of the knife broke the spell completely and he dropped the bowl with a
   resounding belllike clangour while his hands darted out frantically to
   stop the monstrous deed

   in an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the
   table and wrenched the knife from the old womans claws; sending it
   clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf in another
   instant however matters were reversed; for those murderous claws had
   locked themselves tightly around his own throat while the wrinkled
   face was twisted with insane fury he felt the chain of the cheap
   crucifix grinding into his neck and in his peril wondered how the
   sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature her strength
   was altogether superhuman but as she continued her choking he reached
   feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol snapping the chain
   and pulling it free

   at sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic and her grip
   relaxed long enough to give gilman a chance to break it entirely he
   pulled the steellike claws from his neck and would have dragged the
   beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh
   access of strength and closed in again this time he resolved to reply
   in kind and his own hands reached out for the creatures throat
   before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix
   twisted about her neck and a moment later he had tightened it enough
   to cut off her breath during her last struggle he felt something bite
   at his ankle and saw that brown jenkin had come to her aid with one
   savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard
   it whimper on some level far below

   whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know but he let her
   rest on the floor where she had fallen then as he turned away he saw
   on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his
   reason brown jenkin tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of
   demoniac dexterity had been busy while the witch was throttling him
   and his efforts had been in vain what he had prevented the knife from
   doing to the victims chest the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy
   had done to a wristand the bowl so lately on the floor stood full
   beside the small lifeless body

   in his dreamdelirium gilman heard the hellish alienrhythmed chant of
   the sabbat coming from an infinite distance and knew the black man
   must be there confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics
   and he believed his subconscious mind held the angles which he needed
   to guide him back to the normal world alone and unaided for the first
   time he felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own
   room but whether he could ever escape through the slanting floor or
   the longstooped egress he doubted greatly besides would not an
   escape from a dreamloft bring him merely into a dreamhousean
   abnormal projection of the actual place he sought? he was wholly
   bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his
   experiences

   the passage through the vague abysses would be frightful for the
   walpurgisrhythm would be vibrating and at last he would have to hear
   that hithertoveiled cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded even
   now he could detect a low monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected
   all too well at sabbattime it always mounted and reached through to
   the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites half the chants of
   the sabbat were patterned on this faintly overheard pulsing which no
   earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness gilman
   wondered too whether he could trust his instincts to take him back to
   the right part of space how could he be sure he would not land on that
   greenlitten hillside of a far planet on the tessellated terrace above
   the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the
   spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of chaos where reigns the
   mindless demonsultan azathoth?

   just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him
   in utter blackness the witchold keziahnahabthat must have meant
   her death and mixed with the distant chant of the sabbat and the
   whimpers of brown jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard another
   and wilder whine from unknown depths joe mazurewiczthe prayers
   against the crawling chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant
   shriekworlds of sardonic actuality impinging on vortices of febrile
   dreamiä! shubniggurath! the goat with a thousand young

   they found gilman on the floor of his queerlyangled old garret room
   long before dawn for the terrible cry had brought desrochers and
   choynski and dombrowski and mazurewicz at once and had even wakened
   the soundly sleeping elwood in his chair he was alive and with open
   staring eyes but seemed largely unconscious on his throat were the
   marks of murderous hands and on his left ankle was a distressing
   ratbite his clothing was badly rumpled and joes crucifix was
   missing elwood trembled afraid even to speculate what new form his
   friends sleepwalking had taken mazurewicz seemed half dazed because
   of a sign he said he had had in response to his prayers and he
   crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat
   sounded from beyond the slanting partition

   when the dreamer was settled on his couch in elwoods room they sent
   for doctor malkowskia local practitioner who would repeat no tales
   where they might prove embarrassingand he gave gilman two hypodermic
   injections which caused him to relax in something like natural
   drowsiness during the day the patient regained consciousness at times
   and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to elwood it was a painful
   process and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting
   fact

   gilmanwhose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal
   sensitivenesswas now stonedeaf doctor malkowski summoned again in
   haste told elwood that both eardrums were ruptured as if by the
   impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception or
   endurance how such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours
   without arousing all the miskatonic valley was more than the honest
   physician could say

   elwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper so that a fairly easy
   communication was maintained neither knew what to make of the whole
   chaotic business and decided it would be better if they thought as
   little as possible about it both though agreed that they must leave
   this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged
   evening papers spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a
   ravine beyond meadow hill just before dawn and mentioned that the
   white stone there was an object of agelong superstitious regard
   nobody had been caught but among the scattering fugitives had been
   glimpsed a huge negro in another column it was stated that no trace of
   the missing child ladislas wolejko had been found

   the crowning horror came that very night elwood will never forget it
   and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of
   the resulting nervous breakdown he had thought he heard rats in the
   partition all the evening but paid little attention to them then
   long after both he and gilman had retired the atrocious shrieking
   began elwood jumped up turned on the lights and rushed over to his
   guests couch the occupant was emitting sounds of veritably inhuman
   nature as if racked by some torment beyond description he was
   writhing under the bedclothes and a great stain was beginning to
   appear on the blankets

   elwood scarcely dared to touch him but gradually the screaming and
   writhing subsided by this time dombrowski choynski desrochers
   mazurewicz and the topfloor lodger were all crowding into the
   doorway and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for
   doctor malkowski everybody shrieked when a large ratlike form
   suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and
   scuttled across the floor to a fresh open hole close by when the
   doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers walter
   gilman was dead

   it would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed gilman
   there had been virtually a tunnel through his bodysomething had eaten
   his heart out dombrowski frantic at the failure of his ratpoisoning
   efforts cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had
   moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in
   walnut street the worst thing for a while was keeping joe mazurewicz
   quiet; for the brooding loomfixer would never stay sober and was
   constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible things

   it seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the
   crimson rattracks which led from gilmans couch to the nearby hole
   on the carpet they were very indistinct but a piece of open flooring
   intervened between the carpets edge and the baseboard there
   mazurewicz had found something monstrousor thought he had for no one
   else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the
   prints the tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the
   average prints of a rat but even choynski and desrochers would not
   admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands

   the house was never rented again as soon as dombrowski left it the
   pall of its final desolation began to descend for people shunned it
   both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid
   odour perhaps the exlandlords ratpoison had worked after all for
   not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance
   health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside
   the eastern garret room and agreed that the number of dead rats must
   be enormous they decided however that it was not worth their while
   to hew open and disinfect the longsealed spaces; for the foetor would
   soon be over and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious
   standards indeed there were always vague local tales of unexplained
   stenches upstairs in the witchhouse just after mayeve and hallowmass
   the neighbours acquiesced in the inertiabut the foetor none the less
   formed an additional count against the place toward the last the house
   was condemned as a habitation by the building inspector

   gilmans dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been
   explained elwood whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes
   almost maddening came back to college the next autumn and was
   graduated in the following june he found the spectral gossip of the
   town much disminished and it is indeed a fact thatnotwithstanding
   certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which
   lasted almost as long as that edifice itselfno fresh appearances
   either of old keziah or of brown jenkin have been muttered of since
   gilmans death it is rather fortunate that elwood was not in arkham in
   that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers
   about elder horrors of course he heard about the matter afterward and
   suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation; but even
   that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights
   would have been

   in march 1931 a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant
   witchhouse so that a chaos of crumbling bricks blackened mossgrown
   shingles and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and
   broke through the floor beneath the whole attic storey was choked with
   debris from above but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before
   the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure that ultimate step
   came in the following december and it was when gilmans old room was
   cleared out by reluctant apprehensive workmen that the gossip began

   among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting
   ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in
   the police later the police in turn called in the coroner and several
   professors from the university there were bonesbadly crushed and
   splintered but clearly recognizable as humanwhose manifestly modern
   date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only
   possible lurking place the low slantfloored loft overhead had
   supposedly been sealed from all human access the coroners physician
   decided that some belonged to a small child while certain
   othersfound mixed with shreds of rotten brownish clothbelonged to a
   rather undersized bent female of advanced years careful sifting of
   debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse
   as well as older ratbones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and
   then highly productive of controversy and reflection

   other objects found included the mangled fragments of many books and
   papers together with a yellowish dust left from the total
   disintegration of still older books and papers all without exception
   appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible
   forms; and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a
   mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones an even greater
   mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed archaic writing
   found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest
   age differences of at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred years
   to some though the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly
   inexplicable objectsobjects whose shapes materials types of
   workmanship and purposes baffle all conjecturefound scattered amidst
   the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury one of these
   thingswhich excited several miskatonic professors profoundlyis a
   badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which
   gilman gave to the college museum save that it is large wrought of
   some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal and possessed of a
   singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics

   archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the
   bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner
   side bore ominous brownish stains when found foreigners and credulous
   grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix
   with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by
   joe mazurewicz as that which he had given poor gilman many years
   before some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by
   rats while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner
   of gilmans old room at the time still others including joe himself
   have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence

   when the slanting wall of gilmans room was torn out the oncesealed
   triangular space between that partition and the houses north wall was
   found to contain much less structural debris even in proportion to its
   size than the room itself though it had a ghastly layer of older
   materials which paralyzed the wreckers with horror in brief the floor
   was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small childrensome fairly
   modern but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so
   remote that crumbling was almost complete on this deep bony layer
   rested a knife of great size obvious antiquity and grotesque ornate
   and exotic designabove which the debris was piled

   in the midst of this debris wedged between a fallen plank and a
   cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney was an object
   destined to cause more bafflement veiled fright and openly
   superstitious talk in arkham than anything else discovered in the
   haunted and accursed building

   this object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat
   whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of
   singular reticence among the members of miskatonics department of
   comparative anatomy very little concerning this skeleton has leaked
   out but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the
   long brownish hairs with which it was associated

   the bones of the tiny paws it is rumoured imply prehensile
   characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat
   while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost
   anomalousness appearing from certain angles like a miniature
   monstrously degraded parody of a human skull the workmen crossed
   themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy but later
   burned candles of gratitude in st stanislaus church because of the
   shrill ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again

   they were there before they are transcripts typesthe archetypes are

   1364038the electric executionerby h p lovecraft and adolphe de
   castro1929

   for one who has never faced the danger of legal execution i have a
   rather queer horror of the electric chair as a subject indeed i think
   the topic gives me more of a shudder than it gives many a man who has
   been on trial for his life the reason is that i associate the thing
   with an incident of forty years agoa very strange incident which
   brought me close to the edge of the unknowns black abyss in 1889 i
   was an auditor and investigator connected with the tlaxcala mining
   company of san francisco which operated several small silver and
   copper properties in the san mateo mountains in mexico there had been
   some trouble at mine no 3 which had a surly furtive assistant
   superintendent named arthur feldon; and on august 6th the firm received
   a telegram saying that feldon had decamped taking with him all the
   stock records securities and private papers and leaving the whole
   clerical and financial situation in dire confusion this development
   was a severe blow to the company and late in the afternoon president
   mccomb called me into his office to give orders for the recovery of the
   papers at any cost there were he knew grave drawbacks i had never
   seen feldon and there were only very indifferent photographs to go by
   moreover my own wedding was set for thursday of the following
   weekonly nine days aheadso that i was naturally not eager to be
   hurried off to mexico on a manhunt of indefinite length the need
   however was so great that mccomb felt justified in asking me to go at
   once; and i for my part decided that the effect on my status with the
   company would make ready acquiescence eminently worth while

   i was to start that night using the presidents private car as far as
   mexico city after which i would have to take a narrowgauge railway to
   the mines jackson the superintendent of no 3 would give me all
   details and any possible clues upon my arrival; and then the search
   would begin in earnestthrough the mountains down to the coast or
   among the byways of mexico city as the case might be i set out with a
   grim determination to get the matter doneand successfully doneas
   swiftly as possible; and tempered my discontent with pictures of an
   early return with papers and culprit and of a wedding which would be
   almost a triumphal ceremony having notified my family fiancée and
   principal friends and made hasty preparations for the trip i met
   president mccomb at eight pm at the southern pacific depot received
   from him some written instructions and a checkbook and left in his
   car attached to the 8:15 eastbound transcontinental train the journey
   that followed seemed destined for uneventfulness and after a good
   nights sleep i revelled in the ease of the private car so thoughtfully
   assigned me; reading my instructions with care and formulating plans
   for the capture of feldon and the recovery of the documents i knew the
   tlaxcala country quite wellprobably much better than the missing
   manhence had a certain amount of advantage in my search unless he had
   already used the railway

   according to the instructions feldon had been a subject of worry to
   superintendent jackson for some time; acting secretively and working
   unaccountably in the companys laboratory at odd hours that he was
   implicated with a mexican boss and several peons in some thefts of ore
   was strongly suspected; but though the natives had been discharged
   there was not enough evidence to warrant any positive step regarding
   the subtle official indeed despite his furtiveness there seemed to
   be more of defiance than of guilt in the mans bearing he wore a chip
   on his shoulder and talked as if the company were cheating him instead
   of his cheating the company the obvious surveillance of his
   colleagues jackson wrote appeared to irritate him increasingly; and
   now he had gone with everything of importance in the office of his
   possible whereabouts no guess could be made; though jacksons final
   telegram suggested the wild slopes of the sierra de malinche that
   tall mythsurrounded peak with the corpseshaped silhouette from
   whose neighbourhood the thieving natives were said to have come

   at el paso which we reached at two am of the night following our
   start my private car was detached from the transcontinental train and
   joined to an engine specially ordered by telegraph to take it southward
   to mexico city i continued to drowse till dawn and all the next day
   grew bored on the flat desert chihuahua landscape the crew had told
   me we were due in mexico city at noon friday but i soon saw that
   countless delays were wasting precious hours there were waits on
   sidings all along the singletracked route and now and then a hotbox
   or other difficulty would further complicate the schedule

   at torreón we were six hours late and it was almost eight oclock on
   friday eveningfully twelve hours behind schedulewhen the conductor
   consented to do some speeding in an effort to make up time my nerves
   were on edge and i could do nothing but pace the car in desperation
   in the end i found that the speeding had been purchased at a high cost
   indeed for within a halfhour the symptoms of a hotbox had developed
   in my car itself; so that after a maddening wait the crew decided that
   all the bearings would have to be overhauled after a quarterspeed limp
   ahead to the next station with shopsthe factory town of querétaro
   this was the last straw and i almost stamped like a child actually i
   sometimes caught myself pushing at my chairarm as if trying to urge
   the train forward at a less snaillike pace

   it was almost ten in the evening when we drew into querétaro and i
   spent a fretful hour on the station platform while my car was
   sidetracked and tinkered at by a dozen native mechanics at last they
   told me the job was too much for them since the forward truck needed
   new parts which could not be obtained nearer than mexico city
   everything indeed seemed against me and i gritted my teeth when i
   thought of feldon getting farther and farther awayperhaps to the easy
   cover of vera cruz with its shipping or mexico city with its varied
   rail facilitieswhile fresh delays kept me tied and helpless of
   course jackson had notified the police in all the cities around but i
   knew with sorrow what their efficiency amounted to

   the best i could do i soon found out was to take the regular night
   express for mexico city which ran from aguas calientes and made a
   fiveminute stop at querétaro it would be along at one am if on
   time and was due in mexico city at five oclock saturday morning when
   i purchased my ticket i found that the train would be made up of
   european compartment carriages instead of long american cars with rows
   of twoseat chairs these had been much used in the early days of
   mexican railroading owing to the european construction interests back
   of the first lines; and in 1889 the mexican central was still running a
   fair number of them on its shorter trips ordinarily i prefer the
   american coaches since i hate to have people facing me; but for this
   once i was glad of the foreign carriage at such a time of night i
   stood a good chance of having a whole compartment to myself and in my
   tired nervously hypersensitive state i welcomed the solitudeas well
   as the comfortably upholstered seat with soft armrests and
   headcushion running the whole width of the vehicle i bought a
   firstclass ticket obtained my valise from the sidetracked private
   car telegraphed both president mccomb and jackson of what had
   happened and settled down in the station to wait for the night express
   as patiently as my strained nerves would let me for a wonder the
   train was only half an hour late; though even so the solitary station
   vigil had about finished my endurance the conductor shewing me into a
   compartment told me he expected to make up the delay and reach the
   capital on time; and i stretched myself comfortably on the
   forwardfacing seat in the expectation of a quiet threeandahalfhour
   run the light from the overhead oil lamp was soothingly dim and i
   wondered whether i could snatch some muchneeded sleep in spite of my
   anxiety and nervetension it seemed as the train jolted into motion
   that i was alone; and i was heartily glad of it my thoughts leaped
   ahead to my quest and i nodded with the accelerating rhythm of the
   speeding string of carriages

   then suddenly i perceived that i was not alone after all in the corner
   diagonally opposite me slumped down so that his face was invisible
   sat a roughly clad man of unusual size whom the feeble light had
   failed to reveal before beside him on the seat was a huge valise
   battered and bulging and tightly gripped even in his sleep by one of
   his incongruously slender hands as the engine whistled sharply at some
   curve or crossing the sleeper started nervously into a kind of
   watchful halfawakening; raising his head and disclosing a handsome
   face bearded and clearly anglosaxon with dark lustrous eyes at
   sight of me his wakefulness became complete and i wondered at the
   rather hostile wildness of his glance no doubt i thought he resented
   my presence when he had hoped to have the compartment alone all the
   way; just as i was myself disappointed to find strange company in the
   halflighted carriage the best we could do however was to accept the
   situation gracefully; so i began apologising to the man for my
   intrusion he seemed to be a fellowamerican and we could both feel
   more at ease after a few civilities then we could leave each other in
   peace for the balance of the journey

   to my surprise the stranger did not respond to my courtesies with so
   much as a word instead he kept staring at me fiercely and almost
   appraisingly and brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a cigar with
   a nervous lateral movement of his disengaged hand his other hand still
   tensely clutched the great worn valise and his whole person seemed to
   radiate some obscure malignity after a time he abruptly turned his
   face toward the window though there was nothing to see in the dense
   blackness outside oddly he appeared to be looking at something as
   intently as if there really were something to look at i decided to
   leave him to his own curious devices and meditations without further
   annoyance; so settled back in my seat drew the brim of my soft hat
   over my face and closed my eyes in an effort to snatch the sleep i had
   half counted on

   i could not have dozed very long or very fully when my eyes fell open
   as if in response to some external force closing them again with some
   determination i renewed my quest of a nap yet wholly without avail
   an intangible influence seemed bent on keeping me awake; so raising my
   head i looked about the dimly lighted compartment to see if anything
   were amiss all appeared normal but i noticed that the stranger in the
   opposite corner was looking at me very intentlyintently though
   without any of the geniality or friendliness which would have implied a
   change from his former surly attitude i did not attempt conversation
   this time but leaned back in my previous sleepy posture; half closing
   my eyes as if i had dozed off once more yet continuing to watch him
   curiously from beneath my downturned hat brim as the train rattled
   onward through the night i saw a subtle and gradual metamorphosis come
   over the expression of the staring man evidently satisfied that i was
   asleep he allowed his face to reflect a curious jumble of emotions
   the nature of which seemed anything but reassuring hatred fear
   triumph and fanaticism flickered compositely over the lines of his
   lips and the angles of his eyes while his gaze became a glare of
   really alarming greed and ferocity suddenly it dawned upon me that
   this man was mad and dangerously so i will not pretend that i was
   anything but deeply and thoroughly frightened when i saw how things
   stood perspiration started out all over me and i had hard work to
   maintain my attitude of relaxation and slumber life had many
   attractions for me just then and the thought of dealing with a
   homicidal maniacpossibly armed and certainly powerful to a marvellous
   degreewas a dismaying and terrifying one my disadvantage in any sort
   of struggle was enormous; for the man was a virtual giant evidently in
   the best of athletic trim while i have always been rather frail and
   was then almost worn out with anxiety sleeplessness and nervous
   tension it was undeniably a bad moment for me and i felt pretty close
   to a horrible death as i recognised the fury of madness in the
   strangers eyes events from the past came up into my consciousness as
   if for a farewelljust as a drowning mans whole life is said to
   resurrect itself before him at the last moment

   of course i had my revolver in my coat pocket but any motion of mine
   to reach and draw it would be instantly obvious moreover if i did
   secure it there was no telling what effect it would have on the
   maniac even if i shot him once or twice he might have enough remaining
   strength to get the gun from me and deal with me in his own way; or if
   he were armed himself he might shoot or stab without trying to disarm
   me one can cow a sane man by covering him with a pistol but an insane
   mans complete indifference to consequences gives him a strength and
   menace quite superhuman for the time being even in those prefreudian
   days i had a commonsense realisation of the dangerous power of a
   person without normal inhibitions that the stranger in the corner was
   indeed about to start some murderous action his burning eyes and
   twitching facial muscles did not permit me to doubt for a moment

   suddenly i heard his breath begin to come in excited gasps and saw his
   chest heaving with mounting excitement the time for a showdown was
   close and i tried desperately to think of the best thing to do
   without interrupting my pretence of sleep i began to slide my right
   hand gradually and inconspicuously toward the pocket containing my
   pistol; watching the madman closely as i did so to see if he would
   detect any move unfortunately he didalmost before he had time to
   register the fact in his expression with a bound so agile and abrupt
   as to be almost incredible in a man of his size he was upon me before
   i knew what had happened; looming up and swaying forward like a giant
   ogre of legend and pinioning me with one powerful hand while with the
   other he forestalled me in reaching the revolver taking it from my
   pocket and placing it in his own he released me contemptuously well
   knowing how fully his physique placed me at his mercy then he stood up
   at his full heighthis head almost touching the roof of the
   carriageand stared down at me with eyes whose fury had quickly turned
   to a look of pitying scorn and ghoulish calculation

   i did not move and after a moment the man resumed his seat opposite
   me; smiling a ghastly smile as he opened his great bulging valise and
   extracted an article of peculiar appearancea rather large cage of
   semiflexible wire woven somewhat like a baseball catchers mask but
   shaped more like the helmet of a divingsuit its top was connected
   with a cord whose other end remained in the valise this device he
   fondled with obvious affection cradling it in his lap as he looked at
   me afresh and licked his bearded lips with an almost feline motion of
   the tongue then for the first time he spokein a deep mellow voice
   of softness and cultivation startlingly at variance with his rough
   corduroy clothes and unkempt aspect

   you are fortunate sir i shall use you first of all you shall go
   into history as the first fruits of a remarkable invention vast
   sociological consequencesi shall let my light shine as it were im
   radiating all the time but nobody knows it now you shall know
   intelligent guineapig cats and burrosit worked even with a burro 
    

   he paused while his bearded features underwent a convulsive motion
   closely synchronised with a vigorous gyratory shaking of the whole
   head it was as though he were shaking clear of some nebulous
   obstructing medium for the gesture was followed by a clarification or
   subtilisation of expression which hid the more obvious madness in a
   look of suave composure through which the craftiness gleamed only
   dimly i glimpsed the difference at once and put in a word to see if i
   could lead his mind into harmless channels you seem to have a
   marvellously fine instrument if im any judge wont you tell me how
   you came to invent it? he nodded

   mere logical reflection dear sir i consulted the needs of the age
   and acted upon them others might have done the same had their minds
   been as powerfulthat is as capable of sustained concentrationas
   mine i had the sense of convictionthe available will powerthat is
   all i realised as no one else has yet realised how imperative it is
   to remove everybody from the earth before quetzalcoatl comes back and
   realised also that it must be done elegantly i hate butchery of any
   kind and hanging is barbarously crude you know last year the new york
   legislature voted to adopt electric execution for condemned menbut
   all the apparatus they have in mind is as primitive as stephensons
   `rocket or davenports first electric engine i knew of a better way
   and told them so but they paid no attention to me god the fools! as
   if i didnt know all there is to know about men and death and
   electricitystudent man and boytechnologist and engineersoldier
   of fortune   

   he leaned back and narrowed his eyes

   i was in maximilians army twenty years and more ago they were going
   to make me a nobleman then those damned greasers killed him and i had
   to go home but i came backback and forth back and forth i live in
   rochester ny   

   his eyes grew deeply crafty and he leaned forward touching me on the
   knee with the fingers of a paradoxically delicate hand i came back i
   say and i went deeper than any of them i hate greasers but i like
   mexicans! a puzzle? listen to me young fellowyou dont think mexico
   is really spanish do you? god if you knew the tribes i know! in the
   mountainsin the mountainsanahuactenochtitlanthe old ones  
   

   his voice changed to a chanting and not unmelodious howl

   i?! huitzilopotchli!    nahuatlacatl! seven seven seven   
   xochimilca chalca tepaneca acolhua tlahuica tlascalteca azteca! 
     i?! i?! i have been to the seven caves of chicomoztoc but no one
   shall ever know! i tell you because you will never repeat it

   he subsided and resumed a conversational tone

   it would surprise you to know what things are told in the mountains
   huitzilopotchli is coming back    of that there can be no doubt any
   peon south of mexico city can tell you that but i meant to do nothing
   about it i went home as i tell you again and again and was going to
   benefit society with my electric executioner when that cursed albany
   legislature adopted the other way a joke sir a joke! grandfathers
   chairsit by the firesidehawthorne

   the man was chuckling with a morbid parody of good nature

   why sir id like to be the first man to sit in their damned chair
   and feel their little twobit battery current! it wouldnt make a
   frogs legs dance! and they expect to kill murderers with itreward of
   meriteverything! but then young man i saw the uselessnessthe
   pointless illogicality as it wereof killing just a few everybody is
   a murdererthey murder ideassteal inventionsstole mine by
   watching and watching and watching

   the man choked and paused and i spoke soothingly

   im sure your invention was much the better and probably theyll come
   to use it in the end

   evidently my tact was not great enough for his response shewed fresh
   irritation

   `sure are you? nice mild conservative assurance! cursed lot you
   carebut youll soon know! why damn you all the good there ever will
   be in that electric chair will have been stolen from me the ghost of
   nezahualpilli told me that on the sacred mountain they watched and
   watched and watched

   he choked again then gave another of those gestures in which he seemed
   to shake both his head and his facial expression that seemed
   temporarily to steady him

   what my invention needs is testing that is ithere the wire hood or
   headnet is flexible and slips on easily neckpiece binds but doesnt
   choke electrodes touch forehead and base of cerebellumall thats
   necessary stop the head and what else can go? the fools up at albany
   with their carved oak easychair think theyve got to make it a
   headtofoot affair idiots!dont they know that you dont need to
   shoot a man through the body after youve plugged him through the
   brain? ive seen men die in battlei know better and then their silly
   highpower circuitdynamosall that why didnt they see what ive
   done with the storagebattery? not a hearingnobody knowsi alone
   have the secretthats why i and quetzalcoatl and huitzilopotchli will
   rule the world alonei and they if i choose to let them    but i
   must have experimental subjectssubjectsdo you know whom ive chosen
   for the first?

   i tried jocoseness quickly merging into friendly seriousness as a
   sedative quick thought and apt words might save me yet

   well there are lots of fine subjects among the politicians of san
   francisco where i come from! they need your treatment and id like to
   help you introduce it! but really i think i can help you in all truth
   i have some influence in sacramento and if youll go back to the
   states with me after im through with my business in mexico ill see
   that you get a hearing

   he answered soberly and civilly

   noi cant go back i swore not to when those criminals at albany
   turned down my invention and set spies to watch me and steal from me
   but i must have american subjects those greasers are under a curse
   and would be too easy; and the fullblood indiansthe real children of
   the feathered serpentare sacred and inviolate except for proper
   sacrificial victims    and even those must be slain according to
   ceremony i must have americans without going backand the first man i
   choose will be signally honoured do you know who he is? i temporised
   desperately

   oh if thats all the trouble ill find you a dozen firstrate yankee
   specimens as soon as we get to mexico city! i know where there are lots
   of small mining men who wouldnt be missed for days

   but he cut me short with a new and sudden air of authority which had a
   touch of real dignity in it

   thatll doweve trifled long enough get up and stand erect like a
   man youre the subject ive chosen and youll thank me for the honour
   in the other world just as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest
   for transferring him to eternal glory a new principleno other man
   alive has dreamed of such a battery and it might never again be hit on
   if the world experimented a thousand years do you know that atoms
   arent what they seem? fools! a century after this some dolt would be
   guessing if i were to let the world live! as i arose at his command
   he drew additional feet of cord from the valise and stood erect beside
   me; the wire helmet outstretched toward me in both hands and a look of
   real exaltation on his tanned and bearded face for an instant he
   seemed like a radiant hellenic mystagogue or hierophant

   here o youtha libation! wine of the cosmosnectar of the starry
   spaceslinosiacchusialmenoszagreusdionysosatyshylassprun
   g from apollo and slain by the hounds of argosseed of psamathechild
   of the sunevoë! evoë!

   he was chanting again and this time his mind seemed far back amongst
   the classic memories of his college days in my erect posture i noticed
   the nearness of the signal cord overhead and wondered whether i could
   reach it through some gesture of ostensible response to his ceremonial
   mood it was worth trying so with an antiphonal cry of evoë! i put
   my arms forward and upward toward him in a ritualistic fashion hoping
   to give the cord a tug before he could notice the act but it was
   useless he saw my purpose and moved one hand toward the righthand
   coat pocket where my revolver lay no words were needed and we stood
   for a moment like carven figures then he quietly said make haste!

   again my mind rushed frantically about seeking avenues of escape the
   doors i knew were not locked on mexican trains; but my companion
   could easily forestall me if i tried to unlatch one and jump out
   besides our speed was so great that success in that direction would
   probably be as fatal as failure the only thing to do was to play for
   time of the threeandahalfhour trip a good slice was already worn
   away and once we got to mexico city the guards and police in the
   station would provide instant safety

   there would i thought be two distinct times for diplomatic stalling
   if i could get him to postpone the slipping on of the hood that much
   time would be gained of course i had no belief that the thing was
   really deadly; but i knew enough of madmen to understand what would
   happen when it failed to work to his disappointment would be added a
   mad sense of my responsibility for the failure and the result would be
   a red chaos of murderous rage therefore the experiment must be
   postponed as long as possible yet the second opportunity did exist
   for if i planned cleverly i might devise explanations for the failure
   which would hold his attention and lead him into more or less extended
   searches for corrective influences i wondered just how far his
   credulity went and whether i could prepare in advance a prophecy of
   failure which would make the failure itself stamp me as a seer or
   initiate or perhaps a god i had enough of a smattering of mexican
   mythology to make it worth trying; though i would try other delaying
   influences first and let the prophecy come as a sudden revelation
   would he spare me in the end if i could make him think me a prophet or
   divinity? could i get by as quetzalcoatl or huitzilopotchli? anything
   to drag matters out till five oclock when we were due in mexico city

   but my opening stall was the veteran willmaking ruse as the maniac
   repeated his command for haste i told him of my family and intended
   marriage and asked for the privilege of leaving a message and
   disposing of my money and effects if i said he would lend me some
   paper and agree to mail what i should write i could die more
   peacefully and willingly after some cogitation he gave a favourable
   verdict and fished in his valise for a pad which he handed me solemnly
   as i resumed my seat i produced a pencil artfully breaking the point
   at the outset and causing some delay while he searched for one of his
   own when he gave me this he took my broken pencil and proceeded to
   sharpen it with a large hornhandled knife which had been in his belt
   under his coat evidently a second pencilbreaking would not profit me
   greatly

   what i wrote i can hardly recall at this date it was largely
   gibberish and composed of random scraps of memorised literature when i
   could think of nothing else to set down i made my handwriting as
   illegible as i could without destroying its nature as writing; for i
   knew he would be likely to look at the result before commencing his
   experiment and realised how he would react to the sight of obvious
   nonsense the ordeal was a terrible one and i chafed each second at
   the slowness of the train in the past i had often whistled a brisk
   gallop to the sprightly tac of wheels on rails but now the tempo
   seemed slowed down to that of a funeral marchmy funeral march i
   grimly reflected

   my ruse worked till i had covered over four pages six by nine; when at
   last the madman drew out his watch and told me i could have but five
   minutes more what should i do next? i was hastily going through the
   form of concluding the will when a new idea struck me ending with a
   flourish and handing him the finished sheets which he thrust
   carelessly into his lefthand coat pocket i reminded him of my
   influential sacramento friends who would be so much interested in his
   invention

   oughtnt i to give you a letter of introduction to them? i said
   oughtnt i to make a signed sketch and description of your executioner
   so that theyll grant you a cordial hearing? they can make you famous
   you knowand theres no question at all but that theyll adopt your
   method for the state of california if they hear of it through someone
   like me whom they know and trust

   i was taking this tack on the chance that his thoughts as a
   disappointed inventor would let him forget the aztecreligious side of
   his mania for a while when he veered to the latter again i reflected
   i would spring the revelation and prophecy the scheme worked for
   his eyes glowed an eager assent though he brusquely told me to be
   quick he further emptied the valise lifting out a queerlooking
   congeries of glass cells and coils to which the wire from the helmet
   was attached and delivering a fire of running comment too technical
   for me to follow yet apparently quite plausible and straightforward i
   pretended to note down all he said wondering as i did so whether the
   queer apparatus was really a battery after all would i get a slight
   shock when he applied the device? the man surely talked as if he were a
   genuine electrician description of his own invention was clearly a
   congenial task for him and i saw he was not as impatient as before
   the hopeful grey of dawn glimmered red through the windows before he
   wound up and i felt at last that my chance of escape had really become
   tangible

   but he too saw the dawn and began glaring wildly again he knew the
   train was due in mexico city at five and would certainly force quick
   action unless i could override all his judgment with engrossing ideas
   as he rose with a determined air setting the battery on the seat
   beside the open valise i reminded him that i had not made the needed
   sketch; and asked him to hold the headpiece so that i could draw it
   near the battery he complied and resumed his seat with many
   admonitions to me to hurry after another moment i paused for some
   information asking him how the victim was placed for execution and
   how his presumable struggles were overcome

   why he replied the criminal is securely strapped to a post it
   does not matter how much he tosses his head for the helmet fits
   tightly and draws even closer when the current comes on we turn the
   switch graduallyyou see it here a carefully arranged affair with a
   rheostat

   a new idea for delay occurred to me as the tilled fields and
   increasingly frequent houses in the dawnlight outside told of our
   approach to the capital at last

   but i said i must draw the helmet in place on a human head as well
   as beside the battery cant you slip it on yourself a moment so that i
   can sketch you with it? the papers as well as the officials will want
   all this and they are strong on completeness i had by chance made
   a better shot than i had planned; for at my mention of the press the
   madmans eyes lit up afresh the papers? yesdamn them you can make
   even the papers give me a hearing! they all laughed at me and wouldnt
   print a word here you hurry up! weve not a second to lose!

   he had slipped the headpiece on and was watching my flying pencil
   avidly the wire mesh gave him a grotesque comic look as he sat there
   with nervously twitching hands

   now curse em theyll print pictures! ill revise your sketch if you
   make any blundersmust be accurate at any cost police will find you
   afterwardtheyll tell how it works associated press itemback up
   your letterimmortal fame    hurry i sayhurry confound you!
   the train was lurching over the poorer roadbed near the city and we
   swayed disconcertingly now and then with this excuse i managed to
   break the pencil again but of course the maniac at once handed me my
   own which he had sharpened my first batch of ruses was about used up
   and i felt that i should have to submit to the headpiece in a moment
   we were still a good quarterhour from the terminal and it was about
   time for me to divert my companion to his religious side and spring the
   divine prophecy

   mustering up my scraps of nahuanaztec mythology i suddenly threw down
   pencil and paper and commenced to chant

   i?! i?! tloquenahuaque thou who art all in thyself! thou too
   ipalnemoan by whom we live! i hear i hear! i see i see!
   serpentbearing eagle hail! a message! a message! huitzilopotchli in
   my soul echoes thy thunder!

   at my intonations the maniac stared incredulously through his odd mask
   his handsome face shewn in a surprise and perplexity which quickly
   changed to alarm his mind seemed to go blank a moment and then to
   recrystallise in another pattern raising his hands aloft he chanted
   as if in a dream

   mictlanteuctli great lord a sign! a sign from within thy black cave!
   i?! tonatiuhmetztli! cthulhutl! command and i serve! now in all this
   responsive gibberish there was one word which struck an odd chord in my
   memory odd because it never occurs in any printed account of mexican
   mythology yet had been overheard by me more than once as an awestruck
   whisper amongst the peons in my own firms tlaxcala mines it seemed to
   be part of an exceedingly secret and ancient ritual; for there were
   characteristic whispered responses which i had caught now and then and
   which were as unknown as itself to academic scholarship this maniac
   must have spent considerable time with the hill peons and indians just
   as he had said; for surely such unrecorded lore could have come from no
   mere booklearning realising the importance he must attach to this
   doubly esoteric jargon i determined to strike at his most vulnerable
   spot and give him the gibberish responses the natives used

   yarlyeh! yarlyeh! i shouted cthulhutl fhtaghn! niguratlyig!
   yogsototl

   but i never had a chance to finish galvanised into a religious
   epilepsy by the exact response which his subconscious mind had probably
   not really expected the madman scrambled down to a kneeling posture on
   the floor bowing his wirehelmeted head again and again and turning
   it to the right and left as he did so with each turn his obeisances
   became more profound and i could hear his foaming lips repeating the
   syllable kill kill kill in a rapidly swelling monotone it
   occurred to me that i had overreached myself and that my response had
   unloosed a mounting mania which would rouse him to the slayingpoint
   before the train reached the station

   as the arc of the madmans turnings gradually increased the slack in
   the cord from his headpiece to the battery had naturally been taken up
   more and more now in an allforgetting delirium of ecstasy he began
   to magnify his turns to complete circles so that the cord wound round
   his neck and began to tug at its moorings to the battery on the seat i
   wondered what he would do when the inevitable would happen and the
   battery would be dragged to presumable destruction on the floor

   then came the sudden cataclysm the battery yanked over the seats
   edge by the maniacs last gesture of orgiastic frenzy did indeed fall;
   but it did not seem to have wholly broken instead as my eye caught
   the spectacle in one toofleeting instant the actual impact was borne
   by the rheostat so that the switch was jerked over instantly to full
   current and the marvellous thing is that there was a current the
   invention was no mere dream of insanity

   i saw a blinding blue auroral coruscation heard an ululating shriek
   more hideous than any of the previous cries of that mad horrible
   journey and smelled the nauseous odour of burning flesh that was all
   my overwrought consciousness could bear and i sank instantly into
   oblivion

   when the train guard at mexico city revived me i found a crowd on the
   station platform around my compartment door at my involuntary cry the
   pressing faces became curious and dubious and i was glad when the
   guard shut out all but the trim doctor who had pushed his way through
   to me my cry was a very natural thing but it had been prompted by
   something more than the shocking sight on the carriage floor which i
   had expected to see or should say by something less because in truth
   there was not anything on the floor at all

   nor said the guard had there been when he opened the door and found
   me unconscious within my ticket was the only one sold for that
   compartment and i was the only person found within it just myself and
   my valise nothing more i had been alone all the way from querétaro
   guard doctor and spectators alike tapped their foreheads
   significantly at my frantic and insistent questions

   had it all been a dream or was i indeed mad? i recalled my anxiety and
   overwrought nerves and shuddered thanking the guard and doctor and
   shaking free of the curious crowd i staggered into a cab and was taken
   to the fonda nacional where after telegraphing jackson at the mine i
   slept till afternoon in an effort to get a fresh grip on myself i had
   myself called at one oclock in time to catch the narrowgauge for the
   mining country but when i got up i found a telegram under the door it
   was from jackson and said that feldon had been found dead in the
   mountains that morning the news reaching the mine about ten oclock
   the papers were all safe and the san francisco office had been duly
   notified so the whole trip with its nervous haste and harrowing
   mental ordeal had been for nothing! knowing that mccomb would expect a
   personal report despite the course of events i sent another wire ahead
   and took the narrowgauge after all four hours later i was rattled and
   jolted into the station of mine no 3 where jackson was waiting to
   give a cordial greeting he was so full of the affair at the mine that
   he did not notice my still shaken and seedy appearance

   the superintendents story was brief and he told me it as he led me
   toward the shack up the hillside above the arrastre where feldons
   body lay feldon he said had always been a queer sullen character
   ever since he was hired the year before; working at some secret
   mechanical device and complaining of constant espionage and being
   disgustingly familiar with the native workmen but he certainly knew
   the work the country and the people he used to make long trips into
   the hills where the peons lived and even to take part in some of their
   ancient heathenish ceremonies he hinted at odd secrets and strange
   powers as often as he boasted of his mechanical skill of late he had
   disintegrated rapidly; growing morbidly suspicious of his colleagues
   and undoubtedly joining his native friends in orethieving after his
   cash got low he needed unholy amounts of money for something or
   otherwas always having boxes come from laboratories and machine shops
   in mexico city or the states

   as for the final absconding with all the papersit was only a crazy
   gesture of revenge for what he called spying he was certainly stark
   mad for he had gone across country to a hidden cave on the wild slope
   of the haunted sierra de malinche where no white men live and had
   done some amazingly queer things the cave which would never have been
   found but for the final tragedy was full of hideous old aztec idols
   and altars; the latter covered with the charred bones of recent
   burntofferings of doubtful nature the natives would tell
   nothingindeed they swore they knew nothingbut it was easy to see
   that the cave was an old rendezvous of theirs and that feldon had
   shared their practices to the fullest extent

   the searchers had found the place only because of the chanting and the
   final cry it had been close to five that morning and after an
   allnight encampment the party had begun to pack up for its
   emptyhanded return to the mines then somebody had heard faint rhythms
   in the distance and knew that one of the noxious old native rituals
   was being howled from some lonely spot up the slope of the
   corpseshaped mountain they heard the same old namesmictlanteuctli
   tonatiuhmetzli cthulhutl yarlyeh and all the restbut the queer
   thing was that some english words were mixed with them real white
   mans english and no greaser patter guided by the sound they had
   hastened up the weedentangled mountainside toward it when after a
   spell of quiet the shriek had burst upon them it was a terrible
   thinga worse thing than any of them had ever heard before there
   seemed to be some smoke too and a morbid acrid smell

   then they stumbled on the cave its entrance screened by scrub
   mesquites but now emitting clouds of foetid smoke it was lighted
   within the horrible altars and grotesque images revealed flickeringly
   by candles which must have been changed less than a halfhour before;
   and on the gravelly floor lay the horror that made all the crowd reel
   backward it was feldon head burned to a crisp by some odd device he
   had slipped over ita kind of wire cage connected with a rather
   shakenup battery which had evidently fallen to the floor from a nearby
   altarpot when the men saw it they exchanged glances thinking of the
   electric executioner feldon had always boasted of inventingthe
   thing which everyone had rejected but had tried to steal and copy the
   papers were safe in feldons open portmanteau which stood close by and
   an hour later the column of searchers started back for no 3 with a
   grisly burden on an improvised stretcher

   that was all but it was enough to make me turn pale and falter as
   jackson led me up past the arrastre to the shed where he said the body
   lay for i was not without imagination and knew only too well into
   what hellish nightmare this tragedy somehow supernaturally dovetailed
   i knew what i should see inside that gaping door around which the
   curious miners clustered and did not flinch when my eyes took in the
   giant form the rough corduroy clothes the oddly delicate hands the
   wisps of burnt beard and the hellish machine itselfbattery slightly
   broken and headpiece blackened by the charring of what was inside the
   great bulging portmanteau did not surprise me and i quailed only at
   two thingsthe folded sheets of paper sticking out of the lefthand
   pocket and the queer sagging of the corresponding righthand pocket
   in a moment when no one was looking i reached out and seized the too
   familiar sheets crushing them in my hand without daring to look at
   their penmanship i ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic fear
   made me burn them that night with averted eyes they would have been a
   positive proof or disproof of somethingbut for that matter i could
   still have had proof by asking about the revolver the coroner afterward
   took from that sagging righthand coat pocket i never had the courage
   to ask about thatbecause my own revolver was missing after the night
   on the train my pocket pencil too shewed signs of a crude and hasty
   sharpening unlike the precise pointing i had given it friday afternoon
   on the machine in president mccombs private car

   so in the end i went home still puzzledmercifully puzzled perhaps
   the private car was repaired when i got back to querétaro but my
   greatest relief was crossing the rio grande into el paso and the
   states by the next friday i was in san francisco again and the
   postponed wedding came off the following week

   as to what really happened that nightas ive said i simply dont
   dare to speculate that chap feldon was insane to start with and on
   top of his insanity he had piled a lot of prehistoric aztec witchlore
   that nobody has any right to know he was really an inventive genius
   and that battery must have been the genuine stuff i heard later how he
   had been brushed aside in former years by press public and potentates
   alike too much disappointment isnt good for men of a certain kind
   anyhow some unholy combination of influences was at work he had
   really by the way been a soldier of maximilians

   when i tell my story most people call me a plain liar others lay it to
   abnormal psychologyand heaven knows i was overwroughtwhile still
   others talk of astral projection of some sort my zeal to catch
   feldon certainly sent my thoughts ahead toward him and with all his
   indian magic hed be about the first one to recognise and meet them
   was he in the railway carriage or was i in the cave on the
   corpseshaped haunted mountain? what would have happened to me had i
   not delayed him as i did? ill confess i dont know and im not sure
   that i want to know ive never been in mexico sinceand as i said at
   the start i dont enjoy hearing about electric executions

   the evil clergyman
   by h p lovecraft
   8533the evil clergymanh p lovecraft

   i was shown into the attic chamber by a grave intelligentlooking man
   with quiet clothes and an irongray beard who spoke to me in this
   fashion:

   yes he lived here  but i dont advise your doing anything your
   curiosity makes you irresponsible we never come here at night and
   its only because of his will that we keep it this way you know what
   he did that abominable society took charge at last and we dont know
   where he is buried there was no way the law or anything else could
   reach the society

   i hope you wont stay till after dark and i beg of you to let that
   thing on the table  the thing that looks like a matchbox  alone we
   dont know what it is but we suspect it has something to do with what
   he did we even avoid looking at it very steadily

   after a time the man left me alone in the attic room it was very dingy
   and dusty and only primitively furnished but it had a neatness which
   showed it was not a slumdenizens quarters there were shelves full of
   theological and classical books and another bookcase containing
   treatises on magic  paracelsus albertus magnus trithemius hermes
   trismegistus borellus and others in a strange alphabet whose titles i
   could not decipher the furniture was very plain there was a door but
   it led only into a closet the only egress was the aperture in the
   floor up to which the crude steep staircase led the windows were of
   bullseye pattern and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable
   antiquity plainly this house was of the old world i seemed to know
   where i was but cannot recall what i then knew certainly the town was
   not london my impression is of a small seaport

   the small object on the table fascinated me intensely i seemed to know
   what to do with it for i drew a pocket electric light  or what looked
   like one  out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes the light
   was not white but violet and seemed less like true light than like
   some radioactive bombardment i recall that i did not regard it as a
   common flashlight  indeed i had a common flashlight in another
   pocket

   it was getting dark and the ancient roofs and chimneypots outside
   looked very queer through the bullseye windowpanes finally i
   summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table
   against a book  then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon
   it the light seemed now to be more like a rain of hail or small violet
   particles than like a continuous beam as the particles struck the
   glassy surface at the center of the strange device they seemed to
   produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through
   which sparks are passed the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish
   glow and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its center
   then i noticed that i was not alone in the room  and put the
   rayprojector back in my pocket

   but the newcomer did not speak  nor did i hear any sound whatever
   during all the immediately following moments everything was shadowy
   pantomime as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze
    although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers
   loomed large and close as if both near and distant according to some
   abnormal geometry

   the newcomer was a thin dark man of medium height attired in the
   clerical garb of the anglican church he was apparently about thirty
   years old with a sallow olive complexion and fairly good features
   but an abnormally high forehead his black hair was well cut and neatly
   brushed and he was cleanshaven though bluechinned with a heavy
   growth of beard he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows his build
   and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen but he
   had a vastly higher forehead and was darker and more
   intelligentlooking  also more subtly and concealedly evillooking at
   the present moment  having just lighted a faint oil lamp  he looked
   nervous and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into
   a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted
   sharply) which i had not noticed before the flames devoured the
   volumes greedily  leaping up in strange colors and emitting
   indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and
   wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element all at once i saw
   there were others in the room  gravelooking men in clerical costume
   one of whom wore the bands and kneebreeches of a bishop though i
   could hear nothing i could see that they were bringing a decision of
   vast import to the firstcomer they seemed to hate and fear him at the
   same time and he seemed to return these sentiments his face set
   itself into a grim expression but i could see his right hand shaking
   as he tried to grip the back of a chair the bishop pointed to the
   empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down amidst
   a charred noncommittal mass) and seemed filled with a peculiar
   loathing the firstcomer then gave a wry smile and reached out with
   his left hand toward the small object on the table everyone then
   seemed frightened the procession of clerics began filing down the
   steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor turning and making
   menacing gestures as they left the bishop was last to go

   the firstcomer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room
   and extracted a coil of rope mounting a chair he attached one end of
   the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak and
   began making a noose with the other end realizing he was about to hang
   himself i started forward to dissuade or save him he saw me and
   ceased his preparations looking at me with a kind of triumph which
   puzzled and disturbed me he slowly stepped down from the chair and
   began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark
   thinlipped face

   i felt somehow in deadly peril and drew out the peculiar rayprojector
   as a weapon of defense why i thought it could help me i do not know
   i turned it on  full in his face and saw the sallow features glow
   first with violet and then with pinkish light his expression of
   wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear
    which did not however wholly displace the exultation he stopped in
   his tracks  then flailing his arms wildly in the air began to
   stagger backwards i saw he was edging toward the open stairwell in
   the floor and tried to shout a warning but he did not hear me in
   another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was
   lost to view

   i found difficulty in moving toward the stairwell but when i did get
   there i found no crushed body on the floor below instead there was a
   clatter of people coming up with lanterns for the spell of phantasmal
   silence had broken and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as
   normally tridimensional something had evidently drawn a crowd to this
   place had there been a noise i had not heard?

   presently the two people (simple villagers apparently) farthest in the
   lead saw me  and stood paralyzed one of them shrieked loudly and
   reverberantly:

   ahrrh!     it beee zur? again?

   then they all turned and fled frantically all that is but one when
   the crowd was gone i saw the gravebearded man who had brought me to
   this place  standing alone with a lantern he was gazing at me
   gaspingly and fascinatedly but did not seem afraid then he began to
   ascend the stairs and joined me in the attic he spoke:

   so you didnt let it alone! im sorry i know what has happened it
   happened once before but the man got frightened and shot himself you
   ought not to have made him come back you know what he wants but you
   mustnt get frightened like the other man he got something very
   strange and terrible has happened to you but it didnt get far enough
   to hurt your mind and personality if youll keep cool and accept the
   need for making certain radical readjustments in your life you can
   keep right on enjoying the world and the fruits of your scholarship
   but you cant live here  and i dont think youll wish to go back to
   london id advise america

   you mustnt try anything more with that thing nothing can be put
   back now it would only make matters worse to do  or summon 
   anything you are not as badly off as you might be  but you must get
   out of here at once and stay away youd better thank heaven it didnt
   go further   

   im going to prepare you as bluntly as i can theres been a certain
   change  in your personal appearance he always causes that but in a
   new country you can get used to it theres a mirror up at the other
   end of the room and im going to take you to it youll get a shock 
   though you will see nothing repulsive

   i was now shaking with a deadly fear and the bearded man almost had to
   hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror the faint
   lamp (ie that formerly on the table not the still fainter lantern
   he had brought) in his free hand this is what i saw in the glass:

   a thin dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the
   anglican church apparently about thirty and with rimless steelbowed
   glasses glistening beneath a sallow olive forehead of abnormal height

   it was the silent firstcomer who had burned his books

   for all the rest of my life in outward form i was to be that man!

   lactantius

   i was far from home and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me in
   the twilight i heard it pounding on the rocks and i knew it lay just
   over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing
   sky and the first stars of evening and because my fathers had called
   me to the old town beyond i pushed on through the shallow newfallen
   snow along the road that soared lonely up to where aldebaran twinkled
   among the trees; on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but
   often dreamed of

   it was the yuletide that men call christmas though they know in their
   hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon older than memphis and
   mankind it was the yuletide and i had come at last to the ancient sea
   town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when
   festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to
   keep festival once every century that the memory of primal secrets
   might not be forgotten mine were an old people and were old even when
   this land was settled three hundred years before and they were
   strange because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate
   southern gardens of orchids and spoken another tongue before they
   learnt the tongue of the blueeyed fishers and now they were
   scattered and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living
   could understand i was the only one who came back that night to the
   old fishing town as legend bade for only the poor and the lonely
   remember

   then beyond the hills crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the
   gloaming; snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples
   ridgepoles and chimneypots wharves and small bridges willowtrees
   and graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep narrow crooked streets
   and dizzy churchcrowned central peak that time durst not touch;
   ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles
   and levels like a childs disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey
   wings over winterwhitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and
   smallpaned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join
   orion and the archaic stars and against the rotting wharves the sea
   pounded; the secretive immemorial sea out of which the people had come
   in the elder time

   beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose bleak and
   windswept and i saw that it was a buryingground where black
   gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed
   fingernails of a gigantic corpse the printless road was very lonely
   and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a
   gibbet in the wind they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft
   in 1692 but i did not know just where

   as the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry
   sounds of a village at evening but did not hear them then i thought
   of the season and felt that these old puritan folk might well have
   christmas customs strange to me and full of silent hearthside prayer
   so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers
   kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls
   to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt
   breeze and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along
   deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little curtained windows

   i had seen maps of the town and knew where to find the home of my
   people it was told that i should be known and welcomed for village
   legend lives long; so i hastened through back street to circle court
   and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the
   town to where green lane leads off behind the market house the old
   maps still held good and i had no trouble; though at arkham they must
   have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place since i saw
   not a wire overhead snow would have hid the rails in any case i was
   glad i had chosen to walk for the white village had seemed very
   beautiful from the hill; and now i was eager to knock at the door of my
   people the seventh house on the left in green lane with an ancient
   peaked roof and jutting second storey all built before 1650

   there were lights inside the house when i came upon it and i saw from
   the diamond windowpanes that it must have been kept very close to its
   antique state the upper part overhung the narrow grassgrown street
   and nearly met the overhanging part of the house opposite so that i
   was almost in a tunnel with the low stone doorstep wholly free from
   snow there was no sidewalk but many houses had high doors reached by
   double flights of steps with iron railings it was an odd scene and
   because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before
   though it pleased me i would have relished it better if there had been
   footprints in the snow and people in the streets and a few windows
   without drawn curtains

   when i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid some fear
   had been gathering in me perhaps because of the strangeness of my
   heritage and the bleakness of the evening and the queerness of the
   silence in that aged town of curious customs and when my knock was
   answered i was fully afraid because i had not heard any footsteps
   before the door creaked open but i was not afraid long for the
   gowned slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that
   reassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb he wrote a
   quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried

   he beckoned me into a low candlelit room with massive exposed rafters
   and dark stiff sparse furniture of the seventeenth century the past
   was vivid there for not an attribute was missing there was a
   cavernous fireplace and a spinningwheel at which a bent old woman in
   loose wrapper and deep pokebonnet sat back toward me silently
   spinning despite the festive season an indefinite dampness seemed upon
   the place and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing the
   highbacked settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left and
   seemed to be occupied though i was not sure i did not like everything
   about what i saw and felt again the fear i had had this fear grew
   stronger from what had before lessened it for the more i looked at the
   old mans bland face the more its very blandness terrified me the eyes
   never moved and the skin was too much like wax finally i was sure it
   was not a face at all but a fiendishly cunning mask but the flabby
   hands curiously gloved wrote genially on the tablet and told me i
   must wait a while before i could be led to the place of the festival

   pointing to a chair table and pile of books the old man now left the
   room; and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and
   mouldy and that they included old morrysters wild marvels of science
   the terrible saducismus triumphatus of joseph glanvil published in
   1681 the shocking daemonolatreja of remigius printed in 1595 at
   lyons and worst of all the unmentionable necronomicon of the mad arab
   abdul alhazred in olaus wormius forbidden latin translation; a book
   which i had never seen but of which i had heard monstrous things
   whispered no one spoke to me but i could hear the creaking of signs
   in the wind outside and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old
   woman continued her silent spinning spinning i thought the room and
   the books and the people very morbid and disquieting but because an
   old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings i
   resolved to expect queer things so i tried to read and soon became
   tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursed
   necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or
   consciousness but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of
   one of the windows that the settle faced as if it had been stealthily
   opened it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old
   womans spinningwheel this was not much though for the old woman
   was spinning very hard and the aged clock had been striking after
   that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle and was
   reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and
   dressed in a loose antique costume and sat down on that very bench so
   that i could not see him it was certainly nervous waiting and the
   blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so when eleven struck
   however the old man stood up glided to a massive carved chest in a
   corner and got two hooded cloaks; one of which he donned and the
   other of which he draped round the old woman who was ceasing her
   monotonous spinning then they both started for the outer door; the
   woman lamely creeping and the old man after picking up the very book
   i had been reading beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving
   face or mask

   we went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly
   ancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows
   disappeared one by one and the dog star leered at the throng of
   cowled cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and
   formed monstrous processions up this street and that past the creaking
   signs and antediluvian gables the thatched roofs and diamondpaned
   windows; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped
   and crumbled together; gliding across open courts and churchyards where
   the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations

   amid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides; jostled by
   elbows that seemed preternaturally soft and pressed by chests and
   stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and
   hearing never a word up up up the eery columns slithered and i saw
   that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of
   focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the
   town where perched a great white church i had seen it from the roads
   crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk and it had made me
   shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the
   ghostly spire

   there was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with
   spectral shafts and partly a halfpaved square swept nearly bare of
   snow by the wind and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having
   peaked roofs and overhanging gables deathfires danced over the tombs
   revealing gruesome vistas though queerly failing to cast any shadows
   past the churchyard where there were no houses i could see over the
   hills summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour though the
   town was invisible in the dark only once in a while a lantern bobbed
   horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng
   that was now slipping speechlessly into the church i waited till the
   crowd had oozed into the black doorway and till all the stragglers had
   followed the old man was pulling at my sleeve but i was determined to
   be the last crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown
   darkness i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard
   phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement and as i
   did so i shuddered for though the wind had not left much snow a few
   patches did remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting
   backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of
   passing feet not even mine

   the church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it
   for most of the throng had already vanished they had streamed up the
   aisle between the high pews to the trapdoor of the vaults which yawned
   loathsomely open just before the pulpit and were now squirming
   noiselessly in i followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the
   dark suffocating crypt the tail of that sinuous line of
   nightmarchers seemed very horrible and as i saw them wriggling into a
   venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still then i noticed that the
   tombs floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding and in
   a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of roughhewn
   stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous that
   wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls
   of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar it was a silent
   shocking descent and i observed after a horrible interval that the
   walls and steps were changing in nature as if chiselled out of the
   solid rock what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made
   no sound and set up no echoes after more aeons of descent i saw some
   side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to
   this shaft of nighted mystery soon they became excessively numerous
   like impious catacombs of nameless menace; and their pungent odour of
   decay grew quite unbearable i knew we must have passed down through
   the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself and i shivered
   that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil

   then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light and heard the insidious
   lapping of sunless waters again i shivered for i did not like the
   things that the night had brought and wished bitterly that no
   forefather had summoned me to this primal rite as the steps and the
   passage grew broader i heard another sound the thin whining mockery
   of a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the
   boundless vista of an inner worlda vast fungous shore litten by a
   belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river
   that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest
   gulfs of immemorial ocean

   fainting and gasping i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan
   toadstools leprous fire and slimy water and saw the cloaked throngs
   forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar it was the yulerite
   older than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the
   solstice and of springs promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire and
   evergreen light and music and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the
   rite and adore the sick pillar of flame and throw into the water
   handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in
   the chlorotic glare i saw this and i saw something amorphously
   squatted far away from the light piping noisomely on a flute; and as
   the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the
   foetid darkness where i could not see but what frightened me most was
   that flaming column; spouting volcanically from depths profound and
   inconceivable casting no shadows as healthy flame should and coating
   the nitrous stone with a nasty venomous verdigris for in all that
   seething combustion no warmth lay but only the clamminess of death and
   corruption

   the man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the
   hideous flame and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he
   faced at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance
   especially when he held above his head that abhorrent necronomicon he
   had taken with him; and i shared all the obeisances because i had been
   summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers then the
   old man made a signal to the halfseen fluteplayer in the darkness
   which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder
   drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable
   and unexpected at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth
   transfixed with a dread not of this or any world but only of the mad
   spaces between the stars

   out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that
   cold flame out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river
   rolled uncanny unheard and unsuspected there flopped rhythmically a
   horde of tame trained hybrid winged things that no sound eye could
   ever wholly grasp or sound brain ever wholly remember they were not
   altogether crows nor moles nor buzzards nor ants nor vampire bats
   nor decomposed human beings; but something i cannot and must not
   recall they flopped limply along half with their webbed feet and half
   with their membranous wings; and as they reached the throng of
   celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them and rode off one
   by one along the reaches of that unlighted river into pits and
   galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and
   undiscoverable cataracts

   the old spinning woman had gone with the throng and the old man
   remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an
   animal and ride like the rest i saw when i staggered to my feet that
   the amorphous fluteplayer had rolled out of sight but that two of the
   beasts were patiently standing by as i hung back the old man produced
   his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my
   fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place; that it
   had been decreed i should come back and that the most secret mysteries
   were yet to be performed he wrote this in a very ancient hand and
   when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a
   watch both with my family arms to prove that he was what he said but
   it was a hideous proof because i knew from old papers that that watch
   had been buried with my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather in 1698

   presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family
   resemblance in his face but i only shuddered because i was sure that
   the face was merely a devilish waxen mask the flopping animals were
   now scratching restlessly at the lichens and i saw that the old man
   was nearly as restless himself when one of the things began to waddle
   and edge away he turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of
   his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his
   head and then because that nightmares position barred me from the
   stone staircase down which we had come i flung myself into the oily
   underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea; flung
   myself into that putrescent juice of earths inner horrors before the
   madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions
   these pestgulfs might conceal

   at the hospital they told me i had been found halffrozen in kingsport
   harbour at dawn clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to
   save me they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the
   night before and fallen over the cliffs at orange point; a thing they
   deduced from prints found in the snow there was nothing i could say
   because everything was wrong everything was wrong with the broad
   windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was
   ancient and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below
   they insisted that this was kingsport and i could not deny it when i
   went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old
   churchyard on central hill they sent me to st marys hospital in
   arkham where i could have better care i liked it there for the
   doctors were broadminded and even lent me their influence in
   obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazreds objectionable
   necronomicon from the library of miskatonic university they said
   something about a psychosis and agreed i had better get any harassing
   obsessions off my mind

   so i read that hideous chapter and shuddered doubly because it was
   indeed not new to me i had seen it before let footprints tell what
   they might; and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten there
   was no onein waking hourswho could remind me of it; but my dreams
   are filled with terror because of phrases i dare not quote i dare
   quote only one paragraph put into such english as i can make from the
   awkward low latin

   the nethermost caverns wrote the mad arab are not for the
   fathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific
   cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied and
   evil the mind that is held by no head wisely did ibn schacabao say
   that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain and happy the town at
   night whose wizards are all ashes for it is of old rumour that the
   soul of the devilbought hastes not from his charnel clay but fats and
   instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life
   springs and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and
   swell monstrous to plague it great holes secretly are digged where
   earths pores ought to suffice and things have learnt to walk that
   ought to crawl

   theres an ancient ancient garden that i see sometimes in dreams
   where the very maytime sunlight plays and glows with spectral gleams;
   where the gaudytinted blossoms seem to wither into grey
   and the crumbling walls and pillars waken thoughts of yesterday
   there are vines in nooks and crannies and theres moss about the pool
   and the tangled weedy thicket chokes the arbour dark and cool:
   in the silent sunken pathways springs an herbage sparse and spare
   where the musty scent of dead things dulls the fragrance of the air
   there is not a living creature in the lonely space around
   and the hedge~encompassd quiet never echoes to a sound
   as i walk and wait and listen i will often seek to find
   when it was i knew that garden in an age long left behind;
   i will oft conjure a vision of a day that is no more
   as i gaze upon the grey grey scenes i feel i knew before
   then a sadness settles oer me and a tremor seems to start 
   for i know the flowrs are shrivelld hopes  the garden is my heart

   the green meadow  (1927)
   h p lovecraft and winifred v jackson
   written 1918/19 and published in the spring of 1927 in the vagrant pp
   18895 excerpted from the green meadow on wikipedia the free
   encyclopedia

   (introductory note: the following very singular narrative or record of
   impressions was discovered under circumstances so extraordinary that
   they deserve careful description on the evening of wednesday august
   27 1913 at about eightthirty oclock the population of the small
   seaside village of potowonket maine usa was aroused by a
   thunderous report accompanied by a blinding flash; and persons near the
   shore beheld a mammoth ball of fire dart from the heavens into the sea
   but a short distance out sending up a prodigious column of water the
   following sunday a fishing party composed of john richmond peter b
   carr and simon canfield caught in their trawl and dragged ashore a
   mass of metallic rock weighing 360 pounds and looking (as mr
   canfield said) like a piece of slag most of the inhabitants agreed
   that this heavy body was none other than the fireball which had fallen
   from the sky four days before; and dr richard m jones the local
   scientific authority allowed that it must be an aerolite or meteoric
   stone in chipping off specimens to send to an expert boston analyst
   dr jones discovered imbedded in the semimetallic mass the strange
   book containing the ensuing tale which is still in his possession
         in form the discovery resembles an ordinary notebook about 5 x
   3 inches in size and containing thirty leaves in material however it
   presents marked peculiarities the covers are apparently of some dark
   stony substance unknown to geologists and unbreakable by any
   mechanical means no chemical reagent seems to act upon them the
   leaves are much the same save that they are lighter in colour and so
   infinitely thin as to be quite flexible the whole is bound by some
   process not very clear to those who have observed it; a process
   involving the adhesion of the leaf substance to the cover substance
   these substances cannot now be separated nor can the leaves be torn by
   any amount of force the writing is greek of the purest classical
   quality and several students of palaeography declare that the
   characters are in a cursive hand used about the second century b c
   there is little in the text to determine the date the mechanical mode
   of writing cannot be deduced beyond the fact that it must have
   resembled that of the modern slate and slatepencil during the course
   of analytical efforts made by the late professor chambers of harvard
   several pages mostly at the conclusion of the narrative were blurred
   to the point of utter effacement before being read; a circumstance
   forming a wellnigh irreparable loss what remains of the contents was
   done into modern greek letters by the palaeographer rutherford and in
   this form submitted to the translators
         professor mayfield of the massachusetts institute of technology
   who examined samples of the strange stone declares it a true
   meteorite; an opinion in which dr von winterfeldt of heidelberg
   (interned in 1918 as a dangerous enemy alien) does not concur
   professor bradley of columbia college adopts a less dogmatic ground;
   pointing out that certain utterly unknown ingredients are present in
   large quantities and warning that no classification is as yet
   possible
         the presence nature and message of the strange book form so
   momentous a problem that no explanation can even be attempted the
   text as far as preserved is here rendered as literally as our
   language permits in the hope that some reader may eventually hit upon
   an interpretation and solve one of the greatest scientific mysteries of
   recent years)
   it was a narrow place and i was alone on one side beyond a margin of
   vivid waving green was the sea; blue; bright and billowy and
   sending up vaporous exhalations which intoxicated me so profuse
   indeed were these exhalations that they gave me an odd impression of
   a coalescence of sea and sky; for the heavens were likewise bright and
   blue on the other side was the forest ancient almost as the sea
   itself and stretching infinitely inland it was very dark for the
   trees were grotesquely huge and luxuriant and incredibly numerous
   their giant trunks were of a horrible green which blended weirdly with
   the narrow green tract whereon i stood at some distance away on
   either side of me the strange forest extended down to the waters
   edge obliterating the shore line and completely hemming in the narrow
   tract some of the trees i observed stood in the water itself; as
   though impatient of any barrier to their progress
         i saw no living thing nor sign that any living thing save myself
   had ever existed the sea and the sky and the wood encircled me and
   reached off into regions beyond my imagination nor was there any sound
   save of the windtossed wood and of the sea
         as i stood in this silent place i suddenly commenced to tremble;
   for though i knew not how i came there and could scarce remember what
   my name and rank had been i felt that i should go mad if i could
   understand what lurked about me i recalled things i had learned
   things i had dreamed things i had imagined and yearned for in some
   other distant life i thought of long nights when i had gazed up at the
   stars of heaven and cursed the gods that my free soul could not
   traverse the vast abysses which were inaccessible to my body i
   conjured up ancient blasphemies and terrible delvings into the papri
   of democritus; but as memories appeared i shuddered in deeper fear
   for i knew that i was alone  horribly alone alone yet close to
   sentient impulses of vast vague kind; which i prayed never to
   comprehend nor encounter in the voice of the swaying green branches i
   fancied i could detect a kind of malignant hatred and demoniac triumph
   sometimes they struck me as being in horrible colloquy with ghastly and
   unthinkable things which the scaly green bodies of the trees halfhid;
   hid from sight but not from consciousness the most oppressive of my
   sensations was a sinister feeling of alienage though i saw about me
   objects which i could name; trees grass sea and sky; i felt that
   their relation to me was not the same as that of the trees grass sea
   and sky i knew in another and dimly remembered life the nature of the
   difference i could not tell yet i shook in stark fright as it
   impressed itself upon me
         and then in a spot where i had before discerned nothing but the
   misty sea i beheld the green meadow; separated from me by a vast
   expanse of blue rippling water with suntipped wavelets yet strangely
   near often i would peep fearfully over my right shoulder at the trees
   but i preferred to look at the green meadow which affected me oddly
         it was while my eyes were fixed upon this singular tract that i
   first felt the ground in motion beneath me beginning with a kind of
   throbbing agitation which held a fiendish suggestion of conscious
   action the bit of bank on which i stood detached itself from the
   grassy shore and commenced to float away; borne slowly onward as if by
   some current of resistless force i did not move astonished and
   startled as i was by the unprecedented phenomenon; but stood rigidly
   still until a wide lane of water yawned betwixt me and the land of
   trees then i sat down in a sort of daze and again looked at the
   suntipped water and the green meadow
         behind me the trees and the things they may have been hiding
   seemed to radiate infinite menace this i knew without turning to view
   them for as i grew more used to the scene i became less and less
   dependent upon the five senses that once had been my sole reliance i
   knew the green scaly forest hated me yet now i was safe from it for
   my bit of bank had drifted far from the shore
         but though one peril was past another loomed up before me
   pieces of earth were constantly crumbling from the floating isle which
   held me so that death could not be far distant in any event yet even
   then i seemed to sense that death would be death to me no more for i
   turned again to watch the green meadow imbued with a curious feeling
   of security in strange contrast to my general horror
         then it was that i heard at a distance immeasurable the sound
   of falling water not that of any trival cascade such as i had known
   but that which might be heard in the far scythian lands if all the
   mediterranean were poured down an unfathomable abyss it was toward
   this sound that my shrinking island was drifting yet i was content
         far in the rear were happening weird and terrible things; things
   which i turned to view yet shivered to behold for in the sky dark
   vaporous forms hovered fantastically brooding over trees and seeming
   to answer the challenge of the waving green branches then a thick mist
   arose from the sea to join the skyforms and the shore was erased from
   my sight though the sun  what sun i knew not  shone brightly on the
   water around me the land i had left seemed involved in a demoniac
   tempest where dashed the will of the hellish trees and what they hid
   with that of the sky and the sea and when the mist vanished i saw
   only the blue sky and the blue sea for the land and the trees were no
   more
         it was at this point that my attention was arrested by the
   singing in the green meadow hitherto as i have said i had
   encountered no sign of human life; but now there arose to my ears a
   dull chant whose origin and nature were apparently unmistakable while
   the words were utterly undistinguishable the chant awaked in me a
   peculiar train of associations; and i was reminded of some vaguely
   disquieting lines i had once translated out of an egyptian book which
   in turn were taken from a papyrus of ancient meroe through my brain
   ran lines that i fear to repeat; lines telling of very antique things
   and forms of life in the days when our earth was exceeding young of
   things which thought and moved and were alive yet which gods and men
   would not consider alive it was a strange book
         as i listened i became gradually conscious of a circumstance
   which had before puzzled me only subconsciously at no time had my
   sight distinguished any definite objects in the green meadow an
   impression of vivid homogeneous verdure being the sum total of my
   perception now however i saw that the current would cause my island
   to pass the shore at but a little distance; so that i might learn more
   of the land and of the singing thereon my curiosity to behold the
   singers had mounted high though it was mingled with apprehension
         bits of sod continued to break away from the tiny tract which
   carried me but i heeded not their loss; for i felt that i was not to
   die with the body (or appearance of a body) which i seemed to possess
   that everything about me even life and death was illusory; that i had
   overleaped the bounds of mortality and corporeal entity becoming a
   free detached thing; impressed me as almost certain of my location i
   knew nothing save that i felt i could not be on the earthplanet once
   so familiar to me my sensations apart from a kind of haunting terror
   were those of a traveller just embarked upon an unending voyage of
   discovery for a moment i thought of the lands and persons i had left
   behind; and of strange ways whereby i might some day tell them of my
   adventurings even though i might never return
         i had now floated very near the green meadow so that the voices
   were clear and distinct; but though i knew many languages i could not
   quite interpret the words of the chanting familiar they indeed were
   as i had subtly felt when at a greater distance but beyond a sensation
   of vague and awesome remembrance i could make nothing of them a most
   extraordinary quality in the voicesa quality which i cannot
   describeat once frightened and fascinated me my eyes could now
   discern several things amidst the omnipresent verdurerocks covered
   with i bright green moss shrubs of considerable height and less
   definable shapes of great magnitude which seemed to move or vibrate
   amidst the shrubbery in a peculiar way the chanting whose authors i
   was so anxious to glimpse seemed loudest at points where these shapes
   were most numerous and most vigorously in motion

   and then as my island drifted closer and the sound of the distant
   waterfall grew louder i saw clearly the source of the chanting and in
   one horrible instant remembered everything of such things i cannot
   dare not tell for therein was revealed the hideous solution of all
   which had puzzled me; and that solution would drive you mad even as it
   almost drove me i knew now the change through which i had passed
   and through which certain others who once were men had passed! and i
   knew the endless cycle of the future which none like me may escape i
   shall live forever be conscious forever though my soul cries out to
   the gods for the boon of death and oblivion all is before me: beyond
   the deafening torrent lies the land of stethelos where young men are
   infinitely old the green meadow i will send a message across the
   horrible immeasurable abyss

   nemesis

   cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief
   that robert blake was killed by lightning or by some profound nervous
   shock derived from an electrical discharge it is true that the window
   he faced was unbroken but nature has shown herself capable of many
   freakish performances the expression on his face may easily have
   arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw
   while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic
   imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old
   matters he had uncovered as for the anomalous conditions at the
   deserted church of federal hillthe shrewd analyst is not slow in
   attributing them to some charlatanry conscious or unconscious with at
   least some of which blake was secretly connected

   for after all the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to
   the field of myth dream terror and superstition and avid in his
   quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre spectral sort his earlier
   stay in the citya visit to a strange old man as deeply given to
   occult and forbidden lore as hehad ended amidst death and flame and
   it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his
   home in milwaukee he may have known of the old stories despite his
   statements to the contrary in the diary and his death may have nipped
   in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection

   among those however who have examined and correlated all this
   evidence there remain several who cling to less rational and
   commonplace theories they are inclined to take much of blakes diary
   at its face value and point significantly to certain facts such as the
   undoubted genuineness of the old church record the verified existence
   of the disliked and unorthodox starry wisdom sect prior to 1877 the
   recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named edwin m
   lillibridge in 1893 andabove allthe look of monstrous
   transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died it was
   one of these believers who moved to fanatical extremes threw into the
   bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box
   found in the old church steeplethe black windowless steeple and not
   the tower where blakes diary said those things originally were though
   widely censured both officially and unofficially this mana reputable
   physician with a taste for odd folkloreaverred that he had rid the
   earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it

   between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself
   the papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle
   leaving for others the drawing of the picture as robert blake saw
   itor thought he saw itor pretended to see it now studying the
   diary closely dispassionately and at leisure let us summarize the
   dark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief
   actor

   young blake returned to providence in the winter of 19345 taking the
   upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off college
   streeton the crest of the great eastward hill near the brown
   university campus and behind the marble john hay library it was a cosy
   and fascinating place in a little garden oasis of villagelike
   antiquity where huge friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient
   shed the square georgian house had a monitor roof classic doorway
   with fan carving smallpaned windows and all the other earmarks of
   early nineteenth century workmanship inside were sixpanelled doors
   wide floorboards a curving colonial staircase white adamperiod
   mantels and a rear set of rooms three steps below the general level

   blakes study a large southwest chamber overlooked the front garden
   on one side while its west windowsbefore one of which he had his
   deskfaced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view
   of the lower towns outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that
   flamed behind them on the far horizon were the open countrysides
   purple slopes against these some two miles away rose the spectral
   hump of federal hill bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose
   remote outlines wavered mysteriously taking fantastic forms as the
   smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them blake had a curious
   sense that he was looking upon some unknown ethereal world which might
   or might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter
   it in person

   having sent home for most of his books blake bought some antique
   furniture suitable for his quarters and settled down to write and
   paintliving alone and attending to the simple housework himself his
   studio was in a north attic room where the panes of the monitor roof
   furnished admirable lighting during that first winter he produced five
   of his bestknown short storiesthe burrower beneath the stairs in
   the crypt shaggai in the vale of pnath and the feaster from
   the starsand painted seven canvases; studies of nameless unhuman
   monsters and profoundly alien nonterrestrial landscapes

   at sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the
   outspread westthe dark towers of memorial hall just below the
   georgian courthouse belfry the lofty pinnacles of the downtown
   section and that shimmering spirecrowned mound in the distance whose
   unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy
   from his few local acquaintances he learned that the faroff slope was
   a vast italian quarter though most of the houses were remnants of
   older yankee and irish days now and then he would train his
   fieldglasses on that spectral unreachable world beyond the curling
   smoke; picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples and
   speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house
   even with optical aid federal hill seemed somehow alien half fabulous
   and linked to the unreal intangible marvels of blakes own tales and
   pictures the feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into
   the violet lampstarred twilight and the courthouse floodlights and
   the red industrial trust beacon had blazed up to make the night
   grotesque

   of all the distant objects on federal hill a certain huge dark church
   most fascinated blake it stood out with especial distinctness at
   certain hours of the day and at sunset the great tower and tapering
   steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky it seemed to rest on
   especially high ground; for the grimy façade and the obliquely seen
   north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows
   rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and
   chimneypots peculiarly grim and austere it appeared to be built of
   stone stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and
   more the style so far as the glass could show was that earliest
   experimental form of gothic revival which preceded the stately upjohn
   period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the
   georgian age perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815

   as months passed blake watched the faroff forbidding structure with
   an oddly mounting interest since the vast windows were never lighted
   he knew that it must be vacant the longer he watched the more his
   imagination worked till at length he began to fancy curious things he
   believed that a vague singular aura of desolation hovered over the
   place so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves
   around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of
   birds but here they never rested at least that is what he thought
   and set down in his diary he pointed the place out to several friends
   but none of them had even been on federal hill or possessed the
   faintest notion of what the church was or had been

   in the spring a deep restlessness gripped blake he had begun his
   longplanned novelbased on a supposed survival of the witchcult in
   mainebut was strangely unable to make progress with it more and more
   he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and
   the black frowning steeple shunned by the birds when the delicate
   leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new
   beauty but blakes restlessness was merely increased it was then that
   he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that
   fabulous slope into the smokewreathed world of dream

   late in april just before the aeonshadowed walpurgis time blake made
   his first trip into the unknown plodding through the endless downtown
   streets and the bleak decayed squares beyond he came finally upon the
   ascending avenue of centuryworn steps sagging doric porches and
   blearpaned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the longknown
   unreachable world beyond the mists there were dingy blueandwhite
   street signs which meant nothing to him and presently he noted the
   strange dark faces of the drifting crowds and the foreign signs over
   curious shops in brown decadeweathered buildings nowhere could he
   find any of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he
   half fancied that the federal hill of that distant view was a
   dreamworld never to be trod by living human feet

   now and then a battered church façade or crumbling spire came in sight
   but never the blackened pile that he sought when he asked a shopkeeper
   about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head though he
   spoke english freely as blake climbed higher the region seemed
   stranger and stranger with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys
   leading eternally off to the south he crossed two or three broad
   avenues and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower again he asked
   a merchant about the massive church of stone and this time he could
   have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned the dark mans face
   had a look of fear which he tried to hide and blake saw him make a
   curious sign with his right hand

   then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his
   left above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly
   alleys blake knew at once what it was and plunged toward it through
   the squalid unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue twice he lost
   his way but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or
   housewives who sat on their doorsteps or any of the children who
   shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes

   at last he saw the tower plain against the southwest and a huge stone
   bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley presently he stood in a
   windswept open square quaintly cobblestoned with a high bank wall on
   the farther side this was the end of his quest; for upon the wide
   ironrailed weedgrown plateau which the wall supporteda separate
   lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streetsthere
   stood a grim titan bulk whose identity despite blakes new
   perspective was beyond dispute

   the vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude some of the high
   stone buttresses had fallen and several delicate finials lay half lost
   among the brown neglected weeds and grasses the sooty gothic windows
   were largely unbroken though many of the stone mullions were missing
   blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so
   well in view of the known habits of small boys the world over the
   massive doors were intact and tightly closed around the top of the
   bank wall fully enclosing the grounds was a rusty iron fence whose
   gateat the head of a flight of steps from the squarewas visibly
   padlocked the path from the gate to the building was completely
   overgrown desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place and
   in the birdless eaves and black ivyless walls blake felt a touch of
   the dimly sinister beyond his power to define

   there were very few people in the square but blake saw a policeman at
   the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church
   he was a great wholesome irishman and it seemed odd that he would do
   little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people
   never spoke of that building when blake pressed him he said very
   hurriedly that the italian priest warned everybody against it vowing
   that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark he
   himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father who recalled
   certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood

   there had been a bad sect there in the old daysan outlaw sect that
   called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night it had taken a
   good priest to exorcise what had come though there did be those who
   said that merely the light could do it if father omalley were alive
   there would be many a thing he could tell but now there was nothing to
   do but let it alone it hurt nobody now and those that owned it were
   dead or far away they had run away like rats after the threatening
   talk in 77 when people began to mind the way folks vanished now and
   then in the neighbourhood some day the city would step in and take the
   property for lack of heirs but little good would come of anybodys
   touching it better it be left alone for the years to topple lest
   things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss

   after the policeman had gone blake stood staring at the sullen steepled
   pile it excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to
   others as to him and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind
   the old tales the bluecoat had repeated probably they were mere
   legends evoked by the evil look of the place but even so they were
   like a strange coming to life of one of his own stories

   the afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds but seemed
   unable to light up the stained sooty walls of the old temple that
   towered on its high plateau it was odd that the green of spring had
   not touched the brown withered growths in the raised ironfenced
   yard blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining
   the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress there
   was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be
   resisted the fence had no opening near the steps but round on the
   north side were some missing bars he could go up the steps and walk
   round on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap
   if the people feared the place so wildly he would encounter no
   interference

   he was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone
   noticed him then looking down he saw the few people in the square
   edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the
   shopkeeper in the avenue had made several windows were slammed down
   and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children
   inside a rickety unpainted house the gap in the fence was very easy
   to pass through and before long blake found himself wading amidst the
   rotting tangled growths of the deserted yard here and there the worn
   stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in the
   field; but that he saw must have been very long ago the sheer bulk
   of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it but he
   conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the
   façade all were securely locked so he began a circuit of the
   cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening
   even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of
   desertion and shadow yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on
   automatically

   a yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the
   needed aperture peering in blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and
   dust faintly litten by the western suns filtered rays debris old
   barrels and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye
   though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp
   outlines the rusted remains of a hotair furnace showed that the
   building had been used and kept in shape as late as midvictorian
   times

   acting almost without conscious initiative blake crawled through the
   window and let himself down to the dustcarpeted and debrisstrewn
   concrete floor the vaulted cellar was a vast one without partitions;
   and in a corner far to the right amid dense shadows he saw a black
   archway evidently leading upstairs he felt a peculiar sense of
   oppression at being actually within the great spectral building but
   kept it in check as he cautiously scouted aboutfinding a stillintact
   barrel amid the dust and rolling it over to the open window to provide
   for his exit then bracing himself he crossed the wide
   cobwebfestooned space toward the arch halfchoked with the
   omnipresent dust and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres he reached
   and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness
   he had no light but groped carefully with his hands after a sharp
   turn he felt a closed door ahead and a little fumbling revealed its
   ancient latch it opened inward and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined
   corridor lined with wormeaten panelling

   once on the ground floor blake began exploring in a rapid fashion all
   the inner doors were unlocked so that he freely passed from room to
   room the colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its driffs
   and mountains of dust over box pews altar hourglass pulpit and
   soundingboard and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the
   pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered gothic
   columns over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light
   as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange
   halfblackened panes of the great apsidal windows

   the paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that blake
   could scarcely decipher what they had represented but from the little
   he could make out he did not like them the designs were largely
   conventional and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much
   concerning some of the ancient patterns the few saints depicted bore
   expressions distinctly open to criticism while one of the windows
   seemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity
   scattered about in it turning away from the windows blake noticed
   that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind
   but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy egypt

   in a rear vestry room beside the apse blake found a rotting desk and
   ceilinghigh shelves of mildewed disintegrating books here for the
   first time he received a positive shock of objective horror for the
   titles of those books told him much they were the black forbidden
   things which most sane people have never even heard of or have heard
   of only in furtive timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded
   repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have
   trickled down the stream of time from the days of mans youth and the
   dim fabulous days before man was he had himself read many of thema
   latin version of the abhorred necronomicon the sinister liber ivonis
   the infamous cultes des goules of comte derlette the
   unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt and old ludvig prinns hellish
   de vermis mysteriis but there were others he had known merely by
   reputation or not at allthe pnakotic manuscripts the book of dzyan
   and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable characters yet with
   certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognizable to the occult
   student clearly the lingering local rumours had not lied this place
   had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the
   known universe

   in the ruined desk was a small leatherbound recordbook filled with
   entries in some odd cryptographic medium the manuscript writing
   consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and
   anciently in alchemy astrology and other dubious artsthe devices of
   the sun moon planets aspects and zodiacal signshere massed in
   solid pages of text with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that
   each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter

   in the hope of later solving the cryptogram blake bore off this volume
   in his coat pocket many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated
   him unutterably and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time
   he wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long was he
   the first to conquer the clutching pervasive fear which had for nearly
   sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors?

   having now thoroughly explored the ground floor blake ploughed again
   through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule where he
   had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened
   tower and steepleobjects so long familiar to him at a distance the
   ascent was a choking experience for dust lay thick while the spiders
   had done their worst in this constricted place the staircase was a
   spiral with high narrow wooden treads and now and then blake passed a
   clouded window looking dizzily out over the city though he had seen no
   ropes below he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower
   whose narrow louvreboarded lancet windows his fieldglass had studied
   so often here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained
   the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes and
   clearly devoted to vastly different purposes

   the room about fifteen feet square was faintly lighted by four lancet
   windows one on each side which were glazed within their screening of
   decayed louvreboards these had been further fitted with tight opaque
   screens but the latter were now largely rotted away in the centre of
   the dustladen floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four
   feet in height and two in average diameter covered on each side with
   bizarre crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs on this
   pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged
   lid thrown back and its interior holding what looked beneath the
   decadedeep dust to be an eggshaped or irregularly spherical object
   some four inches through around the pillar in a rough circle were
   seven highbacked gothic chairs still largely intact while behind
   them ranging along the darkpanelled walls were seven colossal images
   of crumbling blackpainted plaster resembling more than anything else
   the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious easter island in one corner
   of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall leading up
   to the closed trap door of the windowless steeple above

   as blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd basreliefs
   on the strange open box of yellowish metal approaching he tried to
   clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief and saw that the
   figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting
   entities which though seemingly alive resembled no known lifeform
   ever evolved on this planet the fourinch seeming sphere turned out to
   be a nearly black redstriated polyhedron with many irregular flat
   surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an
   artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter it did
   not touch the bottom of the box but was held suspended by means of a
   metal band around its centre with seven queerlydesigned supports
   extending horizontally to angles of the boxs inner wall near the top
   this stone once exposed exerted upon blake an almost alarming
   fascination he could scarcely tear his eyes from it and as he looked
   at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent with
   halfformed worlds of wonder within into his mind floated pictures of
   alien orbs with great stone towers and other orbs with titan mountains
   and no mark of life and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in
   vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will

   when he did look away it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of
   dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple just why it took
   his attention he could not tell but something in its contours carried
   a message to his unconscious mind ploughing toward it and brushing
   aside the hanging cobwebs as he went he began to discern something
   grim about it hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth and blake
   gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions it was a human skeleton
   and it must have been there for a very long time the clothing was in
   shreds but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a mans grey
   suit there were other bits of evidenceshoes metal clasps huge
   buttons for round cuffs a stickpin of bygone pattern a reporters
   badge with the name of the old providence telegram and a crumbling
   leather pocketbook blake examined the latter with care finding within
   it several bills of antiquated issue a celluloid advertising calendar
   for 1893 some cards with the name edwin m lillibridge and a paper
   covered with pencilled memoranda

   this paper held much of a puzzling nature and blake read it carefully
   at the dim westward window its disjointed text included such phrases
   as the following:

   restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his
   coat blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust the
   implications of the notes were clear and there could be no doubt but
   that this man had come to the deserted edifice fortytwo years before
   in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold
   enough to attempt perhaps no one else had known of his planwho could
   tell? but he had never returned to his paper had some
   bravelysuppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden
   heartfailure? blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their
   peculiar state some of them were badly scattered and a few seemed
   oddly dissolved at the ends others were strangely yellowed with vague
   suggestions of charring this charring extended to some of the
   fragments of clothing the skull was in a very peculiar statestained
   yellow and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid
   had eaten through the solid bone what had happened to the skeleton
   during its four decades of silent entombment here blake could not
   imagine

   before he realized it he was looking at the stone again and letting
   its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind he saw
   processions of robed hooded figures whose outlines were not human and
   looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved skyreaching
   monoliths he saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea and
   vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin
   shimmerings of cold purple haze and beyond all else he glimpsed an
   infinite gulf of darkness where solid and semisolid forms were known
   only by their windy stirrings and cloudy patterns of force seemed to
   superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes
   and arcana of the worlds we know

   then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing
   indeterminate panic fear blake choked and turned away from the stone
   conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him
   with horrible intentness he felt entangled with somethingsomething
   which was not in the stone but which had looked through it at
   himsomething which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that
   was not physical sight plainly the place was getting on his
   nervesas well it might in view of his gruesome find the light was
   waning too and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would
   have to be leaving soon

   it was then in the gathering twilight that he thought he saw a faint
   trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone he had tried to look
   away from it but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back was there
   a subtle phosphorescence of radioactivity about the thing? what was it
   that the dead mans notes had said concerning a shining trapezohedron?
   what anyway was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? what had been
   done here and what might still be lurking in the birdshunned shadows?
   it seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere
   close by though its source was not apparent blake seized the cover of
   the longopen box and snapped it down it moved easily on its alien
   hinges and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stone

   at the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come
   from the steeples eternal blackness overhead beyond the trapdoor
   rats without questionthe only living things to reveal their presence
   in this accursed pile since he had entered it and yet that stirring in
   the steeple frightened him horribly so that he plunged almost wildly
   down the spiral stairs across the ghoulish nave into the vaulted
   basement out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square and
   down through the teeming fearhaunted alleys and avenues of federal
   hill towards the sane central streets and the homelike brick sidewalks
   of the college district

   during the days which followed blake told no one of his expedition
   instead he read much in certain books examined long years of
   newspaper files downtown and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in
   that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room the cipher he soon
   saw was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt
   sure that its language could not be english latin greek french
   spanish italian or german evidently he would have to draw upon the
   deepest wells of his strange erudition

   every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned and he saw
   the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant
   and halffabulous world but now it held a fresh note of terror for
   him he knew the heritage of evil lore it masked and with the
   knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways the birds of spring
   were returning and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they
   avoided the gaunt lone spire as never before when a flock of them
   approached it he thought they would wheel and scatter in panic
   confusionand he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to
   reach him across the intervening miles

   it was in june that blakes diary told of his victory over the
   cryptogram the text was he found in the dark aklo language used by
   certain cults of evil antiquity and known to him in a halting way
   through previous researches the diary is strangely reticent about what
   blake deciphered but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his
   results there are references to a haunter of the dark awaked by gazing
   into the shining trapezohedron and insane conjectures about the black
   gulfs of chaos from which it was called the being is spoken of as
   holding all knowledge and demanding monstrous sacrifices some of
   blakes entries show fear lest the thing which he seemed to regard as
   summoned stalk abroad; though he adds that the streetlights form a
   bulwark which cannot be crossed

   of the shining trapezohedron he speaks often calling it a window on
   all time and space and tracing its history from the days it was
   fashioned on dark yuggoth before ever the old ones brought it to
   earth it was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid
   things of antarctica salvaged from their ruins by the serpentmen of
   valusia and peered at aeons later in lemuria by the first human
   beings it crossed strange lands and stranger seas and sank with
   atlantis before a minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to
   swarthy merchants from nighted khem the pharaoh nephrenka built
   around it a temple with a windowless crypt and did that which caused
   his name to be stricken from all monuments and records then it slept
   in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new pharaoh
   destroyed till the delvers spade once more brought it forth to curse
   mankind

   early in july the newspapers oddly supplement blakes entries though
   in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general
   attention to their contribution it appears that a new fear had been
   growing on federal hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded
   church the italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings
   and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple and called on their
   priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams something they
   said was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough
   to venture forth press items mentioned the longstanding local
   superstitions but failed to shed much light on the earlier background
   of the horror it was obvious that the young reporters of today are no
   antiquarians in writing of these things in his diary blake expresses
   a curious kind of remorse and talks of the duty of burying the shining
   trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight
   into the hideous jutting spire at the same time however he displays
   the dangerous extent of his fascination and admits a morbid
   longingpervading even his dreamsto visit the accursed tower and
   gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone

   then something in the journal on the morning of 17 july threw the
   diarist into a veritable fever of horror it was only a variant of the
   other halfhumorous items about the federal hill restlessness but to
   blake it was somehow very terrible indeed in the night a thunderstorm
   had put the citys lightingsystem out of commission for a full hour
   and in that black interval the italians had nearly gone mad with
   fright those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing
   in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps absence and
   gone down into the body of the church flopping and bumping around in a
   viscous altogether dreadful way towards the last it had bumped up to
   the tower where there were sounds of the shattering of glass it could
   go wherever the darkness reached but light would always send it
   fleeing

   when the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in
   the tower for even the feeble light trickling through the
   grimeblackened louvreboarded windows was too much for the thing it
   had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in
   timefor a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss
   whence the crazy stranger had called it during the dark hour praying
   crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles
   and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellasa guard of
   light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness
   once those nearest the church declared the outer door had rattled
   hideously

   but even this was not the worst that evening in the bulletin blake
   read of what the reporters had found aroused at last to the whimsical
   news value of the scare a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds
   of italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after
   trying the doors in vain they found the dust of the vestibule and of
   the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way with bits of rotted
   cushions and satin pewlinings scattered curiously around there was a
   bad odour everywhere and here and there were bits of yellow stain and
   patches of what looked like charring opening the door to the tower
   and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above they
   found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean

   in the tower itself a similarly halfswept condition existed they
   spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar the overturned gothic chairs and
   the bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough the metal box and
   the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned what disturbed blake the
   mostexcept for the hints of stains and charring and bad odourswas
   the final detail that explained the crashing glass every one of the
   towers lancet windows was broken and two of them had been darkened in
   a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pewlinings and
   cushionhorsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior
   louvreboards more satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay
   scattered around the newly swept floor as if someone had been
   interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness
   of its tightly curtained days

   yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the
   windowless spire but when a reporter climbed up opened the
   horizontallysliding trapdoor and shot a feeble flashlight beam into
   the black and strangely foetid space he saw nothing but darkness and
   a heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture the
   verdict of course was charlatanry somebody had played a joke on the
   superstitious hilldwellers or else some fanatic had striven to
   bolster up their fears for their own supposed good or perhaps some of
   the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate
   hoax on the outside world there was an amusing aftermath when the
   police sent an officer to verify the reports three men in succession
   found ways of evading the assignment and the fourth went very
   reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given
   by the reporters

   from this point onwards blakes diary shows a mounting tide of
   insidious horror and nervous apprehension he upbraids himself for not
   doing something and speculates wildly on the consequences of another
   electrical breakdown it had been verified that on three
   occasionsduring thunderstormshe telephoned the electric light
   company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against
   a lapse of power be taken now and then his entries show concern over
   the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone and the
   strangely marred old skeleton when they explored the shadowy tower
   room he assumed that these things had been removedwhither and by
   whom or what he could only guess but his worst fears concerned
   himself and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his
   mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeplethat monstrous
   thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black
   spaces he seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will and callers
   of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and
   stare out of the west window at that faroff spirebristling mound
   beyond the swirling smoke of the city his entries dwell monotonously
   on certain terrible dreams and of a strengthening of the unholy
   rapport in his sleep there is mention of a night when he awakened to
   find himself fully dressed outdoors and headed automatically down
   college hill towards the west again and again he dwells on the fact
   that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him

   the week following 30 july is recalled as the time of blakes partial
   breakdown he did not dress and ordered all his food by telephone
   visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed and he said that
   sleepwalking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots
   which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying
   in his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the
   collapse after retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly
   found himself groping about in an almost black space all he could see
   were short faint horizontal streaks of bluish light but he could
   smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft furtive
   sounds above him whenever he moved he stumbled over something and at
   each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from abovea
   vague stirring mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood

   once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top
   whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built
   into the wall and fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some
   region of intenser stench where a hot searing blast beat down against
   him before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played
   all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast
   unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even
   profounder blackness he thought of the ancient legends of ultimate
   chaos at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god azathoth lord of
   all things encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous
   dancers and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute
   held in nameless paws

   then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and
   roused him to the unutterable horror of his position what it was he
   never knewperhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard
   all summer on federal hill as the dwellers hail their various patron
   saints or the saints of their native villages in italy in any event
   he shrieked aloud dropped frantically from the ladder and stumbled
   blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber
   that encompassed him

   he knew instantly where he was and plunged recklessly down the narrow
   spiral staircase tripping and bruising himself at every turn there
   was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly
   arches reached up to realms of leering shadow a sightless scramble
   through a littered basement a climb to regions of air and street
   lights outside and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering
   gables across a grim silent city of tall black towers and up the
   steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door

   on regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his
   study floor fully dressed dirt and cobwebs covered him and every inch
   of his body seemed sore and bruised when he faced the mirror he saw
   that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour
   seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing it was then that his
   nerves broke down thereafter lounging exhaustedly about in a
   dressinggown he did little but stare from his west window shiver at
   the threat of thunder and make wild entries in his diary

   the great storm broke just before midnight on 8 august lightning
   struck repeatedly in all parts of the city and two remarkable
   fireballs were reported the rain was torrential while a constant
   fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands blake was
   utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system and tried to
   telephone the company around 1 am though by that time service had
   been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety he recorded
   everything in his diarythe large nervous and often undecipherable
   hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair and
   of entries scrawled blindly in the dark

   he had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window and it
   appears that most of his time was spent at his desk peering anxiously
   through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the
   constellation of distant lights marking federal hill now and then he
   would fumblingly make an entry in his diary so that detached phrases
   such as the lights must not go; it knows where i am; i must
   destroy it; and it is calling to me but perhaps it means no injury
   this time; are found scattered down two of the pages

   then the lights went out all over the city it happened at 212 am
   according to powerhouse records but blakes diary gives no indication
   of the time the entry is merely lights outgod help me on federal
   hill there were watchers as anxious as he and rainsoaked knots of men
   paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with
   umbrellashaded candles electric flashlights oil lanterns
   crucifixes and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern
   italy they blessed each flash of lightning and made cryptical signs
   of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the
   flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether a rising wind blew
   out most of the candles so that the scene grew threateningly dark
   someone roused father merluzzo of spirito santo church and he hastened
   to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could
   of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower there could
   be no doubt whatever

   for what happened at 235 we have the testimony of the priest a young
   intelligent and welleducated person; of patrolman william j monohan
   of the central station an officer of the highest reliability who had
   paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of
   the seventyeight men who had gathered around the churchs high bank
   wallespecially those in the square where the eastward façade was
   visible of course there was nothing which can be proved as being
   outside the order of nature the possible causes of such an event are
   many no one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes
   arising in a vast ancient illaired and longdeserted building of
   heterogeneous contents mephitic vapoursspontaneous
   combustionpressure of gases born of long decayany one of numberless
   phenomena might be responsible and then of course the factor of
   conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded the thing was really
   quite simple in itself and covered less than three minutes of actual
   time father merluzzo always a precise man looked at his watch
   repeatedly

   it started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside
   the black tower there had for some time been a vague exhalation of
   strange evil odours from the church and this had now become emphatic
   and offensive then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a
   large heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning
   easterly façade the tower was invisible now that the candles would not
   burn but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was
   the smokegrimed louvreboarding of that towers east window

   immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from
   the unseen heights choking and sickening the trembling watchers and
   almost prostrating those in the square at the same time the air
   trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings and a sudden
   eastblowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the
   hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas from the crowd nothing
   definite could be seen in the candleless night though some
   upwardlooking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur
   of denser blackness against the inky skysomething like a formless
   cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed towards the east

   that was all the watchers were half numbed with fright awe and
   discomfort and scarcely knew what to do or whether to do anything at
   all not knowing what had happened they did not relax their vigil; and
   a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated
   lightning followed by an earsplitting crash of sound rent the flooded
   heavens half an hour later the rain stopped and in fifteen minutes
   more the street lights sprang on again sending the weary bedraggled
   watchers relievedly back to their homes

   the next days papers gave these matters minor mention in connection
   with the general storm reports it seems that the great lightning flash
   and deafening explosion which followed the federal hill occurrence were
   even more tremendous farther east where a burst of the singular foetor
   was likewise noticed the phenomenon was most marked over college hill
   where the crash awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a
   bewildered round of speculations of those who were already awake only
   a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill or
   noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the
   leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens it was
   agreed that the lone sudden lightningbolt must have struck somewhere
   in this neighbourhood though no trace of its striking could afterwards
   be found a youth in the tau omega fraternity house thought he saw a
   grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary
   flash burst but his observation has not been verified all of the few
   observers however agree as to the violent gust from the west and the
   flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke whilst
   evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is
   equally general

   these points were discussed very carefully because of their probable
   connection with the death of robert blake students in the psi delta
   house whose upper rear windows looked into blakes study noticed the
   blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth
   and wondered what was wrong with the expression when they saw the same
   face in the same position that evening they felt worried and watched
   for the lights to come up in his apartment later they rang the bell of
   the darkened flat and finally had a policeman force the door

   the rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window and when the
   intruders saw the glassy bulging eyes and the marks of stark
   convulsive fright on the twisted features they turned away in sickened
   dismay shortly afterwards the coroners physician made an examination
   and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock or nervous
   tension induced by electrical discharge as the cause of death the
   hideous expression he ignored altogether deeming it a not improbable
   result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such
   abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions he deduced these latter
   qualities from the books paintings and manuscripts found in the
   apartment and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the
   desk blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last and the
   brokenpointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically
   contracted right hand

   the entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed and
   legible only in part from them certain investigators have drawn
   conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict
   but such speculations have little chance for belief among the
   conservative the case of these imaginative theorists has not been
   helped by the action of superstitious doctor dexter who threw the
   curious box and angled stonean object certainly selfluminous as seen
   in the black windowless steeple where it was foundinto the deepest
   channel of narragansett bay excessive imagination and neurotic
   unbalance on blakes part aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone
   cult whose startling traces he had uncovered form the dominant
   interpretation given those final frenzied jottings these are the
   entriesor all that can be made of them:

   there had happened in the teeming and manytowered city of zeth one of
   those incidents which are prone to take place in all capitals of all
   worlds nor simply because zeth lies on a planet of strange beasts and
   stranger vegetation did this incident differ greatly from what might
   have occurred in london or paris or any of the great governing towns we
   know through the cleverly concealed dishonesty of an aged but shrewd
   official the treasury was exhausted no shining phrulder as of old
   lay stacked about the strongroom; and over empty coffers the sardonic
   spider wove webs of mocking design when at last the giphath yalden
   entered that obscure vault and discovered the thefts there were left
   only some phlegmatic rats which peered sharply at him as at an alien
   intruder

   there had been no accountings since kishan the old keeper had died many
   moonturns before and great was yaldens dismay to find this emptiness
   instead of the expected wealth the indifference of the small creatures
   in the cracks between the flagstones could not spread itself to him
   this was a very grave matter and would have to be met in a very prompt
   and serious way clearly there was nothing to do but consult oorn and
   oorn was a highly portentous being

   oorn though a creature of extremely doubtful nature was the virtual
   ruler of zeth it obviously belonged somewhere in the outer abyss but
   had blundered into zeth one night and suffered capture by the shamith
   priests the coincidence of its excessively bizarre aspect and its
   innate gift of mimicry had impressed the sacred brothers as offering
   vast possibilities hence in the end they had set it up as a god and an
   oracle organising a new brotherhood to serve itand incidentally to
   suggest the edicts it should utter and the replies it should give like
   the delphi and dodona of a later world oorn grew famous as a giver of
   judgments and solver of riddles; nor did its essence differ from them
   save that it lay infinitely earlier in time and upon an elder world
   where all things might happen and now yalden being not above the
   credulousness of his day and planet had set out for the closeguarded
   and richlyfitted hall wherein oorn brooded and mimicked the promptings
   of the priests

   when yalden came within sight of the hall with its tower of blue tile
   he became properly religious and entered the building acceptably in a
   humble manner which greatly impeded progress according to custom the
   guardians of the deity acknowledged his obeisance and pecuniary
   offering and retired behind heavy curtains to ignite the thuribles
   after everything was in readiness yalden murmured a conventional
   prayer and bowed low before a curious empty dais studded with exotic
   jewels for a momentas the ritual prescribedhe stayed in this
   abased position and when he arose the dais was no longer empty
   unconcernedly munching something the priests had given it was a large
   pudgy creature very hard to describe and covered with short grey fur
   whence it had come in so brief a time only the priests might tell but
   the suppliant knew that it was oorn

   hesitantly yalden stated his unfortunate mission and asked advice;
   weaving into his discourse the type of flattery which seemed to him
   most discreet then with anxiety he awaited the oracles response
   having tidily finished its food oorn raised three small reddish eyes
   to yalden and uttered certain words in a tone of vast decisiveness:
   gumay ere hfotuol leheht teg after this it vanished suddenly in a
   cloud of pink smoke which seemed to issue from behind the curtain where
   the acolytes were the acolytes then came forth from their hidingplace
   and spoke to yalden saying: since you have pleased the deity with
   your concise statement of a very deplorable state of affairs we are
   honored by interpreting its directions the aphorism you heard
   signifies no less than the equally mystic phrase `go thou unto thy
   destination or more properly speaking you are to slay the
   monsterwizard anathas and replenish the treasury with its fabled
   hoard

   with this yalden was dismissed from the temple it may not be said in
   veracity that he was fearless for in truth he was openly afraid of
   the monster anathas as were all the inhabitants of ullathia and the
   surrounding land even those who doubted its actuality would not have
   chosen to reside in the immediate neighborhood of the cave of three
   winds wherein it was said to dwell

   but the prospect was not without romantic appeal and yalden was young
   and consequently unwise he knew among other things that there was
   always the hope of rescuing some feminine victim of the monsters famed
   and surprising erotic taste of the true aspect of anathas none could
   be certain; tales of a widely opposite nature being commonly
   circulated many vowed it had been seen from afar in the form of a
   giant black shadow peculiarly repugnant to human taste while others
   alleged it was a mound of gelatinous substance that oozed hatefully in
   the manner of putrescent flesh still others claimed they had seen it
   as a monstrous insect with astonishing supernumerary appurtenances but
   in one thing all coincided; namely that it was advisable to have as
   little traffic as possible with anathas

   with due supplications to his gods and to their messenger oorn yalden
   set out for the cave of three winds in his bosom were mixed an
   ingrained patriotic sense of duty and a thrill of adventurous
   expectancy regarding the unknown mysteries he faced he had not
   neglected such preparations as a sensible man might make and a wizard
   of old repute had furnished him with certain singular accessories he
   had for example a charm which prevented his thirsting or hungering
   and wholly did away with his need for provisions there was likewise a
   glistening cape to counteract the evil emanations of a mineral that lay
   scattered over the rocky ground along his course other warnings and
   safeguards dealt with certain gaudy landcrustaceans and with the
   deathlysweet mists which arise at certain points until dispersed by
   heliotropism

   thus shielded yalden fared without incident until he came to the place
   of the white worm here of necessity he delayed to make preparations
   for finding the rest of his way with patient diligence he captured the
   small colorless maggot and surrounded it with a curious mark made with
   green paint as was prophesied the lord of worms whose name was
   sarall made promise of certain things in return for its freedom then
   yalden released it and it crawled away after directing him on the
   course he was to follow

   the sere and fruitless land through which he now travelled was totally
   uninhabited not even the hardier of the beasts were to be seen beyond
   the edge of that final plateau which separated him from his goal far
   off in a purplish haze rose the mountains amidst which dwelt anathas
   it lived not solitary despite the lonely region around for strange
   pets resided with itsome the fabled elder monsters and others unique
   beings created by its own fearful craft

   at the heart of its cave legend said anathas had concealed an
   enormous hoard of jewels gold and other things of fabulous value why
   so potent a wonderworker should care for such gauds or revel in the
   counting of money was by no means clear; but many things attested the
   truth of these tastes great numbers of persons of stronger will and
   wit than yalden had died in remarkable manners while seeking the hoard
   of the wizardbeast and their bones were laid in a strange pattern
   before the mouth of the cave as a warning to others

   when after countless vicissitudes yalden came at last into sight of
   the cave of winds amid the glistening boulders he knew indeed that
   report had not lied concerning the isolation of anathas lair the
   cavernmouth was wellconcealed and over everything an ominous quiet
   lowered there was no trace of habitation save of course the ossuary
   ornamentation in the front yard with his hand on the sword that had
   been sanctified by a priest of oorn yalden tremblingly advanced when
   he had attained the very opening of the lair he hesitated no longer
   for it was evident that the monster was away

   deeming this the best of all times to prosecute his business yalden
   plunged at once within the cave the interior was very cramped and
   exceedingly dirty but the roof glittered with an innumerable array of
   small varicoloured lights the source of which was not to be
   perceived in the rear yawned another opening either natural or
   artificial; and to this black lowarched burrow yalden hastened
   crawling within it on hands and knees before long a faint blue
   radiance glowed at the farther end and presently the searcher emerged
   into an ampler space straightening up he beheld a most singular
   change in his surroundings this second cavern was tall and domed as if
   it had been shapen by supernatural powers and a soft blue and silver
   light infused the gloom anathas thought yalden lived indeed in
   comfort; for this room was finer than anything in the palace of zeth
   or even in the temple of oorn upon which had been lavished unthinkable
   wealth and beauty yalden stood agape but not for long since he
   desired most of all to seek the object of his quest and depart before
   anathas should return from wherever it might be for yalden did not
   wish to encounter the monstersorcerer of which so many tales were
   told leaving therefore this second cave by a narrow cleft which he
   saw the seeker followed a devious and unlit way far down through the
   solid rock of the plateau this he felt would take him to that third
   and ultimate cavern where his business lay as he progressed he
   glimpsed ahead of him a curious glow; and at last without warning the
   walls receded to reveal a vast open space paved solidly with blazing
   coals above which flapped and shrieked an obscene flock of
   wyvernheaded birds over the fiery surface green monstrous salamanders
   slithered eyeing the intruder with malignant speculation and on the
   far side rose the stairs of a metal dais encrusted with jewels and
   piled high with precious objects; the hoard of the wizardbeast

   at sight of this unattainable wealth yaldens fervour wellnigh
   overcame him; and chaffing at his futility he searched the sea of
   flame for some way of crossing this he soon perceived was not
   readily to be found; for in all that glowing crypt there was only a
   slight crescent of flooring near the entrance which a mortal man might
   hope to walk on desperation however possessed him; so that at last
   he resolved to risk all and try the fiery pavement better to die in
   the quest than to return emptyhanded with teeth set he started
   toward the sea of flame heedless of what might follow

   as it was surprise seared him almost as vehemently as he had expected
   the flames to dofor with his advance the glowing floor divided to
   form a narrow lane of safe cool earth leading straight to the golden
   throne half dazed and heedless of whatever might underlie such
   curiously favouring magic yalden drew his sword and strode boldly
   betwixt the walls of flame that rose from the rifted pavement the heat
   hurt him not at all and the wyverncreatures drew back hissing and
   did not molest him

   the hoard now glistened close at hand and yalden thought of how he
   would return to zeth laden with fabulous spoils and worshipped by
   throngs as a hero in his joy he forgot to wonder at anathas lax care
   of its treasures; nor did the very friendly behaviour of the fiery
   pavement seem in any way remarkable even the huge arched opening
   behind the dais so oddly invisible from across the cavern failed to
   disturb him seriously only when he had mounted the broad stair of the
   dais and stood ankledeep amid the bizarre golden reliques of other
   ages and other worlds and the lovely luminous gems from unknown mines
   and of unknown natures and meanings did yalden begin to realise that
   anything was wrong

   but now he perceived that the miraculous passage through the flaming
   floor was closing again leaving him marooned on the dais with the
   glittering treasure he had sought and when it had fully closed and
   his eyes had circled round vainly for some way of escape he was hardly
   reassured by the shapeless jellylike shadow which loomed colossal and
   stinking in the great archway behind the dais he was not permitted to
   faint but was forced to observe that this shadow was infinitely more
   hideous than anything hinted in any popular legend and that its seven
   iridescent eyes were regarding him with placid amusement

   then anathas the wizardbeast rolled fully out of the archway mighty
   in necromantic horror and jested with the small frightened conqueror
   before allowing that horde of slavering and peculiarly hungry green
   salamanders to complete their slow anticipatory ascent of the dais

   i have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the
   horror at martins beach despite the large number of witnesses no two
   accounts agree; and the testimony taken by local authorities contains
   the most amazing discrepancies

   perhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheardof character of
   the horror itself the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it and
   the efforts made by the fashionable wavecrest inn to hush it up after
   the publicity created by prof ahons article are hypnotic powers
   confined to recognized humanity?

   against all these obstacles i am striving to present a coherent
   version; for i beheld the hideous occurrence and believe it should be
   known in view of the appalling possibilities it suggests martins
   beach is once more popular as a wateringplace but i shudder when i
   think of it indeed i cannot look at the ocean at all now without
   shuddering

   fate is not always without a sense of drama and climax hence the
   terrible happening of august 8 1922 swiftly followed a period of
   minor and agreeably wonderfraught excitement at martins beach on may
   17 the crew of the fishing smack alma of gloucester under capt james
   p orne killed after a battle of nearly forty hours a marine monster
   whose size and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific
   circles and caused certain boston naturalists to take every precaution
   for its taxidermic preservation

   the object was some fifty feet in length of roughly cylindrical shape
   and about ten feet in diameter it was unmistakably a gilled fish in
   its major affiliations; but with certain curious modifications such as
   rudimentary forelegs and sixtoed feet in place of pectoral fins which
   prompted the widest speculation its extraordinary mouth its thick and
   scaly hide and its single deepset eye were wonders scarcely less
   remarkable than its colossal dimensions; and when the naturalists
   pronounced it an infant organism which could not have been hatched
   more than a few days public interest mounted to extraordinary heights

   capt orne with typical yankee shrewdness obtained a vessel large
   enough to hold the object in its hull and arranged for the exhibition
   of his prize with judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an
   excellent marine museum and sailing south to the wealthy resort
   district of martins beach anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a
   harvest of admission fees

   the intrinsic marvelousness of the object and the importance which it
   clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and
   far combined to make it the seasons sensation that it was absolutely
   unique  unique to a scientifically revolutionary degree  was well
   understood the naturalists had shown plainly that it radically
   differed from the similarly immense fish caught off the florida coast;
   that while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths
   perhaps thousands of feet its brain and principal organs indicated a
   development startlingly vast and out of all proportion to anything
   hitherto associated with the fish tribe

   on the morning of july 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of
   the vessel and its strange treasure in the storm of the preceding
   night it had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the
   sight of man carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite
   the threatening weather capt orne backed by extensive scientific
   interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from gloucester
   made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise but with no result
   other than the prompting of interest and conversation by august 7 hope
   was abandoned and capt orne had returned to the wavecrest inn to wind
   up his business affairs at martins beach and confer with certain of
   the scientific men who remained there the horror came on august 8

   it was in the twilight when grey seabirds hovered low near the shore
   and a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters
   the scene is important to remember for every impression counts on the
   beach were several strollers and a few late bathers; stragglers from
   the distant cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the
   north or from the adjacent cliffperched inn whose imposing towers
   proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeur

   well within viewing distance was another set of spectators the
   loungers on the inns highceiled and lanternlighted veranda who
   appeared to be enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom
   inside these spectators who included capt orne and his group of
   scientific confreres joined the beach group before the horror
   progressed far; as did many more from the inn certainly there was no
   lack of witnesses confused though their stories be with fear and doubt
   of what they saw

   there is no exact record of the time the thing began although a
   majority say that the fairly round moon was about a foot above the
   lowlying vapors of the horizon they mention the moon because what
   they saw seemed subtly connected with it  a sort of stealthy
   deliberate menacing ripple which rolled in from the far skyline along
   the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams yet which seemed to subside
   before it reached the shore

   many did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events; but it
   seems to have been very marked differing in height and motion from the
   normal waves around it some called it cunning and calculating and as
   it died away craftily by the black reefs afar out there suddenly came
   belching up out of the glitterstreaked brine a cry of death; a scream
   of anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked it

   first to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty;
   sturdy fellows in white bathing attire with their calling proclaimed
   in large red letters across their chests accustomed as they were to
   rescue work and to the screams of the drowning they could find
   nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation; yet with a trained sense
   of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their
   usual course

   hastily seizing an aircushion which with its attached coil of rope
   lay always at hand one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the
   scene of the gathering crowd; whence after whirling it about to gain
   momentum he flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which
   the sound had come as the cushion disappeared in the waves the crowd
   curiously awaited a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been
   so great; eager to see the rescue made by the massive rope

   but that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter;
   for pull as they might on the rope the two muscular guards could not
   move the object at the other end instead they found that object
   pulling with equal or even greater force in the very opposite
   direction till in a few seconds they were dragged off their feet and
   into the water by the strange power which had seized on the proffered
   lifepreserver

   one of them recovering himself called immediately for help from the
   crowd on the shore to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope; and in
   a moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men among whom
   capt orne was foremost more than a dozen strong hands were now
   tugging desperately at the stout line yet wholly without avail

   hard as they tugged the strange force at the other end tugged harder;
   and since neither side relaxed for an instant the rope became rigid as
   steel with the enormous strain the struggling participants as well as
   the spectators were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the
   nature of the force in the sea the idea of a drowning man had long
   been dismissed; and hints of whales submarines monsters and demons
   now passed freely around where humanity had first led the rescuers
   wonder kept them at their task; and they hauled with a grim
   determination to uncover the mystery

   it being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the
   aircushion capt orne as a natural leader shouted to those on shore
   that a boat must be obtained in order to approach harpoon and land
   the unseen leviathan several men at once prepared to scatter in quest
   of a suitable craft while others came to supplant the captain at the
   straining rope since his place was logically with whatever boat party
   might be formed his own idea of the situation was very broad and by
   no means limited to whales since he had to do with a monster so much
   stranger he wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an
   adult of the species of which the fiftyfoot creature had been the
   merest infant

   and now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact
   which changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror and
   dazed with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers capt
   orne turning to leave his post at the rope found his hands held in
   their place with unaccountable strength; and in a moment he realized
   that he was unable to let go of the rope his plight was instantly
   divined and as each companion tested his own situation the same
   condition was encountered the fact could not be denied  every
   struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the
   hempen line which was slowly hideously and relentlessly pulling them
   out to sea

   speechless horror ensued; a horror in which the spectators were
   petrified to utter inaction and mental chaos their complete
   demoralization is reflected in the conflicting accounts they give and
   the sheepish excuses they offer for their seemingly callous inertia i
   was one of them and know

   even the strugglers after a few frantic screams and futile groans
   succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in
   the face of unknown powers there they stood in the pallid moonlight
   blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously
   backward and forward as the water rose first to their knees then to
   their hips the moon went partly under a cloud and in the halflight
   the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede
   writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping death

   harder and harder grew the rope as the tug in both directions
   increased and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the
   rising waves slowly the tide advanced till the sands so lately
   peopled by laughing children and whispering lovers were now swallowed
   by the inexorable flow the herd of panicstricken watchers surged
   blindly backward as the water crept above their feet while the
   frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on half submerged and
   now at a substantial distance from their audience silence was
   complete

   the crowd having gained a huddlingplace beyond reach of the tide
   stared in mute fascination; without offering a word of advice or
   encouragement or attempting any kind of assistance there was in the
   air a nightmare fear of impending evils such as the world had never
   before known

   minutes seemed lengthened into hours and still that human snake of
   swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide rhythmically it
   undulated; slowly horribly with the seal of doom upon it thicker
   clouds now passed over the ascending moon and the glittering path on
   the waters faded nearly out

   very dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads with now and
   then the livid face of a backwardglancing victim gleaming pale in the
   darkness faster and faster gathered the clouds till at length their
   angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame thunders rolled
   softly at first yet soon increasing to a deafening maddening
   intensity then came a culminating crash  a shock whose reverberations
   seemed to shake land and sea alike  and on its heels a cloudburst
   whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the
   heavens themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrent

   the spectators instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious
   and coherent thought now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel
   veranda rumors had reached the guests inside so that the refugees
   found a state of terror nearly equal to their own i think a few
   frightened words were uttered but cannot be sure

   some who were staying at the inn retired in terror to their rooms;
   while others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of
   bobbing heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning
   flashes i recall thinking of those heads and the bulging eyes they
   must contain; eyes that might well reflect all the fright panic and
   delirium of a malignant universe  all the sorrow sin and misery
   blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires fear loathing and anguish of
   the ages since times beginning; eyes alight with all the soulracking
   pain of eternally blazing infernos

   and as i gazed out beyond the heads my fancy conjured up still another
   eye; a single eye equally alight yet with a purpose so revolting to
   my brain that the vision soon passed held in the clutches of an
   unknown vise the line of the damned dragged on; their silent screams
   and unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and
   the nightwind

   there now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic
   sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed amidst a blinding
   glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the
   blasphemies of hell and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated
   in one apocalyptic planetrending peal of cyclopean din it was the
   end of the storm for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the
   moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted sea

   there was no line of bobbing heads now the waters were calm and
   deserted and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a
   whirlpool far out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry
   had first come but as i looked along that treacherous lane of silvery
   sheen with fancy fevered and senses overwrought there trickled upon
   my ears from some abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of
   a laugh

   the horror at red hook

     there are sacraments of evil as well as of good about us and we
     live and move to my belief in an unknown world a place where there
     are caves and shadows and dwellers in twilight it is possible that
     man may sometimes return on the track of evolution and it is my

   when the state highway to rutland is closed travellers are forced to
   take the stillwater road past swamp hollow the scenery is superb in
   places yet somehow the route has been unpopular for years there is
   something depressing about it especially near stillwater itself
   motorists feel subtly uncomfortable about the tightly shuttered
   farmhouse on the knoll just north of the village and about the
   whitebearded halfwit who haunts the old buryingground on the south
   apparently talking to the occupants of some of the graves

   not much is left of stillwater now the soil is played out and most
   of the people have drifted to the towns across the distant river or to
   the city beyond the distant hills the steeple of the old white church
   has fallen down and half of the twentyodd straggling houses are empty
   and in various stages of decay normal life is found only around pecks
   general store and fillingstation and it is here that the curious stop
   now and then to ask about the shuttered house and the idiot who mutters
   to the dead

   most of the questioners come away with a touch of distaste and
   disquiet they find the shabby loungers oddly unpleasant and full of
   unnamed hints in speaking of the longpast events brought up there is
   a menacing portentous quality in the tones which they use to describe
   very ordinary eventsa seemingly unjustified tendency to assume a
   furtive suggestive confidential air and to fall into awesome
   whispers at certain pointswhich insidiously disturbs the listener
   old yankees often talk like that; but in this case the melancholy
   aspect of the halfmouldering village and the dismal nature of the
   story unfolded give these gloomy secretive mannerisms an added
   significance one fells profoundly the quintessential horror that lurks
   behind the isolated puritan and his strange repressionsfeels it and
   longs to escape precipitately into clearer air

   the loungers whisper impressively that the shuttered house is that of
   old miss spraguesophie sprague whose brother tom was buried on the
   seventeenth of june back in 86 sophie was never the same after that
   funeralthat and the other thing which happened the same dayand in
   the end she took to staying in all the time wont even be seen now
   but leaves notes under the backdoor mat and has her things brought
   from the store by ned pecks boy afraid of somethingthe old swamp
   hollow buryingground most of all never could be dragged near there
   since her brotherand the other onewere laid away not much wonder
   though seeing the way crazy johnny dow rants he hangs around the
   buryingground all day and sometimes at night and claims he talks with
   tomand the other then he marches by sophies house and shouts things
   at herthats why she began to keep the shutters closed he says
   things are coming from somewhere to get her sometime ought to be
   stopped but one cant be too hard on poor johnny besides steve
   barbour always had his opinions

   johnny does his talking to two of the graves one of them is tom
   spragues the other at the opposite end of the graveyard is that of
   henry thorndike who was buried on the same day henry was the village
   undertakerthe only one in milesand never liked around stillwater a
   city fellow from rutlandbeen to college and full of book learning
   read queer things nobody else ever heard of and mixed chemicals for no
   good purpose always trying to invent something newsome newfangled
   embalmingfluid or some foolish kind of medicine some folds said he
   had tried to be a doctor but failed in his studies and took to the next
   best profession of course there wasnt much undertaking to do in a
   place like stillwater but henry farmed on the side

   mean morbid dispositionand a secret drinker if you could judge by
   the empty bottles in his rubbish heap no wonder tom sprague hated him
   and blackballed him from the masonic lodge and warned him off when he
   tried to make up to sophie the way he experimented on animals was
   against nature and scripture who could forget the state that collie
   dog was found in or what happened to old mrs akeleys cat? then there
   was the matter of deacon leavitts calf when tom had led a band of the
   village boys to demand an accounting the curious thing was that the
   calf came alive after all in the end though tom had found it as stiff
   as a poker some said the joke was on tom but thorndike probably
   thought otherwise since he had gone down under his enemys fist before
   the mistake was discovered

   tom of course was half drunk at the time he was a vicious brute at
   best and kept his poor sister half cowed with threats thats probably
   why she is such a fearracked creature still there were only the two
   of them and tom would never let her leave because that meant splitting
   the property most of the fellows were too afraid of him to shine up to
   sophiehe stood six feet one in his stockingsbut henry thorndike was
   a sly cuss who had ways of doing things behind folks backs he wasnt
   much to look at but sophie never discouraged him any mean and ugly as
   he was shed have been glad if anybody could have freed her from her
   brother she may not have stopped to wonder how she could get clear of
   him after he got her clear of tom

   well that was the way things stood in june of 86 up to this point
   the whispers of the loungers at pecks store are not to unbearably
   portentous; but as they continue the element of secretiveness and
   malign tension grows tom sprague it appears used to go to rutland on
   periodic sprees his absences being henry thorndikes great
   opportunities he was always in bad shape when he got back and old dr
   pratt deaf and half blind though he was used to warn him about his
   heart and about the danger of delirium tremens folks could always
   tell by the shouting and cursing when he was home again

   it was on the ninth of juneon a wednesday the day after young joshua
   goodenough finished building his newfangled silothat tom started out
   on his last and longest spree he came back the next tuesday morning
   and folks at the store saw him lashing his bay stallion the way he did
   when whiskey had a hold of him then there came shouts and shrieks and
   oaths from the sprague house and the first thing anybody knew sophie
   was running over to old dr pratts at top speed

   the doctor found thorndike at spragues when he got there and tom was
   on the bed in his room with eyes staring and foam around his mouth
   old pratt fumbled around and gave the usual tests then shook his head
   solemnly and told sophie she had suffered a great bereavementthat her
   nearest and dearest had passed through the pearly gates to a better
   land just as everybody knew he would if he didnt let up on his
   drinking

   sophie kind of sniffled but didnt seem to take on much thorndike
   didnt do anything but smileperhaps at the ironic fact that he
   always an enemy was now the only person who could be of any use to
   thomas sprague he shouted something in old dr pratts halfgood ear
   about the need of having the funeral early on account of toms
   condition drunks like that were always doubtful subjects and any
   extra delaywith merely rural facilitieswould entail consequences
   visual and otherwise hardly acceptable to the deceaseds loving
   mourners the doctor had muttered that toms alcoholic career ought to
   have embalmed him pretty well in advance but thorndike assured him to
   the contrary at the same time boasting of his own skill and of the
   superior methods he had devised through his experiments

   it is here that the whispers of the loungers grow acutely disturbing
   up to this point the story is usually told by ezra davenport or luther
   fry if ezra is laid up with chilblains as he is apt to be in winter;
   but from there on old calvin wheeler takes up the thread and his voice
   has a damnably insidious way of suggesting hidden horror if johnny dow
   happens to be passing by there is always a pause for stillwater does
   not like to have johnny talk too much with strangers

   calvin edges close to the traveller and sometimes seizes a coatlapel
   with his gnarled mottled hand while he half shuts his watery blue
   eyes

   well sir he whispers henry he went home an got his undertakers
   fixinscrazy johnny dow lugged most of em for he was always doin
   chores for henryan says as doc pratt an crazy johnny should help
   lay out the body doc always did say as how he thought henry talked too
   muchaboastin what a fine workman he was an how lucky it was that
   stillwater had a reglar undertaker instead of buryin folks jest as
   they was like they do over to whitby

   suppose says he some fellow was to be took with some of them
   paralysin cramps like you read about howd a body like it when they
   lowered him down and begun shovelin the dirt back? howd he like it
   when he was chokin down there under the new headstone scratchin an
   tearin if he chanced to get back the power but all the time knowin
   it wasnt no use? no sir i tell you its a blessin stillwaters got
   a smart doctor as knows when a mans dead and when he aint and a
   trained undertaker who can fix a corpse so hell stay put without no
   trouble

   that was the way henry went on talkin most like he was talkin to
   poor toms remains; and old doc pratt he didnt like what he was able
   to catch of it even though henry did call him a smart doctor crazy
   johnny kept watchin of the corpse and it didnt make it none too
   pleasant the way hed slobber about things like he aint cold doc
   or i see his eyelids move or theres a hole in his arm jest like
   the ones i git when henry gives me a syringe full of what makes me feel
   good thorndike shut him up on that though we all knowed hed been
   givin poor johnny drugs its a wonder the poor fellow ever got clear
   of the habit

   but the worst thing accordin to the doctor was the way the body
   jerked up when henry began to shoot it full of embalminfluid hed
   been boastin about what a fine new formula hed got practicin on cats
   and dogs when all of a sudden toms corpse began to double up like it
   was alive and fixin to wrassle land of goshen but doc says he was
   scared stiff though he knowed the way corpses act when the muscles
   begin to stiffen well sir the long and short of it is that the
   corpse sat up an grabbed a holt of thorndikes syringe so that it got
   stuck in henry hisself an give him as neat a dose of his own
   embalminfluid as youd wish to see that got henry pretty scared
   though he yanked the point out and managed to get the body down again
   and shot full of the fluid he kept measurin more of the stuff out as
   though he wanted to be sure there was enough and kept reassurin
   himself as not much had got into him but crazy johnny begun singin
   out thats what you give lige hopkinss dog when it got all dead an
   stiff an then waked up agin now youre agoing to get dead an stiff
   like tom sprague be! remember it dont set to work till after a long
   spell if you dont get much

   sophie she was downstairs with some of the neighboursmy wife
   matildy she thats dead an gone this thirty year was one of them
   they were all tryin to find out whether thorndike was over when tom
   came home and whether findin him there was what set poor tom off i
   may as well say as some folks thought it mighty funny that sophie
   didnt carry on more nor mind the way thorndike had smiled not as
   anybody was hintin that henry helped tom off with some of his queer
   cookedup fluids and syringes or that sophie would keep still if she
   thought sobut you know how folks will guess behind a bodys back we
   all knowed the nigh crazy way thorndike had hated tomnot without
   reason at thatand emily barbour says to my matildy as how henry was
   lucky to have ol doc pratt right on the spot with a death certificate
   as didnt leave no doubt for nobody

   when old calvin gets to this point he usually begins to mumble
   indistinguishably in his straggling dirty white beard most listeners
   try to edge away from him and he seldom appears to heed the gesture
   it is generally fred peck who was a very small boy at the time of the
   events who continues the tale

   thomas spragues funeral was held on thursday june 17th only two days
   after his death such haste was thought almost indecent in remote and
   inaccessibly stillwater where long distances had to be covered by
   those who came but thorndike had insisted that the peculiar condition
   of the deceased demanded it the undertaker had seemed rather nervous
   since preparing the body and could be seen frequently feeling his
   pulse old dr pratt thought he must be worrying about the accidental
   dose of embalmingfluid naturally the story of the laying out had
   spread so that a double zest animated the mourners who assembled to
   glut their curiosity and morbid interest

   thorndike though he was obviously upset seemed intent on doing his
   professional duty in magnificent style sophie and others who saw the
   body were most startled by its utter lifelikeness and the mortuary
   virtuoso made doubly sure of his job by repeating certain injections at
   stated intervals he almost wrung a sort of reluctant admiration from
   the townsfolk and visitors though he tended to spoil that impression
   by his boastful and tasteless talk whenever he administered to his
   silent charge he would repeat that eternal rambling about the good luck
   of having a firstclass undertaker whathe would say as if directly
   addressing the bodyif tom had had one of those careless fellows who
   bury their subjects alive? the way he harped on the horrors of
   premature burial was truly barbarous and sickening

   services were held in the stuffy best roomopened for the first time
   since mrs sprague died the tuneless little parlour organ groaned
   disconsolately and the coffin supported on trestles near the hall
   door was covered with sicklysmelling flowers it was obvious that a
   recordbreaking crowd was assembling from far and near and sophie
   endeavoured to look properly griefstricken for their benefit at
   unguarded moments she seemed both puzzled and uneasy dividing her
   scrutiny between the feverishlooking undertaker and the lifelike body
   of her brother a slow disgust at thorndike seemed to be brewing within
   her and neighbours whispered freely that she would soon send him about
   his business now that tom was out of the waythat is if she could
   for such a slick customer was sometimes hard to deal with but with her
   money and remaining looks she might be able to get another fellow and
   hed probably take care of henry well enough

   as the organ wheezed into beautiful isle of somewhere the methodist
   church choir added their lugubrious voices to the gruesome cacophony
   and everyone looked piously at deacon leavitteveryone that is
   except crazy johnny dow who kept his eyes glued to the still form
   beneath the class of the coffin he was muttering softly to himself

   stephen barbourfrom the next farmwas the only one who noticed
   johnny he shivered as he saw that the idiot was talking directly to
   the corpse and even making foolish signs with his fingers as if to
   taunt the sleeper beneath the plate glass tom he reflected had
   kicked poor johnny around on more than one occasion though probably
   not without provocation something about this whole event was getting
   on stephens nerves there was a suppressed tension and brooding
   abnormality in the air for which he could not account johnny ought not
   to have been allowed in the houseand it was curious what an effort
   thorndike seemed to be making not to look at the body every now and
   then the undertaker would feel his pulse with an odd air

   the reverend silas atwood droned on in a plaintive monotone about the
   deceasedabout the striking of deaths sword in the midst of this
   little family breaking the earthly tie between this loving brother and
   sister several of the neighbours looked furtively at one another from
   beneath lowered eyelids while sophie actually began to sob nervously
   thorndike moved to her side and tried to reassure her but she seemed
   to shrink curiously away from him his motions were distinctly uneasy
   and he seemed to feel acutely the abnormal tension permeating the air
   finally conscious of his duty as master of ceremonies he stepped
   forward and announced in a sepulchral voice that the body might be
   viewed for the last time

   slowly the friends and neighbours filed past the bier from which
   thorndike roughly dragged crazy johnny away tom seemed to be resting
   peacefully that devil had been handsome in his day a few genuine
   sobsand many feigned oneswere heard though most of the crowd were
   content to stare curiously and whisper afterward steve barbour
   lingered long and attentively over the still face and moved away
   shaking his head his wife emily following after him whispered that
   henry thorndike had better not boast so much about his work for toms
   eyes had come open they had been shut when the services began for she
   had been up and looked but they certainly looked naturalnot the way
   one would expect after two days

   when fred peck gets this far he usually pauses as if he did not like to
   continue the listener too tends to feel that something unpleasant is
   ahead but peck reassures his audience with the statement that what
   happened isnt as bad as folks like to hint even steve never put into
   words what he may have thought and crazy johnny of course cant be
   counted at all

   it was luella morsethe nervous old maid who sang in the choirwho
   seems to have touched things off she was filing past the coffin like
   the rest but stopped to peer a little closer than anyone else except
   the barbours had peered and then without warning she gave a shrill
   scream and fell in a dead faint

   naturally the room was at once a chaos of confusion old dr pratt
   elbowed his way to luella and called for some water to throw in her
   face and others surged up to look at her and the coffin johnny dow
   began chanting to himself he knows he knows he kin hear all were
   asayin and see all were adoin and theyll bury him that waybut
   no one stopped to decipher his mumbling except steve barbour

   in a very few moments luella began to come out of her faint and could
   not tell exactly what had startled her all she could whisper was the
   way he lookedthe way he looked but to other eyes the body seemed
   exactly the same it was a gruesome sight though with those open eyes
   and that high colouring

   and then the bewildered crowed noticed something which put both luella
   and the body out of their minds for a moment it was thorndikeon whom
   the sudden excitement and jostling crowd seemed to be having a
   curiously bad effect he had evidently been knocked down in the general
   bustle and was on the floor trying to drag himself to a sitting
   posture the expression on his face was terrifying in the extreme and
   his eyes were beginning to take on a glazed fishy expression he could
   scarcely speak aloud but the husky rattle of his throat held an
   ineffable desperation which was obvious to all

   get me home quick and let me be that fluid i got in my arm by
   mistakeheart actionthe damned excitementtoo
   muchwaitwaitdont think im dead if i seem toonly the
   fluidjust get me home and waitill come to later dont know how
   longall the time ill be conscious and know whats going ondont
   be deceived

   as his words trailed off into nothingness old dr pratt reached him and
   felt his pulsewatching a long time and finally shaking his head no
   use doing anythinghes gone heart no goodand that fluid he got in
   his arm must have been bad stuff i dont know what it is

   a kind of numbness seemed to fall on all the company new death in the
   chamber of death! only steve barbour thought to bring up thorndikes
   last choking words was he surely dead when he himself had said he
   might falsely seem so? wouldnt it be better to wait a while and see
   what would happen? and for that matter what harm would it do if doc
   pratt were to give tom sprague another looking over before burial?

   crazy johnny was moaning and had flung himself on thorndikes body
   like a faithful dog dont ye bury him dont ye bury him! he aint
   dead no more nor lige hopkinss dog nor deacon leavitts calf was when
   he shot em full hes got some stuff he puts into ye to make ye seem
   like dead when ye aint! ye seem like dead but ye know everything
   whats agoin on and the next day ye come to as good as ever dont
   ye bury himhell come to under the earth an he cant scratch up!
   hes a good man an not like tom sprague hope to gawd tom scratches
   an chokes for hours an hours

   but no one save barbour was paying any attention to poor johnny
   indeed what steve himself had said had evidently fallen on deaf ears
   uncertainly was everywhere old doc pratt was applying final tests and
   mumbling about death certificate blanks and unctuous elder atwood was
   suggesting that something be done about a double interment with
   thorndike dead there was no undertaker this side of rutland and it
   would mean a terrible expense if one were to be brought from there and
   if thorndike were not embalmed in this hot june weatherwell one
   couldnt tell and there were no relatives or friends to be critical
   unless sophie chose to bebut sophie was on the other side of the
   room staring silently fixedly and almost morbidly into her brothers
   coffin

   deacon leavitt tried to restore a semblance of decorum and had poor
   thorndike carried across the hall to the sittingroom meanwhile
   sending zenas wells and walter perkins over to the undertakers house
   for a coffin of the right size the key was in henrys trousers pocket
   johnny continued to whine and paw at the body and elder atwood busied
   himself with inquiring about thorndikes denominationfor henry had
   not attended local services when it was decided that his folks in
   rutlandall dead nowhad been baptists the reverend silas decided
   that deacon leavitt had better offer the brief prayer

   it was a gala day for the funeralfanciers of stillwater and vicinity
   even luella had recovered enough to stay gossip murmured and
   whispered buzzed busily while a few composing touches were given to
   thorndikes cooling stiffening form johnny had been cuffed out of the
   house as most agreed he should have been in the first place but his
   distant howls were now and then wafted gruesomely in

   when the body was encoffined and laid out beside that of thomas
   sprague the silent almost frighteninglooking sophie gazed intently
   as it as she had gazed at her brothers she had not uttered a word for
   a dangerously long time and the mixed expression on her face was past
   all describing or interpreting as the others withdrew to leave her
   alone with the dead she managed to find a sort of mechanical speech
   but no one could make out the words and she seemed to be talking first
   to one body and then the other

   and now with what would seem to an outside the acme of gruesome
   unconscious comedy the whole funeral mummery of the afternoon was
   listlessly repeated again the organ wheezed again the choir screeched
   and scraped again a droning incantation arose and again the morbidly
   curious spectators filed past a macabre objectthis time a dual array
   of mortuary repose some of the more sensitive people shivered at the
   whole proceeding and again stephen barbour felt an underlying note of
   eldritch horror and daemoniac abnormality god how lifelike both of
   those corpses wereand how in earnest poor thorndike had been about
   not wanting to be judged deadand how he hated tom spraguebut what
   could one do in the face of common sensea dead man was a dead man
   and there was old doc pratt with his years of experienceif nobody
   else bothered why should one bother oneself?whatever tom had got he
   had probably deservedand if henry had done anything to him the
   score was even nowwell sophie was free at last

   as the peering procession moved at last toward the hall and the outer
   door sophie was alone with the dead once more elder atwood was out in
   the road talking to the hearsedriver from lees livery stable and
   deacon leavitt was arranging for a double quota of pallbearers
   luckily the hearse would hold two coffins no hurryed plummer and
   ethan stone were going ahead with shovels to dig the second grave
   there would be three livery hacks and any number of private rigs in the
   cavalcadeno use trying to keep the crowd away from the graves

   then came that frantic scream from the parlour where sophie and the
   bodies were its suddenness almost paralysed the crowd and brought back
   the same sensation which had surged up when luella had screamed and
   fainted steve barbour and deacon leavitt started to go in but before
   they could enter the house sophie was bursting forth sobbing and
   gasping about that face at the window!that face at the window!

   at the same time a wildeyed figure rounded the corner of the house
   removing all mystery from sophies dramatic cry it was very
   obviously the faces ownerpoor crazy johnny who began to leap up
   and down pointing at sophie and shrieking she knows! she knows! i
   seen it in her face when she looked at em and talked to em! she
   knows and shes alettin em go down in the earth to scratch and claw
   for airbut theyll talk to her sos she kin hear emtheyll talk
   to her an appear to herand some day theyll come back an git
   her!

   zenas wells dragged the shrieking halfwit to a woodshed behind the
   house and bolted him in as best he could his screams and poundings
   could be heard at a distance but nobody paid him any further
   attention the procession was made up and with sophie in the first
   hack it slowly covered the short distance past the village to the swamp
   hollow buryingground

   elder atwood made appropriate remarks as thomas sprague was laid to
   rest and by the time he was through ed and ethan had finished
   thorndikes grave on the other side of the cemeteryto which the crowd
   was presently shifted deacon leavitt then spoke ornamentally and the
   lowering process was repeated people had begun to drift off in knots
   and the clatter of receding buggies and carryalls was quite universal
   when the shovels began to fly again as the earth thudded down on the
   coffinlids thorndikes first steve barbour noticed the queer
   expressions flitting over sophie spragues face he couldnt keep track
   of them all but behind the rest there seemed to lurk a sort of wry
   perverse halfsuppressed look of vague triumph he shook his head

   zenas had run ahead and let crazy johnny out of the woodshed before
   sophie got home and the poor fellow at once made frantically for the
   graveyard he arrived before the shovelmen were through and while many
   of the curious mourners were still lingering about what he shouted
   into tom spragues partly filled grave and how he clawed at the loose
   earth of thorndikes freshly finished mound across the cemetery
   surviving spectators still shudder to recall jotham blake the
   constable had to take him back to the town farm by force and his
   screams waked dreadful echoes

   this is where fred peck usually leaves off the story what more he
   asks is there to tell? it was a gloomy tragedy and one can scarcely
   wonder that sophie grew queer after that that is all one hears if the
   hour is so late that old calvin wheeler has tottered home but when he
   is still around he breaks in again with that damnably suggestive and
   insidious whisper sometimes those who hear him dread to pass either
   the shuttered house or the graveyard afterward especially after dark

   heh hehfred was only a little shaver then and dont remember no
   more than half of what was goin on! you want to know why sophie keeps
   her house shuttered and why crazy johnny still keeps atalkin to the
   dead and ashoutin at sophies windows? well sir i dont knows i
   know all there is to know but i hear what i hear

   here the old man ejects his cud of tobacco and leans forward to
   buttonhole the listener

   it was that same night mind yetoward mornin and just eight hours
   after them burialswhen we heard the first scream from sophies house
   woke us all upsteve and emily barbour and me and matildy goes over
   hotfootin all in night gear and finds sophie all dressed and dead
   fainted on the settinroom floor lucky she hadnt locked the door
   when we got her to she was shakin like a leaf and wouldnt let on by
   so much as a word what was ailin her matildy and emily done what they
   could to quiet her down but steve whispered things to me as didnt
   make me none too easy come about an hour when we allowed wed be goin
   home soon that sophie she begun to tip her head on one side like she
   was alistenin to somethin then on a sudden she screamed again and
   keeled over in another faint

   well sir im tellin what im tellin and wont do no guessin like
   steve barbour would a done if he dared he always was the greatest hand
   for hintin thingsdied ten years ago of pneumony

   

   what we heard so faintlike was just poor crazy johnny of course
   taint more than a mile to the buryinground and he must a got out of
   the window where theyd locked him up at the town farmeven if
   constable blake says he didnt get out that night from that day to
   this he hangs around them graves atalkin to the both of themcussin
   and kickin at toms mound and puttin posies and things on henrys
   and when he aint adoin that hes hangin around sophies shuttered
   windows howlin about whats acomin soon to git her

   she wouldnt never go near the buryinground and now she wont come
   out of the house at all nor see nobody got to sayin there was a curse
   on stillwaterand im dinged if she aint half right the way things
   is agoin to pieces these days there certainly was somethin queer
   about sophie right along once when sally hopkins was acallin on

   crazy johnny over to the buryinground let jotham blake claim what he
   will there aint no tellin the sound of a mans voice so far off and
   with our heads full of nonsense it aint no wonder we thought there was
   two voicesand voices that hadnt ought to be speakin at all

   steve he claimed to have heard more than i did i verily believe he
   took some stock in ghosts matildy and emily was so scared they didnt
   remember what they heard and curious enough nobody else in townif
   anybody was awake at the ungodly hournever said nothin about hearin
   no sounds at all

   whatever it was was so faint it might have been the wind if there
   hadnt been words i made out a few but dont want to say as id back

1[edit]

   it was languid curiosity which first brought stephen jones to rogers
   museum someone had told him about the queer underground place in
   southwark street across the river where waxen things so much more
   horrible than the worst effigies at madame tussauds were shown and he
   had strolled in one april day to see how disappointing he would find
   it oddly he was not disappointed there was something different and
   distinctive here after all of course the usual gory commonplaces
   were presentlandru doctor crippen madame demers rizzio lady jane
   grey endless maimed victims of war and revolution and monsters like
   gilles de rais and marquis de sadebut there were other things which
   had made him breathe faster and stay till the ringing of the closing
   bell the man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary
   mountebank there was imaginationeven a kind of diseased geniusin
   some of this stuff

   later he had learned about george rogers the man had been on the
   tussaud staff but some trouble had developed which led to his
   discharge there were aspersions on his sanity and tales of his crazy
   forms of secret worshipthough latterly his success with his own
   basement museum had dulled the edge of some criticisms while sharpening
   the insidious point of others teratology and the iconography of
   nightmare were his hobbies and even he had had the prudence to screen
   off some of his worst effigies in a special alcove for adults only it
   was this alcolve which had fascinated jones so much there were lumpish
   hybrid things which only fantasy could spawn molded with devilish
   skill and colored in a horribly lifelike fashion

   some were the figures of wellknown mythgorgons chimeras dragons
   cyclops and all their shuddersome congeners others were drawn from
   darker and more furtively whispered cycles of subterranean
   legendblack formless tsathoggua manytentacled cthulhu
   proboscidian chaugnar faugn and other rumored blasphemies from
   forbidden books like the necronomicon the book of eibon or the
   unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt but the worst were wholly
   original with rogers and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity
   had ever dared to suggest several were hideous parodies on forms of
   organic life we know while others seemed to be taken from feverish
   dreams of other planets and galaxies the wilder painted of clark
   ashton smith might suggest a fewbut nothing could suggest the effect
   of poignant loathsome terror created by their great size and
   fiendishly cunning workmanship and by the diabolically clever lighting
   conditions under which they were exhibited

   stephen jones as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art had
   sought out rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the
   vaulted museum chamberan evillooking crypt lighted dimly by dusty
   windows set slitlike and horizontal in the brick wall on a level with
   the ancient cobblestones of a hidden courtyard it was here that the
   images were repairedhere too where some of them had been made
   waxen arms legs heads and torsos lay in grotesque array on various
   benches while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs ravenouslooking
   teeth and glassy staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered
   costumes of all sorts hung from hooks and in one alcove were great
   piles of fleshcolored waxcakes and shelves filled with paintcans and
   brushes of every description in the center of the room was a large
   meltingfurnace used to prepare the wax for molding its firebox
   topped by a huge iron container on hinges with a spout which permitted
   the pouring of melted wax with the merest touch of a finger

   other things in the dismal crypt were less describableisolated parts
   of problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of
   delirium at one end was a door of heavy plank fastened by an
   unusually large padlock and with a very peculiar symbol painted over
   it jone who had once had access to the dreaded necronomicon shivered
   involuntarily as he recognized that symbol this showman he reflected
   must indeed be a person of disconcertingly wide scholarship in dark and
   dubious fields

   nor did the conversation of rogers disappoint him the man was tall
   lean and rather unkempt with large black eyes which gazed
   combustively from a pallid and usually stubblecovered face he did not
   resent jones intrusion but seemed to welcome the chance of
   unburdening himself to an interested person his voice was of singular
   depth and resonance and harbored a sort of repressed intensity
   bordering on the feverish jones did not wonder that many had thought
   him mad

   with every successive calland such calls became a habit as the weeks
   went byjones had found rogers more communicative and confidential
   from the first there had been hints of strange faiths and practices on
   the showmans part and later on those hints expanded into
   talesdespite a few odd corroborative photographswhose extravagence
   was almost comic it was some time in june on a night when jones had
   brought a bottle of good whisky and plied his host somewhat freely
   that the really demented talk first appeared before that there had
   been wild enough storiesaccounts of mysterious trips to tibet the
   african interior the arabian desert the amazon valley alaska and
   certain littleknown islands of the south pacific plus claims of
   having read such monstrous and halffabulous books as the prehistoric
   pnakotic fragments and the dhol chants attributed to malign and
   nonhuman lengbut nothing in all this had been so unmistakably insane
   as what had cropped out that june evening under the spell of the
   whisky

   to be plain rogers began making vague boasts of having found certain
   things in nature that no one had found before and of having brought
   back tangible evidences of such discoveries according to his bibulous
   harangue he had gone farther than anyone else in interpreting the
   obscure and primal books he studied and had been directed by them to
   certain remote places where strange survivals are hiddensurvivals of
   æons and lifecycles earlier than mankind and in some case connected
   with other dimensions and other worlds communication with which was
   frequent in the forgotten prehuman days jones marveled at the fancy
   which could conjure up such notions and wondered just what rogers
   mental history had been had his work amidst the morbid grotesequeries
   of madame tussauds been the start of his imaginative flights or was
   the tendency innate so that his choice of occupation was merely one of
   its manifestations? at any rate the mans work was merely[?] very
   closely linked with his notions even now there was no mistaking the
   trend of his blackest hints about the nightmare monstrosities in the
   screenedoff adults only alcove heedless of ridicule he was trying
   to imply that not all of these demoniac abnormalities were artificial

   it was jones frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible
   claims which broke up the growing cordiality rogers it was clear
   took himself very seriously; for he now became morose and resentful
   continuing to tolerate jones only through a dogged urge to break down
   his wall of urbane and complacent incredulity wild tales and
   suggestions of rites and sacrifices to nameless elder gods continued
   and now and then rogers would lead his guest to one of the hideous
   blasphemies in the screenoff alcolve and point out features difficult
   to reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship jones continued
   his visits through sheer fascination though he knew he had forfeited
   his hosts regards at times he would humor rogers with pretended
   assent to some mad hint or assertion but the gaunt showman was seldom
   to be deceived by such tactics

   the tension came to a head later in september jones had casually
   dropped into the museum one afternoon and was wandering through the
   dim corridors whose horror were now so familiar when he heard a very
   peculiar sound from the general direction of rogers workroom others
   heard it too and started nervously as the echoes reverberated through
   the great vaulted basement the three attendants exchanged odd glances;
   and one of them a dark taciturn foreignlooking fellow who always
   served rogers as a repairer and assistant designer smiled in a way
   which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which grated very harshly on
   some facet of jones sensibilities it was the yelp or scream of a dog
   and was such a sound as could be made only under conditions of the
   utmost fright and agony combined its stark anguised frenzy was
   appalling to hear and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held
   a double hideousness jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the
   museum

   he was about to go to the door leading into the workroom when the dark
   attendant stopped him with a word and a gesture mr rogers the man
   said in a soft somewhat accented voice at once apologetic and vaguely
   sardonic was out and there were standing orders to admit no one to
   the workroom during his absence as for that yelp it was undoubtedly
   something out in the courtyard behind the museum this neighborhood was
   full of stray mongrels and their fights were sometimes shockingly
   noisy there were no dogs in any part of the museum but if mr jones
   wished to see mr rogers he might find him just before closingtime

   after this jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and
   examined the squalid neighborhood curiously the leaning decrepit
   buildingsonce dwellings but now largely shops and warehouseswere
   very ancient indeed some of them were of a gabled type seeming to go
   back to tudor times and a faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the
   whole region beside the dingy house whose basement held the museum was
   a low archway pierced by a dark cobbled alley and this jones entered
   in a vague wish to find the courtyard behind the workroom and settle
   the affair of the dog comfortably in his mind the courtyard was dim in
   the late afternoon light hemmed in by rear walls even uglier and more
   intangibly menacing than the crumbling facades of the evil old houses
   not a dog was in sight and jones wondered how the aftermath of such a
   frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soon

   despite the assistants statement that no dog had been in the museum
   jones glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement
   workroomnarrow horizontal rectangles close to the grassgrown
   pavement with grimy panes that stared repulsively and incuriously like
   the eyes of dead fish to their left a worn flight of stairs led to an
   opaque and heavily bolted door some impulse urged him to crouch low on
   the damp broken cobblestones and peer in on the chance that the thick
   green shades worked by long cords that hung down to a reachable level
   might not be drawn the outer surfaces were thick with dirt but as he
   rubbed them with his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring curtain
   in the way of his vision

   so shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made
   out but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up
   spectrally as jones tried each of the windows in turn it seemed
   evident at first that no one was within; yet when he peered through the
   extreme righthand windowthe one nearest the entrance alleyhe saw a
   glow of light at the farther end of the apartment which made him pause
   in bewilderment there was no reason why any light should be there it
   was an inner side of the room and he could not recall any gas or
   electric fixture near that point another look defined the glow as a
   large vertical rectangle and a though occurred to him it was in that
   direction that he had always noticed the heavy plank door with the
   abnormally large padlockthe door which was never opened and above
   which was crudely smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the
   fragmentary records of forbidden elder magic it must be open nowand
   there was a light inside all his former speculation as to where that
   door led and as to what lay behind it were now renewed with trebly
   disquieting force

   jones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six
   oclock when he returned to the museum to make the call on rogers he
   could hardly tell why he wished so especially to see the man just then
   but there must have been some subconscious misgivings about that
   terribly unplaceable canine scream of the afternoon and about the glow
   of light in that disturbing and usually unopened inner doorway with the
   heavy padlock the attendants were leaving as he arrived and he
   thought that orabonathe dark foreignlooking assistanteyed him with
   something like sly repressed amusement he did not relish that
   lookeven though he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer many
   times

   the vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion but he
   strode quickly through it and rapped at the door of the office and
   workroom response was slow in coming though there were footsteps
   inside finally in response to a second knock the lock rattled and
   the ancient sixpanelled portal creaked reluctantly open to reveal the
   slouching feverisheyed form of george rogers from the first it was
   clear that the showman was in an unusual mood there was a curious
   mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome and his talk
   at once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible
   sort

   surviving elder godsnameless sacrificesthe other than artificial
   nature of some of the alcove horrorsall the usual boasts but uttered
   in a tone of peculiarly increasing confidence obviously jones
   reflected the poor fellows madness was gaining on him from time to
   time rogers would send furtive glances toward the heavy padlocked
   inner door at the end of the room or toward a piece of coarse burlap
   on the floor not far from it beneath which some small object appeared
   to be lying jones grew more nervous as the moments passed and began
   to feel as hesitant about mentioning the afternoons oddities as he had
   formerly been anxious to do so

   rogers sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement
   of his fevered rambling

   do you remember he shouted what i told you about that ruined city
   in indochina where the tchotchos lived? you had to admit id been
   there when you saw the photographs even if you did think i made that
   oblong swimmer in darkness out of wax if youd seen it writhing in the
   underground pools as i did   

   well this is bigger still i never told you about this because i
   wanted to work out the later parts before making any claim when you
   see the snapshots youll know the geography couldnt have been faked
   and i fancy i have another way of proving it isnt any waxed concoction
   of mine youve never seen it for the experiments wouldnt let me keep
   it on exhibition

   the showman glanced queerly at the padlocked door

   it all comes from that long ritual in the eighth pnakotic fragment
   when i got it figured out i saw it could only have one meaning there
   were things in the north before the land of lomarbefore mankind
   existedand this was one of them it took us all the way to alaska
   and up the nootak from fort morton but the thing was there as we knew
   it would be great cyclopean ruins acres of them there was less left
   than we had hoped for but after three million years what could one
   expect? and werent the eskimo legends all in the right direction? we
   couldnt get one of the beggars to go with us and had to sledge all
   the way back to nome for americans orabona was no good up in that
   climateit made him sullen and hateful

   ill tell you later how we found it when we got the ice blasted out
   of the pylons of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it
   would be some carvings still there and it was no trouble keeping the
   yankees from following us in orabona shivered like a leafyoud never
   think it from the damned insolent way he struts around here he knew
   enough of the elder lore to be properly afraid the eternal light was
   gone but our torches showed enough we saw the bones of others who had
   been before usæons ago when the climate was warm some of those bones
   were of things you couldnt even imagine at the third level down we
   found the ivory throne the fragments said so much aboutand i may as
   well tell you it wasnt empty

   the thing on the throne didnt moveand we knew then that it needed
   the nourishment of sacrifice but we didnt want to wake it then
   better to get it to london first orabona and i went to the surface for
   the big box but when we had packed it we couldnt get it up the three
   flights of steps these steps werent made for human beings and their
   size bothered us anyway it was devilish heavy we had to have the
   americans down to get it out they werent anxious to go into the
   place but of course the worst thing was safely inside the box we told
   them it was a batch of ivory carvingarcheological stuff; and after
   seeing the carved throne they probably believed us its a wonder they
   didnt suspect hidden treasure and demand a share they must have told
   queer tales around nome later on; though i doubt if they ever went back
   to those ruins even for the ivory throne

   rogers paused felt around in his desk and produced an envelope of
   goodsized photographic prints extracting one and laying it face down
   before him he handed the rest to jones the set was certainly an odd
   one: iceclad hills dog sledges men in furs and vast tumbled ruins
   against a background of snowruins whose bizarre outlines and enormous
   stone blocks could hardly be accounted for one flashlight view showed
   an incredible interior chamber with wild carvings and a curious throne
   whose proportions could not have been designed for a human occupant
   the carvings of the gigantic masonryhigh walls and peculiar vaulting
   overheadwere mainly symbolic and involved both wholly unknown
   designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited in obscene legends over
   the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on the
   workroom wall above the padlocked plank door jones darted a nervous
   glance at the closed portal assuredly rogers had been to strange
   places and had seen strange things yet this mad interior picture might
   easily be a fraudtaken from a very clever stage setting one must not
   be too credulous but rogers was continuing:

   well we shipped the box from nome and got to london without any
   trouble that was the first time wed ever brought back anything that
   had a chance of coming alive i didnt put it on display because there
   were more important things to do for it it needed the nourishment of
   sacrifice for it was a god of course i couldnt get it the sort of
   sacrifices which it used to have in its day for such things dont
   exist now but there were other things which might do the blood is the
   life you know even the lemures and elementals that are older than the
   earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the
   right conditions

   the expression on the narrators face was growing very alarming and
   repulsive so that jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair rogers
   seemed to notice his guests nervousness and continued with a
   distinctly evil smile

   it was last year that i got it and ever since then ive been trying
   rites and sacrifices orabona hasnt been much help for he was always
   against the idea of waking it he hates itprobably because hes
   afraid of what it will come to mean he carries a pistol all the time
   to protect himselffool as if there were human protection against it!
   if i ever see him draw that pistol ill strangle him he wanted me to
   kill it and make an effigy of it but ive stuck by my plans and im
   coming out on top in spite of all the cowards like orabona and damned
   sniggering skeptics like you jones! ive chanted the rites and made
   certain sacrifices and last week the transition came the sacrifice
   wasreceived and enjoyed!

   rogers actually licked his lips while jones held himsef uneasily
   rigid the showman paused and rose crossing the room to the piece of
   burlap at which he had glanced so often bending down he took hold of
   one corner as he spoke again

   youve laughed enough at my worknow its time for you to get some
   facts orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this
   afternoon do you know what that meant?

   jones started for all his curiosity he would have been glad to get out
   without further light on the point which had so puzzled him but rogers
   was inexorable and began to lift the square of burlap beneath it lay
   a crushed almost shapeless mass which jones was slow to classify was
   it a onceliving thing which some agency had flattened sucked dry of
   blood punctured in a thousand places and wrung into a limp
   brokenboned heap of grotesqueness? after a moment jones realized what
   it must be it was what was left of a doga dog perhaps of
   considerable size and whitish color its breed was past recognition
   for distortion had come in nameless and hideous ways most of the hair
   was burned off as by some pungent acid and the exposed bloodless skin
   was riddled by innumerable circular wounds or incisions the form of
   torture necessary to cause such results was past imagining

   electrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust
   jones sprang with a cry

   you damned sadistyou madmanyou do a thing like this and dare to
   speak to a decent man!

   rogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming
   guest his words held an unnatural calm

   why you fool do you think i did this? what of it? it is not human
   and does not pretend to be to sacrifice is merely to offer i gave the
   dog to it what happened is its work not mine it needed the
   nourishment of the offering and took it in its own way but let me
   show you what it looks like

   as jones stood hesitating the speaker had returned to his desk and
   took up the photograph he had laid face down without showing now he
   extended it with a curious look jones took it and glanced at in in an
   almost mechanical way after a moment the visitors glance became
   sharper and more absorbed for the utterly satanic force of the object
   depicted had an almost hypnotic effect certainly rogers had outdone
   himself in modeling the eldritch nightmare which the camera had caught
   the thing was a work of sheer infernal genius and jones wondered how
   the public would react when it was placed on exhibition so hideous a
   thing had no right to existprobably the mere contemplation of it
   after it was done had completed the unhinging of its makers mind and
   led him to worship it with brutal sacrifices only a stout sanity could
   resist the insidious suggestion that the blasphemy wasor had once
   beensome morbid and exotic form of actual life

   the thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to
   be a clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other
   curious photograph to describe it with any ordinary vocabulary would
   be impossible for nothing even roughly corresponding to it has ever
   come within the imagination of sane mankind it represented something
   meant perhaps to be roughly connected with the vertebrates of this
   planetthough one could not be too sure of that its bulk was
   cyclopean for even squatted it towered to almost twice the height of
   orabona who was shown beside it looking sharply one might trace its
   approximations toward the bodily features of the higher vertebrates

   there was an almost globular torso with six long sinuous limbs
   terminating in crablike claws from the upper end a subsidiary globe
   bulged forth bubblelike; its triangle of three staring fishy eyes
   its footlong and evidently flexible proboscis and a distended lateral
   system analogous to gills suggesting that it was a head most of the
   body was covered with what at first appeared to be fur but which on
   closer examination proved to be a dense growth of dark slender
   tentacles or sucking filaments each tipped with a mouth suggesting the
   head of an asp on the head and below the proboscis the tentacles
   tended to be longer and thicker marked with spiral stripessuggesting
   the traditional serpentlocks of medusa to suggest that such a thing
   could have an expression seems paradoxical; yet jones felt that that
   triangle of bulging fish eyes and that obliquely poised proboscis all
   bespoke a blend of hate greed and sheer cruelty incomprehensible to
   mankind because it was mixed with other emotions not of the world or
   this solar system into this bestial abnormality he reflected rogers
   must have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny
   sculptural genius the thing was incredibleand yet the photograph
   proved that it existed

   rogers interrupted his reveries

   wellwhat do you think of it? now do you wonder what crushed the dog
   and sucked it dry with a million mouths? it needed nourishmentand it
   will need more it is a god and i am the first priest of its
   latterday hierarchy iä! shubniggurath! the goat with a thousand
   young!

   jones lowered the photograph in disgust and pity

   see here rogers this wont do there are limits you know its a
   great piece of work and all that but it isnt good for you better
   not see it any morelet orabona break it up and try to forget about
   it and let me tear this beastly picture up too

   with a snarl rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the
   desk

   idiotyouand you still think its a fraud! you still think i made
   it and you still think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax! why
   damn you youre going to know not just now for it is resting after
   the sacrificebut later oh yesyou will not doubt the power of it
   then

   as rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door jones retrieved his
   hat and stick from a nearby bench

   very well rogers let it be later i must be going now but ill call
   round tomorrow afternoon think my advice over and see if it doesnt
   sound sensible ask orabona what he thinks too

   rogers bared his teeth in wildbeast fashion

   must be going now eh? afraid after all! afraid for all your bold
   talk! you say the effigies are only wax and yet you run away when i
   begin to prove that they arent youre like the fellows who take my
   standing bet that they darent spend the night in the museumthey come
   boldly enough but after an hour they shriek and hammer to get out!
   want me to ask orabona eh? you twoalways against me! you want to
   break down the coming earthly reign of it!

   jones preserved his calm

   no rogerstheres nobody against you and im not afraid of your
   figures either much as i admire your skill but were both a bit
   nervous tonight and i fancy some rest will do us good

   again rogers checked his guests departure

   not afraid eh?then why are you so anxious to go? look heredo you
   or dont you dare to stay alone here in the dark? whats your hurry if
   you dont believe in it?

   some new idea seemed to have struck rogers and jones eyed him closely

   why ive no special hurrybut what would be gained by my staying
   here alone? what would it prove? my only objection is that it isnt
   very comfortable for sleeping what good would it do either of us?

   this time it was jones who was struck with an idea he continued in a
   tone of conciliation

   see here rogersive just asked you what it would prove if i stayed
   when we both knew it would prove that your effigies are just effigies
   and that you oughtnt to let your imagination go the way its been
   going lately suppose i do stay if i stick it out till morning will
   you agree to take a new view of thingsgo on a vacation for three
   months or so and let orabona destroy that new thing of yours? come
   nowisnt that fair?

   the expression on the showmans face was hard to read it was obvious
   that he was thinking quickly and that of sundry conflicting emotions
   malign triumph was getting the upper hand his voice held a choking
   quality as he replied

   fair enough! if you do stick it out ill take your advice well go
   out for dinner and come back ill lock you in the display room and go
   home in the morning ill come down ahead of orabonahe comes half an
   hour before the restand see how you are but dont try it unless you
   are very sure of your skepticism others have backed outyou have that
   chance and i suppose a pounding on the outer door would always bring a
   constable you may not like it so well after a whileyoull be in the
   same building though not in the same room with it

   as they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard rogers took with
   him the piece of burlapweighted with a gruesome burden near the
   center of the court was a manhole whose cover the showman lifted
   quietly and with a shuddersome suggestion of familiarity burlap and
   all the burden went down to the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth jones
   shuddered and almost shrank from the gaunt figure at his side as they
   emerged into the street

   by unspoken mutual consent they did not dine together but agreed to
   meet in front of the museum at eleven

   jones hailed a cab and breathed more freely when he had crossed
   waterloo bridge and was approaching the brilliantly lighted strand he
   dined at a quite café and subsequently went to his home in portland
   place to bathe and get a few things idly he wondered what rogers was
   doing he had heard that the man had a vast dismal house in the
   walworth road full of obscure and forbidden books occult
   paraphernalia and wax images which he did not choose to place on
   exhibition orabona he understood lived in separate quarters in the
   same house

   at eleven jones found rogers waiting by the basement door in southwark
   street their words were few but each seemed taut with a menacing
   tension they agreed that the vaulted exhibition room alone should form
   the scene of the vigil and rogers did not insist that the watcher sit
   in the special adult alcove of supreme horrors the showman having
   extinguished all the lights with switches in the workroom locked the
   door of that crypt with one of the keys on his crowded ring without
   shaking hands he passed out the street door locked it after him and
   passed up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside as his tread receded
   jones realized that the long tedious vigil had commenced

2[edit]

   later in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar jones cursed
   the childish naïveté which had brought him there for the first
   halfhour he had kept flashing his pocketlight at intervals but now
   just sitting in the dark on one of the visitors benches had become a
   more nervewracking thing every time the beam shot out it lighted up
   some morbid grotesque objecta guillotine a nameless hybrid monster
   a pastybearded face crafty with evil a body with red torrents
   streaming from a severed throat jones knew that no sinister reality
   was attached to these things but after that first halfhour he
   preferred not to see them

   why he had bothered to humor that madman he could scarcely imagine it
   would have been much simpler merely to have let him alone or to have
   called in a mental specialist probably he reflected it was the
   fellowfeeling of one artist for another there was so much genius in
   rogers that he deserved every possible chance to be helped quietly out
   of his growing mania any man who could imagine and construct the
   incredibly lifelike things that he had produced was not far from
   actual greatness he had the fancy of a sime or a doré joined to the
   minute scientific craftsmanship of a blatschka indeed he had done
   for the world of nightmare what the blatschkas with their marvelously
   accurate plant models of finely wrought and coloured glass had done for
   the world of botany

   at midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the
   darkness and jones felt cheered by the message from a stillsurviving
   outside world the vaulted museum chamber was like a tombghastly in
   its utter solitude even a mouse would be cheering company; yet rogers
   had once boasted thatfor certain reasons as he saidno mice or
   even insects ever came near the place that was very curious yet it
   seemed to be true the deadness and silence were virtually complete if
   only something would make a sound! he shuffled his feet and the echoes
   came spectrally out of the absolute stillness he coughed but there
   was something mocking in the staccato reverberations he could not he
   vowed begin talking to himself that meant nervous disintegration
   time seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting slowness he could
   have sworn that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on
   his watch yet here was only the stroke of midnight

   he wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen something
   in the darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them so that
   they responded to faint intimations hardly strong enough to be called
   true impressions his ears seemed at times to catch a faint elusive
   susurrus which could not quite be identified with the nocturnal hum of
   the squalid streets outside and he thought of vague irrelevant things
   like the music of the spheres and the unknown inaccessible life of
   alien dimensions pressing on our own rogers often speculated about
   such things

   the floating specks of light in his blacknessdrowned eyes seemed
   inclined to take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion he had
   often wondered about those strange rays from the unplumbed abyss which
   scintillate before us in the absence of all earthly illumination but
   he had never known any that behaved just as these were behaving they
   lacked the restful aimlessness of ordinary lightspeckssuggesting
   some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial conception

   then there was that suggestion of odd stirrings nothing was open yet
   in spite of the general draftlessness jones felt that the air was not
   uniformly quiet there were intangible variations in pressurenot
   quite decided enough to suggest the loathsome pawings of unseen
   elementals it was abnormally chilly too he did not like any of this
   the air tasted salty as if it were mixed with the brine of dark
   subterrene waters and there was a bare hint of some odor of ineffable
   mustiness in the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures
   had an odor even now that halfreceived hint was not the way wax
   figures ought to smell it was more like the faint smell of specimens
   in a naturalhistory museum curious in view of rogers claims that
   his figures were not all artificialindeed it was probably that claim
   which made ones imagination conjure up the olfactory suspicion one
   must guard against excesses of imaginationhad not such things driven
   poor rogers mad?

   but the utter loneliness of this place was frightful even the distant
   chimes seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs it made jones think of
   that insane picture which rogers had showed himthe wildly carved
   chamber with the cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed was part
   of a threemillionyearold ruin in the shunned and inaccessible
   solitudes of the arctic perhaps rogers had been to alaska but that
   picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery it couldnt normally
   be otherwise with all that carving and those terrible symbols and
   that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that thronewhat a
   flight of diseased fancy! jones wondered just how far he actually was
   from the insane masterpiece in waxprobably it was kept behind that
   heavy padlocked plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom but
   it would never do to brood about a waxen image was not the present
   room full of such things some of them scarcely less horrible than the
   dreadful it? and beyond a thin canvas screen on the left was the
   adults only alcove with its nameless phantoms of delirium

   the proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on jones
   nerves more and more as the quarterhours wore on he knew the museum
   so well that he could not get rid of their usual images even in the
   total darkness indeed the darkness had the effect of adding to the
   remembered images certain very disturbing imaginative overtones the
   guillotine seemed to creak and the bearded face of landruslayer of
   his fifty wivestwisted itself into expressions of monstrous menace
   from the severed throat of madame demers a hideous bubbling sound
   seemed to emanate while the headless legless victim of a trunk murder
   tried to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps jones began
   shutting his eyes to see if that would dim the images but found it was
   useless besides when he shut his eyes the strange purposeful
   patterns of lightspecks became more disturbingly pronounced

   then suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had
   formerly been trying to banish he tried to keep them because they were
   giving place to still more hideous ones in spite of himself his memory
   began reconstructing the utterly nonhuman blasphemies that lurked in
   the obscurer corners and these lumpish hybrid growths oozed and
   wriggled toward him as though huting him down in a circle black
   tsathoggua molded itself from a toadlike gargoyle to a long sinuous
   line with hundreds of rudimentary feet and a lean rubbery nightgaunt
   spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher jones braced
   himself to keep from screaming he knew he was reverting to the
   traditional terrors of his childhood and resolved to use his adult
   reason to keep the phantoms at bay it helped a bit he found to flash
   the light again frightful as were the images it showed these were not
   as bad as what his fancy called out of the utter blackness

   but there were drawbacks even in the light of his torch he could not
   help suspecting a slight furtive trembling on the part of the canvas
   partition screening off the terrible adults only alcove he knew what
   lay beyond and shivered imagination called up the shocking forms of
   fabulous yogsothothonly a congeries of iridescent globes yet
   stupendous in its malign suggestiveness what was this accursed mass
   slowly floating toward him and bumping on the partition that stood in
   the way? a small bulge in the canvas far to the right suggested the
   sharp horn of gnophkeh the hairy myththing of the greenland ice
   that walked sometimes on two legs sometimes on four and sometimes on
   six to get this stuff out of his head jones walked boldly toward the
   hellish alcove with torch burning steadily of course none of his
   fears was true yet were not the long facial tentalces of great
   cthulhu actually swaying slowly and insidiously? he knew they were
   flexible but he had not realised that the draft caused by his advance
   was enough to set them in motion

   returning to his former seat outside the alcove he shut his eyes and
   let the symmetrical lightspecks do their worst the distant clock
   boomed a single stroke could it be only one? he flashed the light on
   his watch and saw that it was precisely that hour it would be hard
   indeed waiting for the morning rogers would be down at about eight
   oclock ahead of even orabona it would be light outside in the main
   basement long before that but none of it could penetrate here all the
   windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three small ones
   facing the court a pretty bad wait all told

   his ears were getting most of the hallucinations nowfor he could
   swear he heard stealthy plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the
   closed and locked door he had no business thinking of that unexhibited
   horror which rogers called it the thing was a contaminationit had
   driven its maker mad and now even its picture was calling up
   imaginative terrors it was very obviously beyond that padlocked door
   of heavy planking those steps were certainly pure imagination

   then he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door flashing on
   his torch he saw nothing but the ancient sixpaneled portal in its
   proper position again he tried darkness and closed his eyes but there
   followed a harrowing illusion of creakingnot the guillotine this
   time but the slow furtive opening of the workroom door he would not
   scream once he screamed he would be lost there was a sort of padding
   or shuffling audible now and it was slowly advancing toward him he
   must retain command of himself had he not done so when the nameless
   brainshaped tried to close in on him? the shuffling crept nearer and
   his resolution failed he did not scream but merely gulped out a
   challenge

   who goes there? who are you? what do you want?

   there was no answer but the shuffling kept on jones did not know
   which he feared most to doturn on his flashlight or stay in the dark
   while the thing crept upon him this thing was different he felt
   profoundly from the other terrors of the evening his fingers and
   throat worked spasmodically silence was impossible and the suspense
   of utter blackness was beginning to be the most intolerable of all
   conditions again he cried out hystericallyhalt! who goes
   there?as he switched on the revealing beam of his torch then
   paralyzed by what he saw he dropped the flashlight and screamednot
   once but many times

   shuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic blasphemous form
   of a black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect its hide hung
   loosely upon its frame and its rugose deadeyed rudiment of a head
   swayed drunkenly from side to side its forepaws were extended with
   talons spread wide and its whole body was taut with murderous
   malignity despite its utter lack of facial expression after the
   screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped and in a moment had
   jones pinned to the floor there was no struggle for the watcher had
   fainted

   jones fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment for the
   nameless thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he
   began recovering consciousness what started him fully awake were the
   sounds which the thing was makingor rather the voice with which it
   was making them that voice was human and it was familiar only one
   living being could be behind the hoarse feverish accents which were
   chanting to an unknown horror

   iä! iä! it was howling i am coming o rhantegoth coming with the
   nourishment you have waited long and fed ill but now you shall have
   what was promised that and more for instead of orabona it will be one
   of high degree who has doubted you you shall crush and drain him with
   all his doubts and grow strong thereby and ever after among men he
   shall be shown as a monument to your glory rhantegoth infinite and
   invincible i am your slave and highpriest you are hungry and i
   shall provide i read the sign and have led you forth i shall feed you
   with blood and you shall feed me with power iä! shubniggurath! the
   goat with a thousand young!

   in an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from jones like a
   discarded cloak he was again master of his mind for he knew the very
   earthly and material peril he had to deal with this was no monster of
   fable but a dangerous madman it was rogers dressed in some nightmare
   covering of his own insane designing and about to make a frightful
   sacrifice to the devilgod he had fashioned out of wax clearly he
   must have entered the workroom from the read courtyard donned his
   disguise and then advance to seize his neatlytrapped and fearbroken
   victim his strength was prodigious and if he was to be thwarted one
   must act quickly counting on the madmans confidence in his
   unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise while his grip
   was relatively lax the feel of a threshold told him he was crossing
   into the pitchblack workroom

   with the strength of mortal fear jones made a sudden spring from the
   halfrecumbent posture in which he was being dragged for an instant he
   was free of the astonished maniacs hands and in another instant a
   lucky lunge in the dark had put his own hands at his captors weirdly
   concealed throat simultaneously rogers gripped him again and without
   further preliminaries the two were locked in a desperate struggle of
   life and death jones athletic training without doubt was his sole
   salvation; for his mad assailant freed from every inhibition of fair
   play decency or even selfpreservation was an engine of savage
   destruction as formidable as a wolf or panther

   guttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark
   blood spurted clothing ripped and jones at last felt the actual
   throat of the maniac shorn of its spectral mask he spoke not a word
   but put every ounce of energy into the defence of his life rogers
   kicked gouged butted bit clawed and spatyet found strength to
   yelp out actual sentences at times most of his speech was in a
   ritualistic jargon full of references to it or rhantegoth and to
   jones overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries echoed from an
   infinite distance of demoniac snortics and bayings toward the last
   they were rolling on the floor overturning benches or striking against
   the walls and the brick foundations of the central meltingfurnace up
   to the very end jones could not be certain of saving himself but
   chance finally intervened in his favor a jab of his knee against
   rogers chest produced a general relaxation and a moment later he knew
   he had won

   though hardly able to hold himself up jones rose and stumbled about
   the walls seeking the lightswitchfor his flashlight was gone
   together with most of his clothing as he lurched along he dragged his
   limp opponent with him fearing a sudden attack when the madman came
   to finding the switchbox he fumbled till he had the right handle
   then as the wildly disordered workroom burst into sudden radiance he
   set about binding rogers with such cords and belts as he could easily
   find the fellows disguiseor what was left of itseemed to be made
   of a puzzling queer sort of leather for some reason it made jones
   flesh crawl to touch it and there seemed to be an alien rusty odor
   about it in the normal clothes beneath it was rogers keyring and
   this the exhausted victor seized as his final passport to freedom the
   shades at the small slitlike windows were all securely drawn and he
   let them remain so

   washing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink jones donned the
   most ordinarylooking and least illfitting clothes he could find on
   the costume hooks testing the door to the courtyard he found it
   fastened with a springlock which did not require a key from the
   inside he kept the keyring however to admit him on his return with
   aidfor plainly the thing to do was to call in an alienist there was
   no telephone in the museum but it would not take long to find an
   allnight restaurant or chemists shop where one could be had he had
   almost opened the door when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the
   room told him that rogerswhose visible injuries were confined to a
   long deep scratch down the left cheekhad regained consciousness

   fool! spawn of nothyidik and effluvium of kthun! son of the dogs
   that howl in the maelstrom of azathoth! you would have been sacred and
   immortal and now you are betraying it and its priest! bewarefor it
   is hungry! it would have been orabonathat damned treacherous dog
   ready to turn against me and itbut i give you the honor instead now
   you must both beware for it is not gentle without its priest

   iä! iä! vengeance is at hand! do you know you would have been
   immortal? look at the furnace! there is a fire ready to light and
   there is wax in the kettle i would have done with you as i have done
   with other once living forms hei! you who have vowed all my effigies
   are waxen would have become a waxen effigy yourself! the furnace was
   already! when it had had its fill and you were like that dog i showed
   you i would have made your flattened punctured fragments immortal!
   wax would have done it havent you said im a great artist? wax in
   every porewax over every square inch of youiä! iä! and ever after
   the world would have looked at your mangled carcass and wondered how i
   ever imagined and made such a thing! hei! and orabona would have come
   next and others after himand thus would my waxen family have grown!

   dogdo you still think i made all my effigies? why not say preserved?
   you know by this time the strange places ive been to and the strange
   things ive brought back cowardyou could never face the dimensional
   shambler whose hide i put on to scare youthe mere sight of it alive
   or even the fullfledged thought of it would kill you instantly with
   fright! iä! iä! it waits hungry for the blood that is the life!

   rogers propped against the wall swayed to and fro in his bonds

   see here jonesif i let you go will you let me go? it must be taken
   care of by its high priest orabona will be enough to keep it
   aliveand when he is finished i will make his fragments immortal in
   wax for the world to see it could have been you but you have rejected
   the honor i wont bother you again let me go and i will share with
   you the power that it will bring me iä! iä! great is rhantegoth! let
   me go! let me go! it is starving down there beyond that door and if it
   dies the old ones can never come back hei! hei! let me go!

   jones merely shook his head though the hideousness of the showmans
   imaginings revolted him rogers now staring wildly at the padlocked
   plank door thumped his head again and again against the brick wall and
   kicked with his tightly bound ankles jones was afraid he would injure
   himself and advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary
   object writhing rogers edged away from him and set up a series of
   frenetic ululations whose utter monstrous unhumanness was appalling
   and whose sheer volume was almost incredible it seemed impossible that
   any human throat could produce noises so loud and piercing and jones
   felt that if this continued there would be no need to telephone for
   aid it could not be long before a constable would investigate even
   granting that there were no listening neighbors in this deserted
   warehouse district

   wzayei! wzayei! howled the madman ykaa haa hoii
   rhantegothcthulhu fthagnei! ei! ei! ei!rhanteogth rhantegoth
   rhantegoth!

   the tautly trussed creature who had started squirming his way across
   the littered floor now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced
   knocking his head thunderously against it jones dreaded the task of
   binding him further and wished he were not so exhausted from his
   previous struggle this violent aftermath was getting hideously on his
   nerves and he began to feel a return of the nameless qualms he had
   felt in the dark everything about rogers and his museum was so
   hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life! it was
   loathsome to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which
   must at this very moment be lurking close at hand in the blackness
   beyond the heavy padlocked door

   at now something happened which sent an addition chill down jones
   spine and caused every haireven the tiny growth on the backs of his
   handsto bristle with a vague fright beyond classification rogers had
   suddenly stopped screaming and beating his head against the stout plank
   door and was straining up to a sitting position head cocked on one
   side as if listening intently for something all at once a smile of
   devilish triumph overspread his face and he began speaking
   intelligibly againthis time in a hoarse whisper contrasting oddly
   with his former stentorian howling

   listen fool! listen hard! it has heard me and is coming cant you
   hear it splashing out of its tank down there at the end of the runway?
   i dug it deep because there was nothing too good for it it is
   amphibious you knowyou saw the gills in the picture it came to the
   earth from leadgray yuggoth where the cities are under the warm deep
   sea it cant stand up in theretoo tallhas to sit down or crouch
   let me get my keyswe must let it out and kneel down before it then
   we will go out and find a dog or cator perhaps a drunken manto give
   it the nourishment it needs

   it was not what the madman said but the way he said it that
   disorganized jones so badly the utter insane confidence and sincerity
   in that crazed whisper were damnably contagious imagination such a
   stimulus could find an active menace in the devilish wax figure that
   lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking eyeing the door in unholy
   fascination jones notices that it bore several distinct cracks though
   no marks of violent treatment were visible on this side he wondered
   how large a room or closet lay behind it and how the waxen figure was
   arranged the maniacs idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all
   his other imaginings

   then in one terrible instant jones completely lost the power to draw
   a breath the leather belt he had seized for rogers further strapping
   fell from his limp hands and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from
   head to foot he might have known the place would drive him mad as it
   had driven rogersand now he was mad he was mad for he now harbored
   hallucinations more weird than any which had assailed him earlier that
   night the madman was bidding him hear the splashing of a mythical
   monster in a tank beyond the doorand now god help him he did hear
   it!

   rogers saw the spasm of horror reach jones face and transform it to a
   staring mask of fear he cackled

   at last fool you believe! at last you know! you hear it and it
   comes! get me my keys foolwe must do homage and serve it!

   but jones was past paying attention to any human words mad or sane
   phobic paralysis held him immobile and half conscious with wild images
   racing fantasmagorically though his helpless imagination there was a
   splashing there was padding or shuffling as of great wet paws on a
   solid surface something was approaching into his nostrils from the
   cracks in that nightmare plank door poured a noisome animal stench
   like and yet unlike that of the mammal cages at the zoological gardens
   in regents park

   he did not known where rogers was talking or not everything real had
   faded away and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations
   so unnatural that they became almost objective and remote from him he
   thought he heard a sniffing or snorting from the unknown gulf beyond
   the door and when a sudden baying trumpeting noise assailed his ears
   he could not feel sure that it came from the tightly bound maniac whose
   image swam uncertainly in his shaken vision the photograph of that
   accursed unseen wax thing persisted in floating through his
   consciousness such a thing had no right to exist had it not driven
   him mad?

   even as he reflected a fresh evidence of madness beset him something
   he thought was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door it
   was patting and pawing and pushing at the planks there was a thudding
   on the stout wood which grew louder and louder the stench was
   horrible and now the assault on that door from the inside was a
   malign determined pounding like the strokes of a batteringram there
   was an ominous crackinga splinteringa welling fetora falling
   planka black paw ending in a crablike claw   

   help! help! god help me!    aaaaaaa!   

   with intense effort jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of
   his fearparalysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight
   what he evidently did must have paralleled curiously the wild plunging
   flights of maddest nightmares; for he seems to have leaped across the
   disordered crypt at almost a single bound yanked open the outside
   door which closed and locked itself after him with a clatter sprung
   up the worn stone steps three at a time and raced frantically and
   aimlessly out of that dark cobblestoned court and through the squalid
   streets of southwark

   here the memory ends jones does not know how he got home and there is
   no evidence of his having hired a cab probably he raced all the way by
   blind instinctover waterloo bridge along the strand and charing
   cross and up haymarket and regent street to his own neighborhood he
   still had on the queer melange of museum costumes when he grew
   conscious enough to call the doctor

   a week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and
   walk in the open air

   but he had not told the specialists much over his whole experience
   hung a pall of madness and nightmare and he felt that silence was the
   only course when he was up he scanned intently all the papers which
   had accumulated since that hideous night but found no reference to
   anything queer at the museum how much after all had been reality?
   where did reality end and morbid dream begin? had his mind gone wholly
   to pieces in that dark exhibition chamber and had the whole fight with
   rogers been a fantasm of fever? it would help to put him on his feet if
   he could settle some of these maddening points he must have seen that
   damnable photograph of the wax image called it for no brain but
   rogers could ever have conceived such a blasphemy

   it was a fortnight before he dared to enter southwark street again he
   went in the middle of the morning when there was the greatest amount
   of sane wholesome activity around the ancient crumbling shops and
   warehouses the museums sign was still there and as he approached he
   saw that the place was still open the gateman nodded in pleasant
   recognition as he summoned up the courage to enter and in the vaulted
   chamber below an attendant touched his cap cheerfully perhaps
   everything had been a dream would he dare to knock at the door of the
   workroom and look for rogers?

   then orabona advanced to greet him his dark sleek face was a trifle
   sardonic but jones felt that he was not unfriendly he spoke with a
   trace of accent

   good morning mr jones it is some time since we have seen you here
   did you wish mr rogers? im sorry but he is away he had word of
   business in america and had to go yes it was very sudden i am in
   charge nowhere and at the house i try to maintain mr rogers high
   standardtill he is back

   the foreigner smiledperhaps from affability alone jones scarcely
   knew how to reply but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the
   day after his last visit orabona seemed greatly amused by the
   questions and took considerable care in framing his replies

   oh yes mr jonesthe 28th of last month i remember it for many
   reasons in the morningbefore mr rogers got here you understandi
   found the workroom in quite a mess there was a great deal ofcleaning
   upto do there had beenlate work you see important new specimen
   given its secondary baking process i took complete charge when i came

   it was a hard specimen to preparebut of course mr rogers had taught
   me a great deal he is as you know a very great artist when he came
   he helped me complete the specimenhelped very materially i assure
   youbut he left soon without even greeting the men as i tell you he
   was called away suddenly there were important chemical reactions
   involved they made loud noisesin fact some teamsters in the court
   outside fancy they heard several pistol shotsvery amusing idea!

   as for the new specimenthat matter is very unfortunate it is a
   great masterpiecedesigned and made you understand by mr rogers he
   will see about it when he gets back

   again orabona smiled

   the police you know we put it on display a week ago and there were
   two or three faintings one poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front
   of it you see its a triflestrongerthan the rest larger for one
   thing of course it was in the adult alcove the next day a couple of
   men from scotland yard looked it over and said it was too morbid to be
   shown said wed have to remove it it was a tremendous shamesuch a
   masterpiece of artbut i didnt feel justified in appealing to the
   courts in mr rogers absence he would not like so much publicity with
   the police nowbut when he gets backwhen he gets back

   for some reason or other jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and
   repulsion but orabona was continuing

   you are a connoisseur mr jones i am sure i violate no law in
   offering you a private view it may besubject of course to mr
   rogers wishesthat we shall destroy the specimen some daybut that
   would be a crime

   jones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee
   precipitately but orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an
   artists enthusiasm the adult alcove crowded with nameless horrors
   held no visitors in the farther corner a large niche had been
   curtained off and to this the smiling assistant advanced

   you must know mr jones that the title of this specimen is the
   sacrifice to rhantegoth 

   jones started violently but orabona appeared not to notice

   the shapeless colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends
   which mr rogers had studied all nonsense of course as youve so
   often assured mr rogers it is supposed to have come from outer space
   and to have lived in the arctic three million years ago it treated its
   sacrifices rather peculiarly and horribly as you shall see mr rogers
   had made it fiendishly lifelikeeven to the face of the victim

   now trembling violently jones clung to the brass railing in front of
   the curtained niche he almost reached out to stop orabona when he saw
   the curtain beginning to swing aside but some conflicting impulse held
   him back the foreigner smiled triumphantly

   behold!

   jones reeled in spite of his grip on the railing

   god!great god!

   fully ten feet high despite a shambling crouching attitude expressive
   of infinite cosmic malignancy a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was
   shown starting forward from a cyclopean ivory throne covered with
   grotesque carvings in the central pair of its six legs it bore a
   crushed flattened distorted bloodless thing riddled with a million
   punctures and in places seared as with some pungent acid only the
   mangled head of the victim lolling upside down at one side revealed
   that it represented something once human

   the monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain
   hellish photograph that damnable print had been all too faithful; yet
   it could not carry the full horror which lay in the gigantic actuality
   the globular torsothe bubblelike suggestion of a headthe three
   fishy eyesthe footlong proboscisthe bulging gillsthe monstrous
   capillation of asplike suckersthe six sinuous limbs with their black
   paws and crablike clawsgod! the familiarity of the black paw ending
   in a crablike claw!   

   orabonas smile was utterly damnable jones choked and stared at the
   hideous exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and
   disturbed him what halfrevealed horror was holding and forcing him to
   look longer and search out details? this had driven rogers mad   
   rogers supreme artist    said they werent artificial   

   then he localized the thing that held him it was the crushed waxen
   victims lolling head and something that it implied this head was not
   entirely devoid of a face and that face was familiar it was like the
   mad face of poor rogers jones peered closer hardly knowing why he was
   driven to do so wasnt it natural for a mad egotist to mold his own
   features into his masterpiece? was there anything more that
   subconscious vision had seized on and suppressed in sheer terror?

   the wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity
   those punctureshow perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds
   somehow inflicted on that poor dog! but there was something more on
   the left cheek one could trace an irregularity which seemed outside the
   general schemeas if the sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of
   his first modelling the more jones looked at it the more mysteriously
   it horrified himand then suddenly he remembered a circumstance
   which brought his horror to a head that night of hideousnessthe
   tusslethe bound madmanand the long deep scratch down the left
   cheek of the actual living rogers   

   jones releasing his desperate clutch on the railing sank in a total
   faint

   orabona continued to smile

   the hound  (1924)
   by h p lovecraft
      documentation for the textinfo template
       information about this edition

   first published in weird tales (february 1924)
   10835the houndh p lovecraft1924

   in my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and
   flapping and a faint distant baying as of some gigantic hound it is
   not dreamit is not i fear even madnessfor too much has already
   happened to give me these merciful doubts

   st john is a mangled corpse; i alone know why and such is my knowledge
   that i am about to blow out my brains for fear i shall be mangled in
   the same way down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch phantasy
   sweeps the black shapeless nemesis that drives me to
   selfannihilation

   may heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so
   monstrous a fate! wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world;
   where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale st john
   and i had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual
   movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui the enigmas
   of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the preraphaelites all were
   ours in their time but each new mood was drained too soon of its
   diverting novelty and appeal

   only the somber philosophy of the decadents could help us and this we
   found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diablism of our
   penetrations baudelaire and huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills
   till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of
   unnatural personal experiences and adventures it was this frightful
   emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which
   even in my present fear i mention with shame and timiditythat hideous
   extremity of human outrage the abhorred practice of graverobbing

   i cannot reveal the details of our shocking expedition or catalogue
   even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we
   jointly dwelt alone and servantless our museum was a blasphemous
   unthinkable place where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we
   had assembled an universe of terror and a secret room far far
   underground; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx
   vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light and
   hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the
   line of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black
   hangings through these pipes came at will the odors our moods most
   craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies; sometimes the
   narcotic incense of imagined eastern shrines of the kingly dead and
   sometimeshow i shudder to recall it!the frightful soulupheaving
   stenches of the uncoveredgrave

   around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique
   mummies alternating with comely lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and
   cured by the taxidermists art and with headstones snatched from the
   oldest churchyards of the world niches here and there contained skulls
   of all shapes and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution
   there one might find the rotting bald pates of famous noblemen and
   the flesh and radiantly golden heads of newburied children

   statues and painting there were all of fiendish subjects and some
   executed by st john and myself a locked portfolio bound in tanned
   human skin held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was
   rumored goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge there were
   nauseous musical instruments stringed brass woodwind on which st
   john and i sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and
   cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony
   cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of
   tombloot ever assembled by human madness and perversity it is of this
   loot in particular that i must not speak thank god i had the courage
   to destroy it long before i thought of destroying myself!

   the predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable
   treasures were always artistically memorable events we were no vulgar
   ghouls but worked only under certain conditions of mood landscape
   environment weather season and moonlight these pastimes were to us
   the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression and we gave their
   details a fastidious technical care an inappropriate hour a jarring
   lighting effect or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod would almost
   totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the
   exhumation of some ominous grinning secret of the earth our quest for
   novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiatest john
   was always the leader and he it was who led the way at last to that
   mocking accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable
   doom

   by what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible holland
   churchyard? i think it was the dark rumor and legendry the tales of
   one buried for five centuries who had himself been a ghoul in his time
   and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre i can recall the
   scene in these final momentsthe pale autumnal moon over the graves
   casting long horrible shadows; the grotesque trees drooping sullenly
   to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs; the vast legions
   of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the antique
   ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the
   phosphorescent insects that danced like deathfires under the yews in a
   distant corner; the odors of mould vegetation and less explicable
   things that mingled feebly with the nightwind from over far swamps and
   seas; and worst of all the faint deeptoned baying of some gigantic
   hound which we could neither see nor definitely place as we heard this
   suggestion of baying we shuddered remembering the tales of the
   peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in
   this self same spot torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some
   unspeakable beast

   i remember how we delved in the ghouls grave with our spades and how
   we thrilled at the picture of ourselves the grave the pale watching
   moon the horrible shadows the grotesque trees the titanic bats the
   antique church the dancing deathfires the sickening odors the
   gently moaning nightwind and the strange halfheard directionless
   baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure

   then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould and beheld a
   rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long
   undisturbed ground it was incredibly tough and thick but so old that
   we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it held

   muchamazingly muchwas left of the object despite the lapse of five
   hundred years the skeleton though crushed in places by the jaws of
   the thing that had killed it held together with surprising firmness
   and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long firm teeth and
   its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our
   own in the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design which
   had apparently been worn around the sleepers neck it was the oddly
   conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound or sphinx with a
   semicanine face and was exquisitely carved in antique oriental
   fashion from a small piece of green jade the expression of its
   features was repellent in the extreme savoring at once of death
   bestiality and malevolence around the base was an inscription in
   characters which neither st john nor i could identify; and on the
   bottom like a makers seal was graven a grotesque and formidable
   skull

   immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it;
   that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave
   even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it but as
   we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar alien
   it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers
   know but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden
   necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred; the ghastly soulsymbol of
   the corpseeating cult of inaccessible leng in central asia all too
   well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old arab
   daemonologist; lineaments he wrote drawn from some obscure
   supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed
   at the dead

   seizing the green jade object we gave a last glance at the bleached
   and caverneyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found
   it as we hastened from the abhorrent spot the stolen amulet in st
   johns pocket we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the
   earth we had so lately rifled as if seeking for some cursed and unholy
   nourishment but the autumn moon shone weak and pale and we could not
   be sure

   so too as we sailed the next day away from holland to our home we
   thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the
   background but the autumn wind moaned sad and wan and we could not be
   sure

   less than a week after our return to england strange things began to
   happen we lived as recluses; devoid of friends alone and without
   servants in a few rooms of an ancient manorhouse on a bleak and
   unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock
   of the visitor

   now however we were troubled by what seemed to be a frequent fumbling
   in the night not only around the doors but around the windows also
   upper as well as lower once we fancied that a large opaque body
   darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it and
   another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far
   off on each occasion investigation revealed nothing and we began to
   ascribe the occurrences to imagination which still prolonged in our
   ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the holland
   churchyard the jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum and
   sometimes we burned a strangely scented candle before it we read much
   in alhazreds necronomicon about its properties and about the relation
   of ghosts souls to the objects it symbolized; and were disturbed by
   what we read

   then terror came

   on the night of september 24 19 i heard a knock at my chamber door
   fancying it st johns i bade the knocker enter but was answered only
   by a shrill laugh there was no one in the corridor when i aroused st
   john from his sleep he professed entire ignorance of the event and
   became as worried as i it was the night that the faint distant baying
   over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality

   four days later whilst we were both in the hidden museum there came a
   low cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret
   library staircase our alarm was now divided for besides our fear of
   the unknown we had always entertained a dread that our grisly
   collection might be discovered extinguishing all lights we proceeded
   to the door and threw it suddenly open; whereupon we felt an
   unaccountable rush of air and heard as if receding far away a queer
   combination of rustling tittering and articulate chatter whether we
   were mad dreaming or in our senses we did not try to determine we
   only realized with the blackest of apprehensions that the apparently
   disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the dutch language

   after that we lived in growing horror and fascination mostly we held
   to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural
   excitements but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatize ourselves as
   the victims of some creeping and appalling doom bizarre manifestations
   were now too frequent to count our lonely house was seemingly alive
   with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess
   and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the windswept moor
   always louder and louder on october 29 we found in the soft earth
   underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible
   to describe they were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which
   haunted the old manorhouse in unprecedented and increasing numbers

   the horror reached a culmination on november 18 when st john walking
   home after dark from the dismal railway station was seized by some
   frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons his screams had
   reached the house and i had hastened to the terrible scene in time to
   hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted
   against the rising moon

   my friend was dying when i spoke to him and he could not answer
   coherently all he could do was to whisper the amuletthat damned
   thing

   then he collapsed an inert mass of mangled flesh

   i buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens and
   mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life
   and as i pronounced the last daemoniac sentence i heard afar on the
   moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound the moon was up but i
   dared not look at it and when i saw on the dimlighted moor a
   widenebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound i shut my eyes and
   threw myself face down upon the ground when i arose trembling i know
   not how much later i staggered into the house and made shocking
   obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade

   being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor i
   departed on the following day for london taking with me the amulet
   after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection
   in the museum but after three nights i heard the baying again and
   before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark
   one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air i
   saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the
   water a wind stronger than the nightwind rushed by and i knew that
   what had befallen st john must soon befall me

   the next day i carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for
   holland what mercy i might gain by returning the thing to its silent
   sleeping owner i knew not; but i felt that i must try any step
   conceivably logical what the hound was and why it had pursued me
   were questions still vague; but i had first heard the baying in that
   ancient churchyard and every subsequent event including st johns
   dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the
   amulet accordingly i sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when
   at an inn in rotterdam i discovered that thieves had despoiled me of
   this sole means of salvation

   the baying was loud that evening and in the morning i read of a
   nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city the rabble were in
   terror for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the
   foulest previous crime of the neighborhood in a squalid thieves den
   an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left
   no trace and those around had heard all night a faint deep insistent
   note as of a gigantic hound

   so at last i stood again in the unwholesome churchyard where a pale
   winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to
   meet the withered frosty grass and cracking slabs and the ivied
   church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky and the
   nightwind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas
   the baying was very faint now and it ceased altogether as i approached
   the ancient grave i had once violated and frightened away an
   abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around
   it

   i know not why i went thither unless to pray or gibber out insane
   pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within; but
   whatever my reason i attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation
   partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself
   excavation was much easier than i expected though at one point i
   encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture darted down out
   of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the graveearth until i
   killed him with a blow of my spade finally i reached the rotting
   oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover this is the last
   rational act i ever performed

   for crouched within that centuried coffin embraced by a closepacked
   nightmare retinue of huge sinewy sleeping bats was the bony thing my
   friend and i had robbed; not clean and placid as we had seen it then
   but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair and
   leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp
   ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom
   and when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep sardonic bay as of
   some gigantic hound and i saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the
   lost and fateful amulet of green jade i merely screamed and ran away
   idiotically my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical
   laughter

   madness rides the starwind    claws and teeth sharpened on
   centuries of corpses    dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats
   from nighblack ruins of buried temples of belial    now as the
   baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder and
   the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed webwings circles
   closer and closer i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is
   my only refuge from the unnamed and unnameable

     tis a grovecircled dwelling
       set close to a hill
     where the branches are telling
       strange legends of ill;
     over timbers so old
       that they breathe of the dead
     crawl the vines green and cold
       by strange nourishment fed;
   and no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank
   slimy bed

     in the gardens are growing
       tall blossoms and fair
     each pallid bloom throwing
       perfume on the air;
     but the afternoon sun
       with its shining red rays
     makes the picture loom dun
       on the curious gaze
   and above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless
   days

     the rank grasses are waving
       on terrace and lawn
     dim memories savouring
       of things that have gone;
     the stones of the walks
       are encrusted and wet
     and a strange spirit stalks
       when the red sun has set
   and the soul of the watcher is filld with faint pictures he fain would
   forget

     it was in the hot junetime
       i stood by that scene
     when the gold rays of noontime
       beat bright on the green
     but i shiverd with cold
       groping feebly for light
     as a picture unrolld 
       and my agespanning sight
   saw the time i had been there before flash like fulgury out of the
   night

   few persons know the inside of the clarendon story or even that there
   is an inside not reached by the newspapers it was a san francisco
   sensation in the days before the fire both because of the panic and
   menace that kept it company and because of its close linkage with the
   governor of the state governor dalton it will be recalled was
   clarendons best friend and later married his sister neither dalton
   nor mrs dalton would ever discuss the painful affair but somehow the
   facts have leaked out to a limited circle but for that and for the
   years which have given a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the
   actors one would still pause before probing into secrets so strictly
   guarded at the time

   the appointment of dr alfred clarendon as medical director of san
   quentin penitentiary in 189 was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm
   throughout california san francisco had at last the honour of
   harbouring one of the greatest biologists and physicians of the period
   and solid pathological leaders from all over the world might be
   expected to flock thither to study his methods profit by his advice
   and researches and learn how to cope with their own local problems
   california almost over night would become a centre of medical
   scholarship with earthwide influence and reputation

   governor dalton anxious to spread the news in its fullest
   significance saw to it that the press carried ample and dignified
   accounts of his new appointee pictures of dr clarendon and his new
   home near old goat hill sketches of his career and manifold honours
   and popular accounts of his salient scientific discoveries were all
   presented in the principal california dailies till the public soon
   felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studies of pyemia in
   india of the pest in china and of every sort of kindred disorder
   elsewhere would soon enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of
   revolutionary importancea basic antitoxin combating the whole febrile
   principle at its very source and ensuring the ultimate conquest and
   extirpation of fever in all its diverse forms

   back of the appointment stretched an extended and not wholly unromantic
   history of early friendship long separation and dramatically renewed
   acquaintance james dalton and the clarendon family had been friends in
   new york ten years beforefriends and more than friends since the
   doctors only sister georgina was the sweetheart of daltons youth
   while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his
   protégé in the days of school and college the father of alfred and
   georgina a wall street pirate of the ruthless elder breed had known
   daltons father well; so well indeed that he had finally stripped him
   of all he possessed in a memorable afternoons fight on the stock
   exchange dalton senior hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give
   his one adored child the benefit of his insurance had promptly blown
   out his brains; but james had not sought to retaliate it was as he
   viewed it all in the game; and he wished no harm to the father of the
   girl he meant to marry and of the budding young scientist whose admirer
   and protector he had been throughout their years of fellowship and
   study instead he turned to the law established himself in a small
   way and in due course of time asked old clarendon for georginas
   hand

   old clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly vowing that no pauper
   and upstart lawyer was fit to be his soninlaw; and a scene of
   considerable violence had occurred james telling the wrinkled
   freebooter at last what he ought to have been told long before had
   left the house and the city in a high temper; and was embarked within a
   month upon the california life which was to lead him to the
   governorship through many a fight with ring and politician his
   farewells to alfred and georgina had been brief and he had never known
   the aftermath of that scene in the clarendon library only by a day did
   he miss the news of old clarendons death from apoplexy and by so
   missing it changed the course of his whole career he had not written
   georgina in the decade that followed; knowing her loyalty to her
   father and waiting till his own fortune and position might remove all
   obstacles to the match nor had he sent any word to alfred whose calm
   indifference in the face of affection and heroworship had always
   savoured of conscious destiny and the selfsufficiency of genius
   secure in the ties of a constancy rare even then he had worked and
   risen with thoughts only of the future; still a bachelor and with a
   perfect intuitive faith that georgina also was waiting

   in this faith dalton was not deceived wondering perhaps why no message
   ever came georgina found no romance save in her dreams and
   expectations; and in the course of time became busy with the new
   responsibilities brought by her brothers rise to greatness alfreds
   growth had not belied the promise of his youth and the slim boy had
   darted quietly up the steps of science with a speed and permanence
   almost dizzying to contemplate lean and ascetic with steelrimmed
   pincenez and pointed brown beard dr alfred clarendon was an
   authority at twentyfive and an international figure at thirty
   careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of genius he depended
   vastly on the care and management of his sister and was secretly
   thankful that her memories of james had kept her from other and more
   tangible alliances

   georgina conducted the business and household of the great
   bacteriologist and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of
   fever she bore patiently with his eccentricities calmed his
   occasional bursts of fanaticism and healed those breaches with his
   friends which now and then resulted from his unconcealed scorn of
   anything less than a singleminded devotion to pure truth and its
   progress clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary
   folk; for he never tired of depreciating the service of the individual
   as contrasted with the service of mankind as a whole and in censuring
   men of learning who mingled domestic life or outside interests with
   their pursuit of abstract science his enemies called him a bore; but
   his admirers pausing before the white heat of ecstasy into which he
   would work himself became almost ashamed of ever having any standards
   or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed knowledge
   the doctors travels were extensive and georgina generally accompanied
   him on the shorter ones three times however he had taken long lone
   jaunts to strange and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers
   and halffabulous plagues; for he knew that it is out of the unknown
   lands of cryptic and immemorial asia that most of the earths diseases
   spring on each of these occasions he had brought back curious
   mementoes which added to the eccentricity of his home not least among
   which was the needlessly large staff of thibetan servants picked up
   somewhere in utsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard
   but amidst which clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of
   black fever these men taller than most thibetans and clearly
   belonging to a stock but little investigated in the outside world were
   of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder whether the doctor had
   sought to symbolise in them the anatomical models of his college years
   their aspect in the loose black silk robes of bonpa priests which he
   chose to give them was grotesque in the highest degree; and there was
   an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced
   their air of fantasy and gave georgina a queer awed feeling of having
   stumbled into the pages of vathek or the arabian nights

   but queerest of all was the general factotum or clinicman whom
   clarendon addressed as surama and whom he had brought back with him
   after a long stay in northern africa during which he had studied
   certain odd intermittent fevers among the mysterious saharan tuaregs
   whose descent from the primal race of lost atlantis is an old
   archaeological rumour surama a man of great intelligence and
   seemingly inexhaustible erudition was as morbidly lean as the thibetan
   servants; with swarthy parchmentlike skin drawn so tightly over his
   bald pate and hairless face that every line of the skull stood out in
   ghastly prominencethis deathshead effect being heightened by
   lustrelessly burning black eyes set with a depth which left to common
   visibility only a pair of dark vacant sockets unlike the ideal
   subordinate he seemed despite his impassive features to spend no
   effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed instead he carried
   about an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement accompanied at
   certain moments by a deep guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle
   which has just torn to pieces some furry animal and is ambling away
   toward the sea his race appeared to be caucasian but could not be
   classified more closely than that some of clarendons friends thought
   he looked like a highcaste hindoo notwithstanding his accentless
   speech while many agreed with georginawho disliked himwhen she
   gave her opinion that a pharaohs mummy if miraculously brought to
   life would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeleton

   dalton absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from
   eastern interests through the peculiar selfsufficiency of the old
   west had not followed the meteoric rise of his former comrade;
   clarendon had actually heard nothing of one so far outside his chosen
   world of science as the governor being of independent and even of
   abundant means the clarendons had for many years stuck to their old
   manhattan mansion in east nineteenth street whose ghosts must have
   looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of surama and the thibetans
   then through the doctors wish to transfer his base of medical
   observation the great change had suddenly come and they had crossed
   the continent to take up a secluded life in san francisco; buying the
   gloomy old bannister place near goat hill overlooking the bay and
   establishing their strange household in a rambling frenchroofed relic
   of midvictorian design and goldrush parvenu display set amidst
   highwalled grounds in a region still half suburban

   dr clarendon though better satisfied than in new york still felt
   cramped for lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological
   theories unworldly as he was he had never thought of using his
   reputation as an influence to gain public appointment; though more and
   more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or
   a charitable institutiona prison almshouse or hospitalwould give
   him a field of sufficient width to complete his researches and make his
   discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at large

   then he had run into james dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in
   market street as the governor was swinging out of the royal hotel
   georgina had been with him and an almost instant recognition had
   heightened the drama of the reunion mutual ignorance of one anothers
   progress had bred long explanation and histories and clarendon was
   pleased to find that he had so important an official for a friend
   dalton and georgina exchanging many a glance felt more than a trace
   of their youthful tenderness; and a friendship was then and there
   revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of
   confidences

   james dalton learned of his old protégés need for political
   appointment and sought true to his protective role of school and
   college days to devise some means of giving little alf the needed
   position and scope he had it is true wide appointive powers; but the
   legislatures constant attacks and encroachments forced him to exercise
   these with the utmost discretion at length however scarcely three
   months after the sudden reunion the foremost institutional medical
   office in the state fell vacant weighing all the elements with care
   and conscious that his friends achievements and reputation would
   justify the most substantial rewards the governor felt at last able to
   act formalities were few and on the eighth of november 189 dr
   alfred schuyler clarendon became medical director of the california
   state penitentiary at san quentin

   ii

   in scarcely more than a month the hopes of dr clarendons admirers
   were amply fulfilled sweeping changes in methods brought to the
   prisons medical routine an efficiency never before dreamed of; and
   though the subordinates were naturally not without jealousy they were
   obliged to admit the magical results of a really great mans
   superintendence then came a time where mere appreciation might well
   have grown to devout thankfulness at a providential conjunction of
   time place and man; for one morning dr jones came to his new chief
   with a grave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could
   not but identify as that selfsame black fever whose germ clarendon had
   found and classified

   dr clarendon shewed no surprise but kept on at the writing before
   him

   i know he said evenly; i came across that case yesterday im glad
   you recognised it put the man in a separate ward though i dont
   believe this fever is contagious

   dr jones with his own opinion of the maladys contagiousness was
   glad of this deference to caution; and hastened to execute the order
   upon his return clarendon rose to leave declaring that he would
   himself take charge of the case alone disappointed in his wish to
   study the great mans methods and technique the junior physician
   watched his chief stride away toward the lone ward where he had placed
   the patient more critical of the new regime than at any time since
   admiration had displaced his first jealous pangs

   reaching the ward clarendon entered hastily glancing at the bed and
   stepping back to see how far dr joness obvious curiosity might have
   led him then finding the corridor still vacant he shut the door and
   turned to examine the sufferer the man was a convict of a peculiarly
   repulsive type and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony
   his features were frightfully contracted and his knees drawn sharply
   up in the mute desperation of the stricken clarendon studied him
   closely raising his tightly shut eyelids took his pulse and
   temperature and finally dissolving a tablet in water forced the
   solution between the sufferers lips before long the height of the
   attack abated as shewn by the relaxing body and returning normality of
   expression and the patient began to breathe more easily then by a
   soft rubbing of the ears the doctor caused the man to open his eyes
   there was life in them for they moved from side to side though they
   lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the image of the soul
   clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had brought feeling
   behind him the power of an allcapable science he had long known of
   this case and had snatched the victim from death with the work of a
   moment another hour and this man would have goneyet jones had seen
   the symptoms for days before discovering them and having discovered
   them did not know what to do

   mans conquest of disease however cannot be perfect clarendon
   assuring the dubious trustynurses that the fever was not contagious
   had had the patient bathed sponged in alcohol and put to bed; but was
   told the next morning that the case was lost the man had died after
   midnight in the most intense agony and with such cries and distortions
   of face that the nurses were driven almost to panic the doctor took
   this news with his usual calm whatever his scientific feelings may
   have been and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime then
   with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders he made the usual rounds of
   the penitentiary

   two days later the prison was hit again three men came down at once
   this time and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever
   epidemic was under way clarendon having adhered so firmly to his
   theory of noncontagiousness suffered a distinct loss of prestige and
   was handicapped by the refusal of the trustynurses to attend the
   patients theirs was not the soulfree devotion of those who sacrifice
   themselves to science and humanity they were convicts serving only
   because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy and when the
   price became too great they preferred to resign the privileges

   but the doctor was still master of the situation consulting with the
   warden and sending urgent messages to his friend the governor he saw
   to it that special rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to
   the convicts for the dangerous nursing service; and by this method
   succeeded in getting a very fair quota of volunteers he was steeled
   for action now and nothing could shake his poise and determination
   additional cases brought only a curt nod and he seemed a stranger to
   fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone
   home of sadness and evil more than forty cases developed within
   another week and nurses had to be brought from the city clarendon
   went home very seldom at this stage often sleeping on a cot in the
   wardens quarters and always giving himself up with typical abandon to
   the service of medicine and of mankind

   then came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse
   san francisco news will out and the menace of black fever spread over
   the town like a fog from the bay reporters trained in the doctrine of
   sensation first used their imagination without restraint and gloried
   when at last they were able to produce a case in the mexican quarter
   which a local physicianfonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic
   welfarepronounced black fever

   that was the last straw frantic at the thought of the crawling death
   so close upon them the people of san francisco went mad en masse and
   embarked upon that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to
   hear over busy wires ferries and rowboats excursion steamers and
   launches railways and cable cars bicycles and carriages movingvans
   and work carts all were pressed into instant and frenzied service
   sausalito and tamalpais as lying in the direction of san quentin
   shared in the flight; while housing space in oakland berkeley and
   alameda rose to fabulous prices tent colonies sprang up and
   improvised villages lined the crowded southward highways from millbrae
   to san jose many sought refuge with friends in sacramento while the
   frightshaken residue forced by various causes to stay behind could do
   little more than maintain the basic necessities of a nearly dead city

   business save for quack doctors with sure cures and preventives
   for use against the fever fell rapidly to the vanishingpoint at
   first the saloons offered medicated drinks but soon found that the
   populace preferred to be duped by charlatans of more professional
   aspect in strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one
   anothers faces to glimpse possible plague symptoms and shopkeepers
   began more and more to refuse admission to their clientele each
   customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace legal and judicial
   machinery began to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks
   succumbed one by one to the urge for flight even the doctors deserted
   in large numbers many of them pleading the need of vacations among the
   mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the state schools and
   colleges theatres and cafés restaurants and saloons all gradually
   closed their doors; and in a single week san francisco lay prostrate
   and inert with only its light power and water service even half
   normal with newspapers in skeletonic form and with a crippled parody
   on transportation maintained by the horse and cable cars

   this was the lowest ebb it could not last long for courage and
   observation are not altogether dead in mankind; and sooner or later the
   nonexistence of any widespread black fever epidemic outside san
   quentin became too obvious a fact to deny notwithstanding several
   actual cases and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary
   suburban tent colonies the leaders and editors of the community
   conferred and took action enlisting in their service the very
   reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble but
   now turning their sensation first avidity into more constructive
   channels editorials and fictitious interviews appeared telling of dr
   clarendons complete control of the disease and of the absolute
   impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison walls reiteration and
   circulation slowly did their work and gradually a slim backward
   trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous refluent stream one of
   the first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversy of
   the approved acrimonious kind attempting to fix blame for the panic
   wherever the various participants thought it belonged the returning
   doctors jealously strengthened by their timely vacations began
   striking at clarendon assuring the public that they as well as he
   would keep the fever in leash and censuring him for not doing even
   more to check its spread within san quentin

   clarendon had they averred permitted far more deaths than were
   necessary the veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever
   contagion; and if this renowned savant did not do it it was clearly
   because he chose for scientific reasons to study the final effects of
   the disease rather than to prescribe properly and save the victims
   this policy they insinuated might be proper enough among convicted
   murderers in a penal institution but it would not do in san francisco
   where life was still a precious and sacred thing thus they went on
   and the papers were glad to publish all they wrote since the sharpness
   of the campaign in which dr clarendon would doubtless join would
   help to obliterate confusion and restore confidence among the people

   but clarendon did not reply he only smiled while his singular
   clinicman surama indulged in many a deep testudinous chuckle he was
   at home more nowadays so that reporters began besieging the gate of
   the great wall the doctor had built around his house instead of
   pestering the wardens office at san quentin results though were
   equally meagre; for surama formed an impassable barrier between the
   doctor and the outer worldeven after the reporters had got into the
   grounds the newspaper men getting access to the front hall had
   glimpses of clarendons singular entourage and made the best they could
   in a writeup of surama and the queer skeletonic thibetans
   exaggeration of course occurred in every fresh article and the net
   effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician
   most persons hate the unusual and hundreds who could have excused
   heartlessness or incompetence stood ready to condemn the grotesque
   taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eight blackrobed
   orientals

   early in january an especially persistent young man from the observer
   climbed the moated eightfoot brick wall in the rear of the clarendon
   grounds and began a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which
   trees concealed from the front walk with quick alert brain he took in
   everythingthe rosearbour the aviaries the animal cages where all
   sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guineapigs might be seen and heard
   the stout wooden clinic building with barred windows in the northwest
   corner of the yardand bent searching glances throughout the thousand
   square feet of intramural privacy a great article was brewing and he
   would have escaped unscathed but for the barking of dick georgina
   clarendons gigantic and beloved st bernard surama instant in his
   response had the youth by the collar before a protest could be
   uttered and was presently shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat and
   dragging him through the trees to the front yard and the gate

   breathless explanations and quavering demands to see dr clarendon were
   useless surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on suddenly a
   positive fright crept over the dapper scribe and he began to wish
   desperately that this unearthly creature would speak if only to prove
   that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this
   planet he became deathly sick and strove not to glimpse the eyes
   which he knew must lie at the base of those gaping black sockets soon
   he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through; in
   another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly
   and muddily in the ditch which clarendon had had dug around the entire
   length of the wall fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive
   gate slam shut and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the
   forbidding portal then as he turned to go a soft sound grated behind
   him and through a small wicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of
   surama and heard the echoes of a deepvoiced bloodfreezing chuckle

   this young man feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been
   rougher than he deserved resolved to revenge himself upon the
   household responsible for his treatment accordingly he prepared a
   fictitious interview with dr clarendon supposed to be held in the
   clinic building during which he was careful to describe the agonies of
   a dozen black fever patients whom his imagination ranged on orderly
   rows of couches his masterstroke was the picture of one especially
   pathetic sufferer gasping for water while the doctor held a glass of
   the sparkling fluid just out of his reach in a scientific attempt to
   determine the effect of a tantalising emotion on the course of the
   disease this invention was followed by paragraphs of insinuating
   comment so outwardly respectful that it bore a double venom dr
   clarendon was the article ran undoubtedly the greatest and most
   singleminded scientist in the world; but science is no friend to
   individual welfare and one would not like to have ones gravest ills
   drawn out and aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on some
   point of abstract truth life is too short for that

   altogether the article was diabolically skilful and succeeded in
   horrifying nine readers out of ten against dr clarendon and his
   supposed methods other papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its
   substance taking the cue it offered and commencing a series of
   faked interviews which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy in
   no case however did the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction
   he had no time to waste on fools and liars and cared little for the
   esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised when james dalton
   telegraphed his regrets and offered aid clarendon replied with an
   almost boorish curtness he did not heed the barking of dogs and could
   not bother to muzzle them nor would he thank anyone for messing with a
   matter wholly beneath notice silent and contemptuous he continued his
   duties with tranquil evenness

   but the young reporters spark had done its work san francisco was
   insane again and this time as much with rage as with fear sober
   judgment became a lost art; and though no second exodus occurred there
   ensued a reign of vice and recklessness born of desperation and
   suggesting parallel phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence hatred
   ran riot against the man who had found the disease and was struggling
   to restrain it and a lightheaded public forgot his great services to
   knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment they
   seemed in their blindness to hate him in person rather than the
   plague which had come to their breezecleaned and usually healthy city

   then the young reporter playing in the neronic fire he had kindled
   added a crowning personal touch of his own remembering the indignities
   he had suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinicman he prepared
   a masterly article on the home and environment of dr clarendon giving
   especial prominence to surama whose very aspect he declared sufficient
   to scare the healthiest person into any sort of fever he tried to make
   the gaunt chuckler appear equally ridiculous and terrible succeeding
   best perhaps in the latter half of his intention since a tide of
   horror always welled up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to
   the creature he collected all the rumours current about the man
   elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputed scholarship and hinted
   darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and
   aeonweighted africa wherein dr clarendon had found him

   georgina who followed the papers closely felt crushed and hurt by
   these attacks upon her brother but james dalton who called often at
   the house did his best to comfort her in this he was warm and
   sincere; for he wished not only to console the woman he loved but to
   utter some measure of the reverence he had always felt for the
   starwardbound genius who had been his youths closest comrade he told
   georgina how greatness can never be exempted from the shafts of envy
   and cited the long sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar
   heels the attacks he pointed out formed the truest of all proofs of
   alfreds solid eminence

   but they hurt just the same she rejoined and all the more because
   i know that al really suffers from them no matter how indifferent he
   tries to be

   dalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among wellborn
   persons

   and it hurts me a thousand times more knowing that it hurts you and
   alf but never mind georgie well stand together and pull through
   it!

   thus it came about that georgina came more and more to rely on the
   strength of the steelfirm squarejawed governor who had been her
   youthful swain and more and more to confide in him the things she
   feared the press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all there
   were aspects of the household which she did not like surama cruel in
   equal measure to man and beast filled her with the most unnamable
   repulsion; and she could not but feel that he meant some vague
   indefinable harm to alfred she did not like the thibetans either and
   thought it very peculiar that surama was able to talk with them alfred
   would not tell her who or what surama was but had once explained
   rather haltingly that he was a much older man than would be commonly
   thought credible and that he had mastered secrets and been through
   experiences calculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for
   any scientist seeking natures hidden mysteries

   urged by her uneasiness dalton became a still more frequent visitor at
   the clarendon home though he saw that his presence was deeply resented
   by surama the bony clinicman formed the habit of glaring peculiarly
   from those spectral sockets when admitting him and would often after
   closing the gate when he left chuckle monotonously in a manner that
   made his flesh creep meanwhile dr clarendon seemed oblivious of
   everything save his work at san quentin whither he went each day in
   his launchalone save for surama who managed the wheel while the
   doctor read or collated his notes dalton welcomed these regular
   absences for they gave him constant opportunities to renew his suit
   for georginas hand when he would overstay and meet alfred however
   the latters greeting was always friendly despite his habitual reserve
   in time the engagement of james and georgina grew to be a definite
   thing and the two awaited only a favourable chance to speak to alfred

   the governor wholesouled in everything and firm in his protective
   loyalty spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friends
   behalf press and officialdom both felt his influence and he even
   succeeded in interesting scientists in the east many of whom came to
   california to study the plague and investigate the antifever bacillus
   which clarendon was so rapidly isolating and perfecting these doctors
   and biologists however did not obtain the information they wished; so
   that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression not a few
   prepared articles hostile to clarendon accusing him of an unscientific
   and fameseeking attitude and intimating that he concealed his methods
   through a highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profit

   others fortunately were more liberal in their judgments and wrote
   enthusiastically of clarendon and his work they had seen the patients
   and could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in
   leash his secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite
   justifiable since its public diffusion in unperfected form could not
   but do more harm than good clarendon himself whom many of their
   number had met before impressed them more profoundly than ever and
   they did not hesitate to compare him with jenner lister koch
   pasteur metchnikoff and the rest of those whose whole lives have
   served pathology and humanity dalton was careful to save for alfred
   all the magazines that spoke well of him bringing them in person as an
   excuse to see georgina they did not however produce much effect save
   a contemptuous smile; and clarendon would generally throw them to
   surama whose deep disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a close
   parallel to the doctors own ironic amusement

   one monday evening early in february dalton called with the definite
   intention of asking clarendon for his sisters hand georgina herself
   admitted him to the grounds and as they walked toward the house he
   stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore
   paws on his breast it was dick georginas cherished st bernard and
   dalton was glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which
   meant so much to her

   dick was excited and glad and turned the governor nearly half about
   with his vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off
   through the trees toward the clinic he did not vanish though but
   presently stopped and looked back softly barking again as if he wished
   dalton to follow georgina fond of obeying her huge pets playful
   whims motioned to james to see what he wanted; and they both walked
   slowly after him as he trotted relievedly to the rear of the yard where
   the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the stars
   above the great brick wall

   the outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark
   windowcurtains so they knew that alfred and surama were at work
   suddenly from the interior came a thin subdued sound like a cry of a
   childa plaintive call of mamma! mamma! at which dick barked while
   james and georgina started perceptibly then georgina smiled
   remembering the parrots that clarendon always kept for experimental
   uses and patted dick on the head either to forgive him for having
   fooled her and dalton or to console him for having been fooled
   himself

   as they turned slowly toward the house dalton mentioned his resolve to
   speak to alfred that evening about their engagement and georgina
   supplied no objection she knew that her brother would not relish the
   loss of a faithful manager and companion but believed his affection
   would place no barrier in the way of her happiness

   later that evening clarendon came into the house with a springy step
   and aspect less grim than usual dalton seeing a good omen in this
   easy buoyancy took heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial
   ah jimmy hows politics this year? he glanced at georgina and she
   quietly excused herself while the two men settled down to a chat on
   general subjects little by little amidst many reminders of their old
   youthful days dalton worked toward his point; till at last he came out
   plainly with the crucial query

   alf i want to marry georgina have we your blessing?

   keenly watching his old friend dalton saw a shadow steal over his
   face the dark eyes flashed for a moment then veiled themselves as
   wonted placidity returned so science or selfishness was at work after
   all!

   youre asking an impossibility james georgina isnt the aimless
   butterfly she was years ago she has a place in the service of truth
   and mankind now and that place is here shes decided to devote her
   life to my workto the household that makes my work possibleand
   theres no room for desertion or personal caprice

   dalton waited to see if he had finished the same old
   fanaticismhumanity versus the individualand the doctor was going to
   let it spoil his sisters life! then he tried to answer

   but look here alf do you mean to say that georgina in particular
   is so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr of
   her? use your sense of proportion man! if it were a question of surama
   or somebody in the utter thick of your experiments it might be
   different; but after all georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the
   last analysis she has promised to be my wife and says that she loves
   me have you the right to cut her off from the life that belongs to
   her? have you the right

   thatll do james! clarendons face was set and white whether or
   not i have the right to govern my own family is no business of an
   outsider

   outsideryou can say that to a man who dalton almost choked as the
   steely voice of the doctor interrupted him again

   an outsider to my family and from now on an outsider to my home
   dalton your presumption goes just a little too far! good evening
   governor!

   and clarendon strode from the room without extending his hand

   dalton hesitated for a moment almost at a loss what to do when
   presently georgina entered her face shewed that she had spoken with
   her brother and dalton took both her hands impetuously

   well georgie what do you say? im afraid its a choice between alf
   and me you know how i feelyou know how i felt before when it was
   your father i was up against whats your answer this time?

   he paused as she responded slowly

   james dear do you believe that i love you?

   he nodded and pressed her hands expectantly

   then if you love me youll wait a while dont think of als
   rudeness hes to be pitied i cant tell you the whole thing now but
   you know how worried i amwhat with the strain of his work the
   criticisms and the staring and cackling of that horrible creature
   surama! im afraid hell break downhe shews the strain more than
   anyone outside the family could tell i can see it for ive watched
   him all my life hes changingslowly bending under his burdensand
   he puts on his extra brusqueness to hide it you can see what i mean
   cant you dear?

   she paused and dalton nodded again pressing one of her hands to his
   breast then she concluded

   so promise me dear to be patient i must stand by him; i must! i
   must!

   dalton did not speak for a while but his head inclined in what was
   almost a bow of reverence there was more of christ in this devoted
   woman than he had thought any human being possessed; and in the face of
   such love and loyalty he could do no urging

   words of sadness and parting were brief; and james whose blue eyes
   were misty scarcely saw the gaunt clinicman as the gate to the street
   was at last opened to him but when it slammed to behind him he heard
   that bloodcurdling chuckle he had come to recognise so well and knew
   that surama was theresurama whom georgina had called her brothers
   evil genius walking away with a firm step dalton resolved to be
   watchful and to act at the first sign of trouble

   iii

   meanwhile san francisco the epidemic still on the lips of all seethed
   with anticlarendon feeling actually the cases outside the
   penitentiary were very few and confined almost wholly to the lower
   mexican element whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitation to
   disease of every kind; but politicians and the people needed no more
   than this to confirm the attacks made by the doctors enemies seeing
   that dalton was immovable in his championship of clarendon the
   malcontents medical dogmatists and wardheelers turned their
   attention to the state legislature; lining up the anticlarendonists
   and the governors old enemies with great shrewdness and preparing to
   launch a lawwith a vetoproof majoritytransferring the authority
   for minor institutional appointments from the chief executive to the
   various boards or commissions concerned

   in the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than
   clarendons chief assistant dr jones jealous of his superior from
   the first he now saw an opportunity for turning matters to his liking;
   and he thanked fate for the circumstanceresponsible indeed for his
   present positionof his relationship to the chairman of the prison
   board the new law if passed would certainly mean the removal of
   clarendon and the appointment of himself in his stead; so mindful of
   his own interest he worked hard for it jones was all that clarendon
   was nota natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served
   his own advancement first and science only incidentally he was poor
   and avid for salaried position quite in contrast to the wealthy and
   independent savant he sought to displace so with a ratlike cunning
   and persistence he laboured to undermine the great biologist above him
   and was one day rewarded by the news that the new law was passed
   thenceforward the governor was powerless to make appointments to the
   state institutions and the medical directorship of san quentin lay at
   the disposal of the prison board

   of all this legislative turmoil clarendon was singularly oblivious
   wrapped wholly in matters of administration and research he was blind
   to the treason of that ass jones who worked by his side and deaf to
   all the gossip of the wardens office he had never in his life read
   the newspapers and the banishment of dalton from his house cut off his
   last real link with the world of outside events with the naiveté of a
   recluse he at no time thought of his position as insecure in view of
   daltons loyalty and of his forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs
   as shewn in his dealings with the elder clarendon who had crushed his
   father to death on the stock exchange the possibility of a
   gubernatorial dismissal was of course out of the question; nor could
   the doctors political ignorance envisage a sudden shift of power which
   might place the matter of retention or dismissal in very different
   hands thereupon he merely smiled with satisfaction when dalton left
   for sacramento; convinced that his place in san quentin and his
   sisters place in his household were alike secure from disturbance he
   was accustomed to having what he wanted and fancied his luck was still
   holding out

   the first week in march a day or so after the enactment of the new
   law the chairman of the prison board called at san quentin clarendon
   was out but dr jones was glad to shew the august visitorhis own
   uncle incidentallythrough the great infirmary including the fever
   ward made so famous by press and panic by this time converted against
   his will to clarendons belief in the fevers noncontagiousness jones
   smilingly assured his uncle that nothing was to be feared and
   encouraged him to inspect the patients in detailespecially a ghastly
   skeleton once a very giant of bulk and vigour who was he insinuated
   slowly and painfully dying because clarendon would not administer the
   proper medicine

   do you mean to say cried the chairman that dr clarendon refuses
   to let the man have what he needs knowing his life could be saved?
   just that snapped dr jones pausing as the door opened to admit
   none other than clarendon himself clarendon nodded coldly to jones and
   surveyed the visitor whom he did not know with disapproval

   dr jones i thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at
   all and havent i said that visitors arent to be admitted except by
   special permission?

   but the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce him

   pardon me dr clarendon but am i to understand that you refuse to
   give this man the medicine that would save him? clarendon glared
   coldly and rejoined with steel in his voice

   thats an impertinent question sir i am in authority here and
   visitors are not allowed please leave the room at once

   the chairman his sense of drama secretly tickled answered with
   greater pomp and hauteur than were necessary

   you mistake me sir! i not you am master here you are addressing
   the chairman of the prison board i must say moreover that i deem
   your activity a menace to the welfare of the prisoners and must
   request your resignation henceforth dr jones will be in charge and
   if you wish to remain until your formal dismissal you will take your
   orders from him

   it was wilfred joness great moment life never gave him another such
   climax and we need not grudge him this one after all he was a small
   rather than a bad man and he had only obeyed a small mans code of
   looking to himself at all costs clarendon stood still gazing at the
   speaker as if he thought him mad till in another second the look of
   triumph on dr joness face convinced him that something important was
   indeed afoot he was icily courteous as he replied

   no doubt you are what you claim to be sir but fortunately my
   appointment came from the governor of the state and can therefore be
   revoked only by him

   the chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly for they had not
   realised to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go then the older
   man grasping the situation explained at some length

   had i found that the current reports did you an injustice he
   concluded i would have deferred action; but the case of this poor man
   and your own arrogant manner left me no choice as it is

   but dr clarendon interrupted with a new razorsharpness in his voice

   as it is i am the director in charge at present and i ask you to
   leave this room at once

   the chairman reddened and exploded

   look here sir who do you think youre talking to? ill have you
   chucked out of heredamn your impertinence!

   but he had time only to finish the sentence transformed by the insult
   to a sudden dynamo of hate the slender scientist launched out with
   both fists in a burst of preternatural strength of which no one would
   have thought him capable and if his strength was preternatural his
   accuracy of aim was no less so; for not even a champion of the ring
   could have wrought a neater result both menthe chairman and dr
   joneswere squarely hit; the one full in the face and the other on the
   point of the chin going down like felled trees they lay motionless
   and unconscious on the floor; while clarendon now clear and completely
   master of himself took his hat and cane and went out to join surama in
   the launch only when seated in the moving boat did he at last give
   audible vent to the frightful rage that consumed him then with face
   convulsed he called down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs
   beyond the stars; so that even surama shuddered made an elder sign
   that no book of history records and forgot to chuckle

   iv

   georgina soothed her brothers hurt as best she could he had come home
   mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library
   lounge; and in that gloomy room little by little the faithful sister
   had taken in the almost incredible news her consolations were
   instantaneous and tender and she made him realise how vast though
   unconscious a tribute to his greatness the attacks persecution and
   dismissal all were he had tried to cultivate the indifference she
   preached and could have done so had personal dignity alone been
   involved but the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could
   calmly bear and he sighed again and again as he repeated how three
   months more of study in the prison might have given him at last the
   longsought bacillus which would make all fever a thing of the past

   then georgina tried another mode of cheering and told him that surely
   the prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate
   or if it broke out with increased force but even this was ineffective
   and clarendon answered only in a string of bitter ironic and
   halfmeaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how
   deeply despair and resentment had bitten

   abate? break out again? oh itll abate all right! at least theyll
   think it has abated theyd think anything no matter what happens!
   ignorant eyes see nothing and bunglers are never discoverers science
   never shews her face to that sort and they call themselves doctors!
   best of all fancy that ass jones in charge!

   ceasing with a quick sneer he laughed so daemoniacally that georgina
   shivered

   the days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the clarendon mansion
   depression stark and unrelieved had taken hold of the doctors
   usually tireless mind; and he would even have refused food had not
   georgina forced it upon him his great notebook of observations lay
   unopened on the library table and his little gold syringe of
   antifever seruma clever device of his own with a selfcontained
   reservoir attached to a broad gold finger ring and singlepressure
   action peculiar to itselfrested idly in a small leather case beside
   it vigour ambition and the desire for study and observation seemed
   to have died within him; and he made no inquiries about his clinic
   where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderly phials awaiting
   his attention

   the countless animals held for experiments played lively and well fed
   in the early spring sunshine; and as georgina strolled out through the
   rosearbour to the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of
   happiness about her she knew though how tragically transient that
   happiness must be; since the start of new work would soon make all
   these small creatures unwilling martyrs to science knowing this she
   glimpsed a sort of compensating element in her brothers inaction and
   encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly the eight
   thibetan servants moved noiselessly about each as impeccably effective
   as usual; and georgina saw to it that the order of the household did
   not suffer because of the masters relaxation

   study and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressinggowned
   indifference clarendon was content to let georgina treat him as an
   infant he met her maternal fussiness with a slow sad smile and
   always obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts a kind of faint
   wistful felicity came over the languid household amidst which the only
   dissenting note was supplied by surama he indeed was miserable and
   looked often with sullen and resentful eyes at the sunny serenity in
   georginas face his only joy had been the turmoil of experiment and
   he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals bearing them to the
   clinic in clutching talons and watching them with hot brooding gaze
   and evil chuckles as they gradually fell into the final coma with
   wideopened redrimmed eyes and swollen tongue lolling from
   frothcovered mouth

   now he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree
   creatures in their cages and frequently came to ask clarendon if there
   were any orders finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin
   work he would go away muttering under his breath and glaring curses
   upon everything; stealing with catlike tread to his own quarters in
   the basement where his voice would sometimes ascend in deep muffled
   rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortably ritualistic
   suggestion

   all this wore on georginas nerves but not by any means so gravely as
   her brothers continued lassitude itself the duration of the state
   alarmed her and little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness
   which had so provoked the clinicman herself skilled in medicine she
   found the doctors condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienists
   point of view; and she now feared as much from his absence of interest
   and activity as she had formerly feared from his fanatical zeal and
   overstudy was lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant
   man of intellect into an innocuous imbecile?

   then toward the end of may came the sudden change georgina always
   recalled the smallest details connected with it; details as trivial as
   the box delivered to surama the day before postmarked algiers and
   emitting a most unpleasant odour; and the sharp sudden thunderstorm
   rare in the extreme for california which sprang up that night as
   surama chanted his rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning
   chestvoice louder and more intense than usual

   it was a sunny day and she had been in the garden gathering flowers
   for the diningroom reentering the house she glimpsed her brother in
   the library fully dressed and seated at the table alternately
   consulting the notes in his thick observation book and making fresh
   entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen he was alert and vital
   and there was a satisfying resilience about his movements as he now and
   then turned a page or reached for a book from the rear of the great
   table delighted and relieved georgina hastened to deposit her flowers
   in the diningroom and return; but when she reached the library again
   she found that her brother was gone

   she knew of course that he must be in the clinic at work and
   rejoiced to think that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into
   place realising it would be of no use to delay the luncheon for him
   she ate alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in case of his
   return at an odd moment but he did not come he was making up for lost
   time and was still in the great stoutplanked clinic when she went for
   a stroll through the rosearbour

   as she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw surama fetching
   animals for the test she wished she could notice him less for he
   always made her shudder; but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and
   ears where he was concerned he always went hatless around the yard
   and the total hairlessness of his head enhanced his skeletonlike
   aspect horribly now she heard a faint chuckle as he took a small
   monkey from its cage against the wall and carried it to the clinic his
   long bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it
   cried out in frightened anguish the sight sickened her and brought
   her walk to an end her inmost soul rebelled at the ascendancy this
   creature had gained over her brother and she reflected bitterly that
   the two had almost changed places as master and servant

   night came without clarendons return to the house and georgina
   concluded that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions
   which meant total disregard of time she hated to retire without a talk
   with him about his sudden recovery; but finally feeling it would be
   futile to wait up she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his
   chair on the library table; then started resolutely for bed she was
   not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut so it had
   not been an allnight session after all! determined to see that her
   brother had a meal before retiring she rose slipped on a robe and
   descended to the library halting only when she heard voices from
   behind the halfopened door clarendon and surama were talking and she
   waited till the clinicman might go

   surama however shewed no inclination to depart; and indeed the whole
   heated tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise
   length georgina though she had not meant to listen could not help
   catching a phrase now and then and presently became aware of a
   sinister undercurrent which frightened her very much without being
   wholly clear to her her brothers voice nervous incisive held her
   notice with disquieting persistence

   but anyway he was saying we havent enough animals for another
   day and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short
   notice it seems silly to waste so much effort on comparative trash
   when human specimens could be had with just a little extra care
   georgina sickened at the possible implication and caught at the hall
   rack to steady herself surama was replying in that deep hollow tone
   which seemed to echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand
   planets

   steady steadywhat a child you are with your haste and impatience!
   you crowd things so! when youve lived as i have so that a whole life
   will seem only an hour you wont be so fretful about a day or week or
   month! you work too fast youve plenty of specimens in the cages for a
   full week if youll only go at a sensible rate you might even begin on
   the older material if youd be sure not to overdo it never mind my
   haste! the reply was snapped out sharply; i have my own methods i
   dont want to use our material if i can help it for i prefer them as
   they are and youd better be careful of them anywayyou know the
   knives those sly dogs carry suramas deep chuckle came

   dont worry about that the brutes eat dont they? well i can get
   you one any time you need it but go slowwith the boy gone there are
   only eight and now that youve lost san quentin itll be hard to get
   new ones by the wholesale id advise you to start in on tsanpohes
   the least use to you as he is and

   but that was all georgina heard transfixed by a hideous dread from the
   thoughts this talk excited she nearly sank to the floor where she
   stood and was scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her
   room what was the evil monster surama planning? into what was he
   guiding her brother? what monstrous circumstances lay behind these
   cryptic sentences? a thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced
   before her eyes and she flung herself upon the bed without hope of
   sleep one thought above the rest stood out with fiendish prominence
   and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her brain with
   renewed force then nature kinder than she expected intervened at
   last closing her eyes in a dead faint she did not awake till morning
   nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the
   overheard words had brought

   with the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension what happens
   in the night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in
   distorted forms and georgina could see that her brain must have given
   strange colour to scraps of common medical conversation to suppose her
   brotheronly son of the gentle frances schuyler clarendonguilty of
   savage sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to
   their blood and she decided to omit all mention of her trip
   downstairs lest alfred ridicule her fantastic notions when she
   reached the breakfast table she found that clarendon was already gone
   and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance
   to congratulate him on his revived activity quietly taking the
   breakfast served by stonedeaf old margarita the mexican cook she
   read the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the
   sittingroom window overlooking the great yard all was silent out
   there and she could see that the last of the animal cages had been
   emptied science was served and the limepit held all that was left of
   the once pretty and lively little creatures this slaughter had always
   grieved her but she had never complained since she knew it was all
   for humanity being a scientists sister she used to say to herself
   was like being the sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen
   from their foes

   after luncheon georgina resumed her post by the window and had been
   busily sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the
   yard caused her to look out in alarm there not far from the clinic
   she saw the ghastly form of surama a revolver in his hand and his
   skullface twisted into a strange expression as he chuckled at a
   cowering figure robed in black silk and carrying a long thibetan knife
   it was the servant tsanpo and as she recognised the shrivelled face
   georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the night before
   the sun flashed on the polished blade and suddenly suramas revolver
   spat once more this time the knife flew from the mongols hand and
   surama glanced greedily at his shaking and bewildered prey

   then tsanpo glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen
   knife sprang nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinicman
   and made a dash for the house surama however was too swift for him
   and caught him in a single leap seizing his shoulder and almost
   crushing him for a moment the thibetan tried to struggle but surama
   lifted him like an animal by the scruff of the neck and bore him off
   toward the clinic georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the man in
   his own tongue and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver
   with fright suddenly realising against her own will what was taking
   place a great horror mastered her and she fainted for the second time
   within twentyfour hours

   when consciousness returned the golden light of late afternoon was
   flooding the room georgina picking up her fallen workbasket and
   scattered materials was lost in a daze of doubt; but finally felt
   convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have been all too
   tragically real her worst fears then were horrible truths what to
   do about it nothing in her experience could tell her; and she was
   vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear she must talk to him
   but not now she could not talk to anybody now and thinking
   shudderingly of the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic
   windows she crept into bed for a long night of anguished
   sleeplessness

   rising haggardly on the following day georgina saw the doctor for the
   first time since his recovery he was bustling about preoccupiedly
   circulating between the house and the clinic and paying little
   attention to anything besides his work there was no chance for the
   dreaded interview and clarendon did not even notice his sisters
   wornout aspect and hesitant manner

   in the evening she heard him in the library talking to himself in a
   fashion most unusual for him and she felt that he was under a great
   strain which might culminate in the return of his apathy entering the
   room she tried to calm him without referring to any trying subject
   and forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him finally she asked
   gently what was distressing him and waited anxiously for his reply
   hoping to hear that suramas treatment of the poor thibetan had
   horrified and outraged him

   there was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he responded

   whats distressing me? good god georgina what isnt? look at the
   cages and see if you have to ask again! cleaned outmilked drynot a
   cursed specimen left; and a line of the most important bacterial
   cultures incubating in their tubes without a chance to do an ounce of
   good! days work wastedwhole programme set backits enough to drive
   a man mad! how shall i ever get anywhere if i cant scrape up some
   decent subjects?

   georgina stroked his forehead

   i think you ought to rest a while al dear

   he moved away

   rest? thats good! thats damn good! what else have i been doing but
   resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last
   fifty or a hundred or a thousand years? just as i manage to shake off
   the clouds i have to run short of materialand then im told to lapse
   back again into drooling stupefaction! god! and all the while some
   sneaking thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to
   come out ahead of me with the credit for my own work ill lose by a
   necksome fool with the proper specimens will get the prize when one
   week more with even halfadequate facilities would see me through with
   flying colours!

   his voice rose querulously and there was an overtone of mental strain
   which georgina did not like she answered softly yet not so softly as
   to hint at the soothing of a psychopathic case

   but youre killing yourself with this worry and tension and if youre
   dead how can you do your work?

   he gave a smile that was almost a sneer

   i guess a week or a monthall the time i needwouldnt quite finish
   me and it doesnt much matter what becomes of me or any other
   individual in the end science is what must be servedsciencethe
   austere cause of human knowledge im like the monkeys and birds and
   guineapigs i usejust a cog in the machine to be used to the
   advantage of the whole they had to be killedi may have to be
   killedwhat of it? isnt the cause we serve worth that and more?

   georgina sighed for a moment she wondered whether after all this
   ceaseless round of slaughter really was worth while

   but are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to
   humanity to warrant these sacrifices?

   clarendons eyes flashed dangerously

   humanity! what the deuce is humanity? science! dolts! just individuals
   over and over again! humanity is made for preachers to whom it means
   the blindly credulous humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom
   it speaks in terms of dollars and cents humanity is made for the
   politician to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his
   advantage what is humanity? nothing! thank god that crude illusion
   doesnt last! what a grown man worships is
   truthknowledgesciencelightthe rending of the veil and the
   pushing back of the shadow knowledge the juggernaut! there is death
   in our own ritual we must killdissectdestroyand all for the sake
   of discoverythe worship of the ineffable light the goddess science
   demands it we test a doubtful poison by killing how else? no thought
   for selfjust knowledgethe effect must be known

   his voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion and georgina
   shuddered slightly

   but this is horrible al! you shouldnt think of it that way!

   clarendon cackled sardonically in a manner which stirred odd and
   repugnant associations in his sisters mind

   horrible? you think what i say is horrible? you ought to hear surama!
   i tell you things were known to the priests of atlantis that would
   have you drop dead of fright if you heard a hint of them knowledge was
   knowledge a hundred thousand years ago when our especial forbears were
   shambling about asia as speechless semiapes! they know something of it
   in the hoggar regionthere are rumours in the farther uplands of
   thibetand once i heard an old man in china calling on yogsothoth

   he turned pale and made a curious sign in the air with his extended
   forefinger georgina felt genuinely alarmed but became somewhat calmer
   as his speech took a less fantastic form

   yes it may be horrible but its glorious too the pursuit of
   knowledge i mean certainly theres no slovenly sentiment connected
   with it doesnt nature killconstantly and remorselesslyand are any
   but fools horrified at the struggle? killings are necessary they are
   the glory of science we learn something from them and we cant
   sacrifice learning to sentiment hear the sentimentalists howl against
   vaccination! they fear it will kill the child well what if it does?
   how else can we discover the laws of disease concerned? as a
   scientists sister you ought to know better than to prate sentiment
   you ought to help my work instead of hindering it!

   but al protested georgina i havent the slightest intention of
   hindering your work havent i always tried to help as much as i could?
   i am ignorant i suppose and cant help very actively; but at least
   im proud of youproud for my own sake and for the familys sakeand
   ive always tried to smooth the way youve given me credit for that
   many a time

   clarendon looked at her keenly

   yes he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room youre
   right youve always tried to help as best you knew you may yet have a
   chance to help still more

   georgina seeing him disappear through the front door followed him
   into the yard some distance away a lantern was shining through the
   trees and as they approached it they saw surama bending over a large
   object stretched on the ground clarendon advancing gave a short
   grunt; but when georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek
   it was dick the great st bernard and he was lying still with
   reddened eyes and protruding tongue

   hes sick al! she cried do something for him quick!

   the doctor looked at surama who had uttered something in a tongue
   unknown to georgina

   take him to the clinic he ordered; im afraid dicks caught the
   fever

   surama took up the dog as he had taken poor tsanpo the day before and
   carried him silently to the building near the wall he did not chuckle
   this time but glanced at clarendon with what appeared to be real
   anxiety it almost seemed to georgina that surama was asking the doctor
   to save her pet

   clarendon however made no move to follow but stood still for a
   moment and then sauntered slowly toward the house georgina astonished
   at such callousness kept up a running fire of entreaties on dicks
   behalf but it was of no use without paying the slightest attention to
   her pleas he made directly for the library and began to read in a large
   old book which had lain face down on the table she put her hand on his
   shoulder as he sat there but he did not speak or turn his head he
   only kept on reading and georgina glancing curiously over his
   shoulder wondered in what strange alphabet this brassbound tome was
   written

   in the cavernous parlour across the hall sitting alone in the dark a
   quarter of an hour later georgina came to her decision something was
   gravely wrongjust what and to what extent she scarcely dared
   formulate to herselfand it was time that she called in some stronger
   force to help her of course it must be james he was powerful and
   capable and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing
   to do he had known al always and would understand

   it was by this time rather late but georgina had resolved on action
   across the hall the light still shone from the library and she looked
   wistfully at the doorway as she quietly donned a hat and left the
   house outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds it was only a
   short walk to jackson street where by good luck she found a carriage
   to take her to the western union telegraph office there she carefully
   wrote out a message to james dalton in sacramento asking him to come
   at once to san francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them
   all

   v

   dalton was frankly perplexed by georginas sudden message he had had
   no word from the clarendons since that stormy february evening when
   alfred had declared him an outsider to his home; and he in turn had
   studiously refrained from communicating even when he had longed to
   express sympathy after the doctors summary ousting from office he had
   fought hard to frustrate the politicians and keep the appointive power
   and was bitterly sorry to watch the unseating of a man who despite
   recent estrangements still represented to him the ultimate ideal of
   scientific competence

   now with this clearly frightened summons before him he could not
   imagine what had happened he knew though that georgina was not one
   to lose her head or send forth a needless alarm; hence he wasted no
   time but took the overland which left sacramento within the hour
   going at once to his club and sending word to georgina by a messenger
   that he was in town and wholly at her service meanwhile things had
   been quiescent at the clarendon home notwithstanding the doctors
   continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dogs
   condition shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening but for
   the moment there was a lull georgina was relieved to get daltons
   message and learn that he was close at hand and sent back word that
   she would call him when necessity arose amidst all the gathering
   tension some faint compensating element seemed manifest and georgina
   finally decided that it was the absence of the lean thibetans whose
   stealthy sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect had always annoyed
   her they had vanished all at once; and old margarita the sole visible
   servant left in the house told her they were helping their master and
   surama at the clinic the following morningthe twentyeighth of
   maylong to be rememberedwas dark and lowering and georgina felt
   the precarious calm wearing thin she did not see her brother at all
   but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at something despite the
   lack of specimens he had bewailed she wondered how poor tsanpo was
   getting along and whether he had really been subjected to any serious
   inoculation but it must be confessed that she wondered more about
   dick she longed to know whether surama had done anything for the
   faithful dog amidst his masters oddly callous indifference suramas
   apparent solicitude on the night of dicks seizure had impressed her
   greatly giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she had ever had for
   the detested clinicman now as the day advanced she found herself
   thinking more and more of dick; till at last her harassed nerves
   finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the whole
   horror that lay upon the household could stand the suspense no longer

   up to that time she had always respected alfreds imperious wish that
   he be never approached or disturbed at the clinic; but as this fateful
   afternoon advanced her resolution to break through the barrier grew
   stronger and stronger finally she set out with determined face
   crossing the yard and entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden
   structure with the fixed intention of discovering how the dog was or of
   knowing the reason for her brothers secrecy

   the inner door as usual was locked; and behind it she heard voices in
   heated conversation when her knocking brought no response she rattled
   the knob as loudly as possible but still the voices argued on
   unheeding they belonged of course to surama and her brother; and as
   she stood there trying to attract attention she could not help catch
   something of their drift fate had made her for the second time an
   eavesdropper and once more the matter she overheard seemed likely to
   tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds
   alfred and surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence
   and the purport of their speech was enough to arouse the wildest fears
   and confirm the gravest apprehensions georgina shivered as her
   brothers voice mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical
   tension

   you damn youyoure a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me!
   who started all this anyway? did i have any idea of your cursed
   devilgods and elder world? did i ever in my life think of your damned
   spaces beyond the stars and your crawling chaos nyarlathotep? i was a
   normal scientific man confound you till i was fool enough to drag you
   out of the vaults with your devilish atlantean secrets you egged me
   on and now you want to cut me off! you loaf around doing nothing and
   telling me to go slow when you might just as well as not be going out
   and getting material you know damn well that i dont know how to go
   about such things whereas you must have been an old hand at it before
   the earth was made its like you you damned walking corpse to start
   something you wont or cant finish! suramas evil chuckle came

   youre insane clarendon thats the only reason i let you rave on
   when i could send you to hell in three minutes enough is enough and
   youve certainly had enough material for any novice at your stage
   youve had all im going to get you anyhow! youre only a maniac on
   the subject nowwhat a cheap crazy thing to sacrifice even your poor
   sisters pet dog when you could have spared him as well as not! you
   cant look at any living thing now without wanting to jab that gold
   syringe into it nodick had to go where the mexican boy wentwhere
   tsanpo and the other seven wentwhere all the animals went! what a
   pupil! youre no fun anymoreyouve lost your nerve you set out to
   control things and theyre controlling you im about done with you
   clarendon i thought you had the stuff in you but you havent its
   about time i tried somebody else im afraid youll have to go!

   in the doctors shouted reply there was both fear and frenzy

   be careful you ! there are powers against your powersi didnt
   go to china for nothing and there are things in alhazreds azif which
   werent known in atlantis! weve both meddled in dangerous things but
   you neednt think you know all my resources how about the nemesis of
   flame? i talked in yemen with an old man who had come back alive from
   the crimson deserthe had seen irem the city of pillars and had
   worshipped at the underground shrines of nug and yebiÄ!
   shubniggurath!

   through clarendons shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the
   clinicman

   shut up you fool! do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any
   weight with me? words and formulaewords and formulaewhat do they
   all mean to one who has the substance behind them? were in a material
   sphere now and subject to material laws you have your fever; i have
   my revolver youll get no specimens and ill get no fever so long as
   i have you in front of me with this gun between!

   that was all georgina could hear she felt her senses reeling and
   staggered out of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering
   outside air she saw that the crisis had come at last and that help
   must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be saved from the unknown
   gulfs of madness and mystery summoning up all her reserve energy she
   managed to reach the house and get to the library where she scrawled a
   hasty note for margarita to take to james dalton

   when the old woman had gone georgina had just strength enough to cross
   to the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semistupor there
   she lay for what seemed like years conscious only of the fantastic
   creeping up of the twilight from the lower corners of the great dismal
   room and plagued by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed
   with phantasmal halflimned pageantry through her tortured and stifled
   brain dusk deepened into darkness and still the spell held then a
   firm tread sounded in the hall and she heard someone enter the room
   and fumble at the matchsafe her heart almost stopped beating as the
   gasjets of the chandelier flared up one by one but then she saw that
   the arrival was her brother relieved to the bottom of her heart that
   he was still alive she gave vent to an involuntary sigh profound
   longdrawn and tremulous and lapsed at last into kindly oblivion

   at the sound of that sigh clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge
   and was inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of
   his sister there her face had a deathlike quality that frightened his
   inmost spirit and he flung himself on his knees by her side awake to
   a realisation of what her passing away would mean to him long unused
   to private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth he had lost
   the physicians instinct of first aid and could only call out her name
   and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him then
   he thought of water and ran to the diningroom for a carafe stumbling
   about in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors he was some
   time in finding what he sought; but at last he clutched it in shaking
   hand and hastened back to dash the cold fluid in georginas face the
   method was crude but effective she stirred sighed a second time and
   finally opened her eyes

   you are alive! he cried and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his
   head maternally she was almost glad she fainted for the circumstance
   seemed to have dispelled the strange alfred and brought her own brother
   back to her she sat up slowly and tried to reassure him

   im all right al just give me a glass of water its a sin to waste
   it this wayto say nothing of spoiling my waist! is that the way to
   behave every time your sister drops off for a nap? you neednt think
   im going to be sick for i havent time for such nonsense! alfreds
   eyes shewed that her cool commonsense speech had had its effect his
   brotherly panic dissolved in an instant and instead there came into
   his face a vague calculating expression as if some marvellous
   possibility had just dawned upon him as she watched the subtle waves
   of cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she
   became less and less certain that her mode of reassurance had been a
   wise one and before he spoke she found herself shivering at something
   she could not define a keen medical instinct almost told her that his
   moment of sanity had passed and that he was now once more the
   unrestrained fanatic for scientific research there was something
   morbid in the quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mention of good
   health what was he thinking? to what unnatural extreme was his passion
   for experiment about to be pushed? wherein lay the special significance
   of her pure blood and absolutely flawless organic state? none of these
   misgivings however troubled georgina for more than a second and she
   was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her brothers steady
   fingers at her pulse

   youre a bit feverish georgie he said in a precise elaborately
   restrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyes why
   nonsense im all right she replied one would think you were on the
   watch for fever patients just for the sake of shewing off your
   discovery! it would be poetic though if you could make your final
   proof and demonstration by curing your own sister! clarendon started
   violently and guiltily had she suspected his wish? had he muttered
   anything aloud? he looked at her closely and saw that she had no
   inkling of the truth she smiled up sweetly into his face and patted
   his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge then he took a small
   oblong leather case from his vest pocket and taking out a little gold
   syringe he began fingering it thoughtfully pushing the piston
   speculatively in and out of the empty cylinder

   i wonder he began with suave sententiousness whether you would
   really be willing to help science insomething like that wayif the
   need arose? whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to
   the cause of medicine as a sort of jephthahs daughter if you knew it
   meant the absolute perfection and completion of my work?

   georgina catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brothers
   eyes knew at last that her worst fears were true there was nothing to
   do now but keep him quiet at all hazards and to pray that margarita had
   found james dalton at his club

   you look tired al dear she said gently why not take a little
   morphia and get some of the sleep you need so badly?

   he replied with a kind of crafty deliberation

   yes youre right im worn out and so are you each of us needs a
   good sleep morphine is just the thingwait till i go and fill the
   syringe and well both take a proper dose

   still fingering the empty syringe he walked softly out of the room
   georgina looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation ears
   alert for any sign of possible help she thought she heard margarita
   again in the basement kitchen and rose to ring the bell in an effort
   to learn of the fate of her message the old servant answered her
   summons at once and declared she had given the message at the club
   hours ago governor dalton had been out but the clerk had promised to
   deliver the note at the very moment of his arrival margarita waddled
   below stairs again but still clarendon did not reappear what was he
   doing? what was he planning? she had heard the outer door slam so knew
   he must be at the clinic had he forgotten his original intention with
   the vacillating mind of madness? the suspense grew almost unbearable
   and georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid screaming

   it was the gate bell which rang simultaneously in house and clinic
   that broke the tension at last she heard the catlike tread of surama
   on the walk as he left the clinic to answer it; and then with an
   almost hysterical sigh of relief she caught the firm familiar accents
   of dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant rising she
   almost tottered to meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway; and
   for a moment no word was spoken while he kissed her hand in his
   courtly oldschool fashion then georgina burst forth into a torrent
   of hurried explanation telling all that had happened all she had
   glimpsed and overheard and all she feared and suspected dalton
   listened gravely and comprehendingly his first bewilderment gradually
   giving place to astonishment sympathy and resolution the message
   held by a careless clerk had been slightly delayed and had found him
   appropriately enough in the midst of a warm loungingroom discussion
   about clarendon a fellowmember dr macneil had brought in a medical
   journal with an article well calculated to disturb the devoted
   scientist and dalton had just asked to keep the paper for future
   reference when the message was handed him at last abandoning his
   halfformed plan to take dr macneil into his confidence regarding
   alfred he called at once for his hat and stick and lost not a moment
   in getting a cab for the clarendon home

   surama he thought appeared alarmed at recognising him; though he had
   chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic dalton
   always recalled suramas stride and chuckle on this ominous night for
   he was never to see the unearthly creature again as the chuckler
   entered the clinic vestibule his deep guttural gurgles seemed to blend
   with some low mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizon

   when dalton had heard all georgina had to say and learned that alfred
   was expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine he
   decided he had better talk with the doctor alone advising georgina to
   retire to her room and await developments he walked about the gloomy
   library scanning the shelves and listening for clarendons nervous
   footstep on the clinic path outside the vast rooms corners were
   dismal despite the chandelier and the closer dalton looked at his
   friends choice of books the less he liked them it was not the
   balanced collection of a normal physician biologist or man of general
   culture there were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes;
   dark speculations and forbidden rituals of the middle ages and strange
   exotic mysteries in alien alphabets both known and unknown

   the great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome too
   the handwriting had a neurotic cast and the spirit of the entries was
   far from reassuring long passages were inscribed in crabbed greek
   characters and as dalton marshalled his linguistic memory for their
   translation he gave a sudden start and wished his college struggles
   with xenophon and homer had been more conscientious there was
   something wrongsomething hideously wronghere and the governor sank
   limply into the chair by the table as he pored more and more closely
   over the doctors barbarous greek then a sound came startlingly near
   and he jumped nervously at a hand laid sharply on his shoulder

   what may i ask is the cause of this intrusion? you might have stated
   your business to surama

   clarendon was standing icily by the chair the little gold syringe in
   one hand he seemed very calm and rational and dalton fancied for a
   moment that georgina must have exaggerated his condition how too
   could a rusty scholar be absolutely sure about these greek entries? the
   governor decided to be very cautious in his interview and thanked the
   lucky chance which had placed a specious pretext in his coat pocket he
   was very cool and assured as he rose to reply

   i didnt think youd care to have things dragged before a subordinate
   but i thought you ought to see this article at once

   he drew forth the magazine given him by dr macneil and handed it to
   clarendon

   on page 542you see the heading `black fever conquered by new serum
   its by dr miller of philadelphiaand he thinks hes got ahead of you
   with your cure they were discussing it at the club and macneil
   thought the exposition very convincing i as a layman couldnt
   pretend to judge; but at all events i thought you oughtnt to miss a
   chance to digest the thing while its fresh if youre busy of course
   i wont disturb you

   clarendon cut in sharply

   im going to give my sister an hypodermicshes not quite wellbut
   ill look at what that quack has to say when i get back i know
   millera damn sneak and incompetentand i dont believe he has the
   brains to steal my methods from the little hes seen of them dalton
   suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that georgina must not
   receive that intended dose there was something sinister about it from
   what she had said alfred must have been inordinately long preparing
   it far longer than was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet
   he decided to hold his host as long as possible meanwhile testing his
   attitude in a more or less subtle way im sorry georgina isnt well
   are you sure that the injection will do her good? that it wont do her
   any harm? clarendons spasmodic start shewed that something had been
   struck home

   do her harm? he cried dont be absurd! you know georgina must be in
   the best of healththe very best i sayin order to serve science as
   a clarendon should serve it she at least appreciates the fact that
   she is my sister she deems no sacrifice too great in my service she
   is a priestess of truth and discovery as i am a priest

   he paused in his shrill tirade wildeyed and somewhat out of breath
   dalton could see that his attention had been momentarily shifted but
   let me see what this cursed quack has to say he continued if he
   thinks his pseudomedical rhetoric can take a real doctor in he is
   even simpler than i thought!

   clarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood
   there clutching his syringe dalton wondered what the real facts were
   macneil had assured him that the author was a pathologist of the
   highest standing and that whatever errors the article might have the
   mind behind it was powerful erudite and absolutely honourable and
   sincere

   watching the doctor as he read dalton saw the thin bearded face grow
   pale the great eyes blazed and the pages crackled in the tenser grip
   of the long lean fingers a perspiration broke out on the high
   ivorywhite forehead where the hair was already thinning and the
   reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept
   on with his devouring of the text then came a wild scream as from a
   haunted beast and clarendon lurched forward on the table his outflung
   arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousness went dark
   like a windquenched candleflame

   dalton springing to help his stricken friend raised the slim form and
   tilted it back in the chair seeing the carafe on the floor near the
   lounge he dashed some water into the twisted face and was rewarded by
   seeing the large eyes slowly open they were sane eyes nowdeep and
   sad and unmistakably saneand dalton felt awed in the presence of a
   tragedy whose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumb

   the golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand and as
   clarendon drew a deep shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and
   studied the glittering thing that rolled about on his palm then he
   spokeslowly and with the ineffable sadness of utter absolute
   despair

   thanks jimmy im quite all right but theres much to be done you
   asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do georgie any
   harm im in a position now to tell you that it wont

   he turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston
   at the same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own
   neck dalton cried out in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand
   injected the contents of the cylinder into the ridge of distended
   flesh

   good lord al what have you done?

   clarendon smiled gentlya smile almost of peace and resignation
   different indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeks you
   ought to know jimmy if youve still the judgment that made you a
   governor you must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise
   that theres nothing else to do with your marks in greek back at
   columbia i guess you couldnt have missed much all i can say is that
   its true

   james i dont like to pass blame along but its only right to tell
   you that surama got me into this i cant tell you who or what he is
   for i dont fully know myself and what i do know is stuff that no sane
   person ought to know; but i will say that i dont consider him a human
   being in the fullest sense and that im not sure whether or not hes
   alive as we know life

   you think im talking nonsense i wish i were but the whole hideous
   mess is damnably real i started out in life with a clean mind and
   purpose i wanted to rid the world of fever i tried and failedand i
   wish to god i had been honest enough to say that id failed dont let
   my old talk of science deceive you jamesi found no antitoxin and was
   never even half on the track of one!

   dont look so shaken up old fellow! a veteran politicianfighter like
   you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before i tell you i never had
   even the start of a fever cure but my studies had taken me into some
   queer places and it was just my damned luck to listen to the stories
   of some still queerer people james if you ever wish any man well
   tell him to keep clear of the ancient hidden places of the earth old
   backwaters are dangerousthings are handed down there that dont do
   healthy people any good i talked too much with old priests and
   mystics and got to hoping i might achieve things in dark ways that i
   couldnt achieve in lawful ways

   i shant tell you just what i mean for if i did id be as bad as the
   old priests that were the ruin of me all i need say is that after what
   ive learned i shudder at the thought of the world and what its been
   through the world is cursed old james and there have been whole
   chapters lived and closed before the dawn of our organic life and the
   geologic eras connected with it its an awful thoughtwhole forgotten
   cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseasesall
   lived through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the
   tropic seas geology tells us about

   i said gone but i didnt quite mean that it would have been better
   that way but it wasnt quite so in places traditions have kept oni
   cant tell you howand certain archaic lifeforms have managed to
   struggle thinly down the aeons in hidden spots there were cults you
   knowbands of evil priests in lands now buried under the sea atlantis
   was the hotbed that was a terrible place if heaven is merciful no
   one will ever drag up that horror from the deep

   it had a colony though that didnt sink; and when you get too
   confidential with one of the tuareg priests in africa hes likely to
   tell you wild tales about ittales that connect up with whispers
   youll hear among the mad lamas and flighty yakdrivers on the secret
   tablelands of asia id heard all the common tales and whispers when i
   came on the big one what that was youll never knowbut it pertained
   to somebody or something that had come down from a blasphemously long
   time ago and could be made to live againor seem alive againthrough
   certain processes that werent very clear to the man who told me

   now james in spite of my confession about the fever you know im
   not bad as a doctor i plugged hard at medicine and soaked up about as
   much as the next manmaybe a little more because down there in the
   hoggar country i did something no priest had ever been able to do they
   led me blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for
   generationsand i came back with surama

   easy james! i know what you want to say how does he know all he
   knows?why does he speak englishor any other language for that
   matterwithout an accent?why did he come away with me?and all
   that i cant tell you altogether but i can say that he takes in ideas
   and images and impressions with something besides his brain and senses
   he had a use for me and my science he told me things and opened up
   vistas he taught me to worship ancient primordial and unholy gods
   and mapped out a road to a terrible goal which i cant even hint to
   you dont press me jamesits for the sake of your sanity and the
   worlds sanity!

   the creature is beyond all bounds hes in league with the stars and
   all the forces of nature dont think im still crazy jamesi swear
   to you im not! ive had too many glimpses to doubt he gave me new
   pleasures that were forms of his palaeogean worship and the greatest
   of those was the black fever

   god james! havent you seen through the business by this time? do you
   still believe the black fever came out of thibet and that i learned
   about it there? use your brains man! look at millers article here!
   hes found a basic antitoxin that will end all fever within half a
   century when other men learn how to modify it for the different forms
   hes cut the ground of my youth from under medone what id have given
   my life to dotaken the wind out of all the honest sails i ever flung
   to the breeze of science! do you wonder his article gave me a turn? do
   you wonder it shocks me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my
   youth? too late! too late! but not too late to save others!

   i guess im rambling a bit now old man you knowthe hypodermic i
   asked you why you didnt tumble to the facts about black fever how
   could you though? doesnt miller say hes cured seven cases with his
   serum? a matter of diagnosis james he only thinks it is black fever
   i can read between his lines here old chap on page 551 is the key
   to the whole thing read it again

   you see dont you? the fever cases from the pacific coast didnt
   respond to his serum they puzzled him they didnt even seem like any
   true fever he knew well those were my cases! those were the real
   black fever cases! and there cant ever be an antitoxin on earth
   thatll cure black fever!

   how do i know? because black fever isnt of this earth! its from
   somewhere else jamesand surama alone knows where because he brought
   it here he brought it and i spread it! thats the secret james!
   thats all i wanted the appointment forthats all i ever didjust
   spread the fever that i carried in this gold syringe and in the
   deadlier fingerringpumpsyringe you see on my index finger! science?
   a blind! i wanted to kill and kill and kill! a single pressure on my
   finger and the black fever was inoculated i wanted to see living
   things writhe and squirm scream and froth at the mouth a single
   pressure of the pumpsyringe and i could watch them as they died and i
   couldnt live or think unless i had plenty to watch thats why i
   jabbed everything in sight with the accursed hollow needle animals
   criminals children servantsand the next would have been

   clarendons voice broke and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chair

   thatthat jameswasmy life surama made it sohe taught me and
   kept me at it till i couldnt stop thenthen it got too much even for
   him he tried to check me fancyhe trying to check anybody in that
   line! but now ive got my last specimen that is my last test good
   subject jamesim healthydevilish healthy deuced ironic
   thoughthe madness has gone now so there wont be any fun watching
   the agony! cant becant

   a violent shiver of fever racked the doctor and dalton mourned amidst
   his horrorstupefaction that he could give no grief how much of
   alfreds story was sheer nonsense and how much nightmare truth he
   could not say; but in any case he felt that the man was a victim rather
   than a criminal and above all he was a boyhood comrade and georginas
   brother thoughts of the old days came back kaleidoscopically little
   alfthe yard at phillips exeterthe quadrangle at columbiathe
   fight with tom cortland when he saved alf from a pommeling   

   he helped clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do
   there was nothing alfred could only whisper now but he asked
   forgiveness for all his offences and commended his sister to the care
   of his friend

   youyoullmake her happy he gasped she deserves it
   martyrtoa myth! make it up to her james
   dontletherknowmorethan she has to!

   his voice trailed off in a mumble and he fell into a stupor dalton
   rang the bell but margarita had gone to bed so he called up the
   stairs for georgina she was firm of step but very pale alfreds
   scream had tried her sorely but she had trusted james she trusted him
   still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge and asked her
   to go back to her room and rest no matter what sounds she might hear
   he did not wish her to witness the awful spectacle of delirium certain
   to come but bade her kiss her brother a final farewell as he lay there
   calm and still very like the delicate boy he had once been so she
   left himthe strange moonstruck starreading genius she had mothered
   so longand the picture she carried away was a very merciful one

   dalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture his fears of delirium
   were not vain and all through the black midnight hours his giant
   strength restrained the frenzied contortions of the mad sufferer what
   he heard from those swollen blackening lips he will never repeat he
   has never been quite the same man since and he knows that no one who
   hears such things can ever be wholly as he was before so for the
   worlds good he dares not speak and he thanks god that his laymans
   ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic and
   meaningless to him

   toward morning clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and
   began to speak in a firm voice

   james i didnt tell you what must be doneabout everything blot out
   these entries in greek and send my notebook to dr miller all my other
   notes too that youll find in the files hes the big authority
   todayhis article proves it your friend at the club was right but
   everything in the clinic must go everything without exception dead or
   alive orotherwise all the plagues of hell are in those bottles on
   the shelves burn themburn it allif one thing escapes surama will
   spread black death throughout the world and above all burn surama!
   thatthat thingmust not breathe the wholesome air of heaven you
   know nowwhat i told youyou know why such an entity cant be allowed
   on earth it wont be murdersurama isnt humanif youre as pious as
   you used to be james i shant have to urge you remember the old
   text`thou shalt not suffer a witch to liveor something of the
   sort

   burn him james! dont let him chuckle again over the torture of
   mortal flesh! i say burn himthe nemesis of flamethats all that
   can reach him james unless you can catch him asleep and drive a stake
   through his heart    kill himextirpate himcleanse the decent
   universe of its primal taintthe taint i recalled from its agelong
   sleep   

   the doctor had risen on his elbow and his voice was a piercing shriek
   toward the last the effort was too much however and he lapsed very
   suddenly into a deep tranquil coma dalton himself fearless of fever
   since he knew the dread germ to be noncontagious composed alfreds
   arms and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragile
   form after all mightnt much of this horror be exaggeration and
   delirium? mightnt old doc macneil pull him through on a long chance?
   the governor strove to keep awake and walked briskly up and down the
   room but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures a
   seconds rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands
   and he was presently sleeping soundly despite his best intentions

   dalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes and for a moment
   he thought the dawn had come but it was not the dawn and as he rubbed
   his heavy lids he saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in
   the yard whose stout planks flamed and roared and crackled heavenward
   in the most stupendous holocaust he had ever seen it was indeed the
   nemesis of flame that clarendon had wished and dalton felt that some
   strange combustibles must be involved in a blaze so much wilder than
   anything normal pine or redwood could afford he glanced alarmedly at
   the lounge but alfred was not there starting up he went to call
   georgina but met her in the hall roused as he was by the mountain of
   living fire

   the clinics burning down! she cried how is al now?

   hes disappeareddisappeared while i dropped asleep! replied dalton
   reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to
   sway

   gently leading her upstairs toward her room he promised to search at
   once for alfred but georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from
   outside cast a weird glow through the window on the landing

   he must be dead jameshe could never live sane and knowing what he
   did i heard him quarrelling with surama and know that awful things
   were going on he is my brother butit is best as it is

   her voice had sunk to a whisper

   suddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep hideous
   chuckle and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till
   they half resembled some nameless cyclopean creatures of nightmare
   james and georgina paused hesitant and peered out breathlessly through
   the landing window then from the sky came a thunderous peal as a
   forked bolt of lightning shot down with terrible directness into the
   very midst of the blazing ruin the deep chuckle ceased and in its
   place came a frantic ululant yelp as of a thousand ghouls and
   werewolves in torment it died away with long reverberant echoes and
   slowly the flames resumed their normal shape

   the watchers did not move but waited till the pillar of fire had
   shrunk to a smouldering glow they were glad of a halfrusticity which
   had kept the firemen from trooping out and of the wall that excluded
   the curious what had happened was not for vulgar eyesit involved too
   much of the universes inner secrets for that

   in the pale dawn james spoke softly to georgina who could do no more
   than put her head on his breast and sob

   sweetheart i think he has atoned he must have set the fire you
   know while i was asleep he told me it ought to be burnedthe clinic
   and everything in it surama too it was the only way to save the
   world from the unknown horrors he had loosed upon it he knew and he
   did what was best

   he was a great man georgie lets never forget that we must always
   be proud of him for he started out to help mankind and was titanic
   even in his sins ill tell you more sometime what he did be it good
   or evil was what no man ever did before he was the first and last to
   break through certain veils and even apollonius of tyana takes second
   place beside him but we mustnt talk about that we must remember him
   only as the little alf we knewas the boy who wanted to master
   medicine and conquer fever

   in the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found
   two skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adheringonly two thanks
   to the undisturbed limepits one was of a man; the other is still a
   subject of debate among the biologists of the coast it was not exactly
   an apes or a saurians skeleton but it had disturbing suggestions of
   lines of evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace the
   charred skull oddly enough was very human and reminded people of
   surama; but the rest of the bones were beyond conjecture only wellcut
   clothing could have made such a body look like a man

   but the human bones were clarendons no one disputed this and the
   world at large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor
   of his age; the bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have
   far eclipsed dr millers kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to
   perfection much of millers late success indeed is credited to the
   notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames of the old
   rivalry and hatred almost none survived and even dr wilfred jones has
   been known to boast of his association with the vanished leader

   james dalton and his wife georgina have always preserved a reticence
   which modesty and family grief might well account for they published
   certain notes as a tribute to the great mans memory but have never
   confirmed or contradicted either the popular estimate or the rare hints
   of marvels that a very few keen thinkers have been known to whisper it
   was very subtly and slowly that the facts filtered out dalton probably
   gave dr macneil an inkling of the truth and that good soul had not
   many secrets from his son

   the daltons have led on the whole a very happy life; for their cloud
   of terror lies far in the background and a strong mutual love has kept
   the world fresh for them but there are things which disturb them
   oddlylittle things of which one would scarcely ever think of
   complaining they cannot bear persons who are lean or deepvoiced
   beyond certain limits and georgina turns pale at the sound of any
   guttural chuckling senator dalton has a mixed horror of occultism
   travel hypodermics and strange alphabets which most find hard to
   unify and there are still those who blame him for the vast proportion
   of the doctors library that he destroyed with such painstaking
   completeness

   macneil though seemed to realise he was a simple man and he said a
   prayer as the last of alfred clarendons strange books crumbled to
   ashes nor would anyone who had peered understandingly within those
   books wish a word of that prayer unsaid

   heave to theres something floating to the leeward the speaker was a
   short stockily built man whose name was william jones he was the
   captain of a small cat boat in which he & a party of men were sailing
   at the time the story opens aye aye sir answered john towers & the
   boat was brought to a stand still captain jones reached out his hand
   for the object which he now discerned to be a glass bottle nothing but
   a rum flask that the men on a passing boat threw over he said but from
   an impulse of curiosity he reached out for it it was a rum flask & he
   was about to throw it away when he noticed a piece of paper in it he
   pulled it out & on it read the following jan 1 1864 i am john jones who
   writes this letter my ship is fast sinking with a treasure on board i
   am where it is marked  on the enclosed chart captain jones turned the
   sheet over & the other side was a chart on the edge were written these
   words

   dotted lines represent course we took

   towers said capt jones exitedly read this towers did as he was
   directed i think it would pay to go said capt jones do you? just
   as you say replied towers well charter a schooner this very day
   said the exited captain all right said towers so they hired a boat
   and started off govnd by the dotted lines of they chart in 4 weeks the
   reached the place where directed & the divers went down and came up
   with an iron bottle they found in it the following lines scribbled on a
   piece of brown paper dec 3 1880 dear searcher excuse me for the
   practical joke i have played on you but it serves you right to find
   nothing for your foolish act well it does said capt jones go on
   however i will defray your expenses to & from the place you found your
   bottle i think it will be $25000 so that amount you will find in an
   iron box i know where you found the bottle because i put this bottle
   here & the iron box & then found a good place to put the second bottle
   hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some i
   closeanonymus id like to kick his head off said capt jones here
   diver go & get the $25000 in a minute the diver came up bearing an
   iron box inside it was found $25000 it defrayed their expenses but i
   hardly think that they will ever go to a mysterious place as directed
   by a mysterious bottle

i the shadow on the chimney[edit]

   there was thunder in the air on the night i went to the deserted
   mansion atop tempest mountain to find the lurking fear i was not
   alone for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the
   grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests
   for strange horrors in literature and in life with me were two
   faithful and muscular men for whom i had sent when the time came; men
   long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their
   peculiar fitness

   we had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who
   still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before  the
   nightmare creeping death later i thought they might aid me; but i
   did not want them then would to god i had let them share the search
   that i might not have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear it
   alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the
   demon implications of the thing now that i am telling it anyway lest
   the brooding make me a maniac i wish i had never concealed it for i
   and i only know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and
   desolate mountain

   in a small motorcar we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill
   until the wooded ascent checked it the country bore an aspect more
   than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the
   accustomed crowds of investigators so that we were often tempted to
   use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract it
   was not a wholesome landscape after dark and i believe i would have
   noticed its morbidity even had i been ignorant of the terror that
   stalked there of wild creatures there were nonethey are wise when
   death leers close the ancient lightningscarred trees seemed
   unnaturally large and twisted and the other vegetation unnaturally
   thick and feverish while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy
   fulguritepitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead mens skulls
   swelled to gigantic proportions

   fear had lurked on tempest mountain for more than a century this i
   learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first
   brought the region to the worlds notice the place is a remote lonely
   elevation in that part of the catskills where dutch civilization once
   feebly and transiently penetrated leaving behind as it receded only a
   few mined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting
   pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes normal beings seldom visited the
   locality till the state police were formed and even now only
   infrequent troopers patrol it the fear however is an old tradition
   throughout the neighboring villages; since it is a prime topic in the
   simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys
   to trade handwoven baskets for such primitive necessities as they
   cannot shoot raise or make

   the lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted martense mansion
   which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent
   thunderstorms gave it the name of tempest mountain for over a hundred
   years the antique grovecircled stone house had been the subject of
   stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent
   colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer with whimpering
   insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized lone
   wayfarers after dark either carrying them off or leaving them in a
   frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered
   of blood trails toward the distant mansion some said the thunder
   called the lurking fear out of its habitation while others said the
   thunder was its voice

   no one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting
   stories with their incoherent extravagant descriptions of the
   hallglimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the
   martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted local history forbade such a
   doubt although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such
   investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid
   tale of the squatters grandmothers told strange myths of the martense
   spectre; myths concerning the martense family itself its queer
   hereditary dissimilarity of eyes its long unnatural annals and the
   murder which had cursed it

   the terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous
   confirmation of the mountaineers wildest legends one summer night
   after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence the countryside was
   aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create the
   pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror
   which had descended upon them and they were not doubted they had not
   seen it but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they
   knew a creeping death had come

   in the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering
   mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come death was
   indeed there the ground under one of the squatters villages had caved
   in after a lightning stroke destroying several of the malodorous
   shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic
   devastation which paled it to insignificance of a possible
   seventyfive natives who had inhabited this spot not one living
   specimen was visible the disordered earth was covered with blood and
   human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of demon teeth and
   talons; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage that some
   hideous animal must be the cause everyone quickly agreed; nor did any
   tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the
   sordid murders common in decadent communities that charge was revived
   only when about twentyfive of the estimated population were found
   missing from the dead; and even then it was hard to explain the murder
   of fifty by half that number but the fact remained that on a summer
   night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose
   corpses were horribly mangled chewed and clawed

   the excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the
   haunted martense mansion though the localities were over three miles
   apart the troopers were more skeptical; including the mansion only
   casually in their investigations and dropping it altogether when they
   found it thoroughly deserted country and village people however
   canvassed the place with infinite care; overturning everything in the
   house sounding ponds and brooks beating down bushes and ransacking
   the nearby forests all was in vain; the death that had come had left
   no trace save destruction itself

   by the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the
   newspapers whose reporters overran tempest mountain they described it
   in much detail and with many interviews to elucidate the horrors
   history as told by local grandams i followed the accounts languidly at
   first for i am a connoisseur in horrors; but after a week i detected
   an atmosphere which stirred me oddly so that on august 5th 1921 i
   registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at lefferts
   corners nearest village to tempest mountain and acknowledged
   headquarters of the searchers three weeks more and the dispersal of
   the reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the
   minute inquiries and surveying with which i had meanwhile busied
   myself

   so on this summer night while distant thunder rumbled i left a silent
   motorcar and tramped with two armed companions up the last
   moundcovered reaches of tempest mountain casting the beams of an
   electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through
   giant oaks ahead in this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting
   illumination the vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror
   which day could not uncover; yet i did not hesitate since i had come
   with fierce resolution to test an idea i believed that the thunder
   called the deathdemon out of some fearsome secret place; and be that
   demon solid entity or vaporous pestilence i meant to see it

   i had thoroughly searched the ruin before hence knew my plan well;
   choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of jan martense whose
   murder looms so great in the rural legends i felt subtly that the
   apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes the chamber
   measuring about twenty feet square contained like the other rooms some
   rubbish which had once been furniture it lay on the second story on
   the southeast corner of the house and had an immense east window and
   narrow south window both devoid of panes or shutters opposite the
   large window was an enormous dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles
   representing the prodigal son and opposite the narrow window was a
   spacious bed built into the wall

   as the treemuffled thunder grew louder i arranged my plans details
   first i fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three
   rope ladders which i had brought with me i knew they reached a
   suitable spot on the grass outside for i had tested them then the
   three of us dragged from another room a wide fourposter bedstead
   crowding it laterally against the window having strewn it with fir
   boughs all now rested on it with drawn automatics two relaxing while
   the third watched from whatever direction the demon might come our
   potential escape was provided if it came from within the house we had
   the window ladders; if from outside the door and the stairs we did not
   think judging from precedent that it would pursue us far even at
   worst

   i watched from midnight to one oclock when in spite of the sinister
   house the unprotected window and the approaching thunder and
   lightning i felt singularly drowsy i was between my two companions
   george bennett being toward the window and william tobey toward the
   fireplace bennett was asleep having apparently felt the same
   anomalous drowsiness which affected me so i designated tobey for the
   next watch although even he was nodding it is curious how intently i
   had been watching the fireplace

   the increasing thunder must have affected my dreams for in the brief
   time i slept there came to me apocalyptic visions once i partly
   awaked probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly
   flung an arm across my chest i was not sufficiently awake to see
   whether tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel but felt a
   distinct anxiety on that score never before had the presence of evil
   so poignantly oppressed me later i must have dropped asleep again for
   it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night
   grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or
   imagination

   in that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed
   hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion i awoke to red
   madness and the mockery of diabolism as farther and farther down
   inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and
   reverberated there was no light but i knew from the empty space at my
   right that tobey was gone god alone knew whither across my chest
   still lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left

   then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole
   mountain lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove and splintered the
   patriarch of the twisted trees in the demon flash of a monstrous
   fireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond
   the window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the
   fireplace from which my eyes had never strayed that i am still alive
   and sane is a marvel i cannot fathom i cannot fathom it for the
   shadow on that chimney was not that of george bennett or of any other
   human creature but a blasphemous abnormality from hells nethermost
   craters; a nameless shapeless abomination which no mind could fully
   grasp and no pen even partly describe in another second i was alone in
   the accursed mansion shivering and gibbering george bennett and
   william tobey had left no trace not even of a struggle they were
   never heard of again

ii a passer in the storm[edit]

   for days after that hideous experience in the forestswathed mansion i
   lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at lefferts corners i do not
   remember exactly how i managed to reach the motorcar start it and
   slip unobserved back to the village; for i retain no distinct
   impression save of wildarmed titan trees demoniac mutterings of
   thunder and charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and
   streaked the region

   as i shivered and brooded on the casting of that brainblasting shadow
   i knew that i had at last pried out one of earths supreme horrors 
   one of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon
   scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space yet from
   which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity the
   shadow i had seen i hardly dared to analyse or identify something had
   lain between me and the window that night but i shuddered whenever i
   could not cast off the instinct to classify it if it had only snarled
   or bayed or laughed titteringlyeven that would have relieved the
   abysmal hideousness but it was so silent it had rested a heavy arm or
   foreleg on my chest

   obviously it was organic or had once been organic jan martense
   whose room i had invaded was buried in the graveyard near the
   mansion i must find bennett and tobey if they lived why had it
   picked them and left me for the last? drowsiness is so stifling
   and dreams are so horrible

   in a short time i realised that i must tell my story to someone or
   break down completely i had already decided not to abandon the quest
   for the lurking fear for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that
   uncertainty was worse than enlightenment however terrible the latter
   might prove to be accordingly i resolved in my mind the best course to
   pursue; whom to select for my confidences and how to track down the
   thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow

   my chief acquaintances at lefferts corners had been the affable
   reporters of whom several had still remained to collect final echoes
   of the tragedy it was from these that i determined to choose a
   colleague and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined
   toward one arthur munroe a dark lean man of about thirtyfive whose
   education taste intelligence and temperament all seemed to mark him
   as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences

   on an afternoon in early september arthur munroe listened to my story
   i saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic
   and when i had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the
   greatest shrewdness and judgement his advice moreover was eminently
   practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the
   martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed
   historical and geographical data on his initiative we combed the
   countryside for information regarding the terrible martense family and
   discovered a man who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral
   diary we also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as
   had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes and slope
   again scanned for dens and caves but all without result and yet as i
   have said vague new fears hovered menacingly over us; as if giant
   batwinged gryphons looked on transcosmic gulfs

   as the afternoon advanced it became increasingly difficult to see; and
   we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain
   this sound in such a locality naturally stirred us though less than it
   would have done at night as it was we hoped desperately that the
   storm would last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from
   our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to
   gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation timid as
   they were a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our
   protective leadership to promise such help

   we had hardly more than turned however when there descended such a
   blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative the
   extreme almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble
   badly but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our
   minute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin
   of the lot; an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still
   existing door and single tiny window both faced maple hill barring the
   door after us against the fury of the wind and rain we put in place
   the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught us
   where to find it was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the
   pitchy darkness but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our
   pocket lamps about now and then we could see the lightning through
   cracks in the wall; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each
   flash was extremely vivid

   the stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on
   tempest mountain my mind turned to that odd question which had kept
   recurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened; and again i
   wondered why the demon approaching the three watchers either from the
   window or the interior had begun with the men on each side and left
   the middle man till the last when the titan fireball had scared it
   away why had it not taken its victims in natural order with myself
   second from whichever direction it had approached? with what manner of
   farreaching tentacles did it prey? or did it know that i was the
   leader and saved me for a fate worse than that of my companions?

   in the midst of these reflections as if dramatically arranged to
   intensify them there fell nearby a terrific bolt of lightning followed
   by the sound of sliding earth at the same time the wolfish wind rose
   to demoniac crescendos of ululation we were sure that the one tree on
   maple hill had been struck again and munroe rose from his box and went
   to the tiny window to ascertain the damage when he took down the
   shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in so that i could not
   hear what he said; but i waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom
   natures pandemonium

   gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness
   told of the storms passing i had hoped it would last into the night
   to help our quest but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me
   removed the likelihood of such a thing suggesting to munroe that we
   had better get some light even if more showers came i unbarred and
   opened the crude door the ground outside was a singular mass of mud
   and pools with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but i
   saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently
   leaning out the window crossing to where he leaned i touched his
   shoulder; but he did not move then as i playfully shook him and
   turned him around i felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror
   whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the
   night that broods beyond time

   for arthur munroe was dead and on what remained of his chewed and
   gouged head there was no longer a face

iii what the red glare meant[edit]

   on the tempestracked night of november 8 1921 with a lantern which
   cast charnel shadows i stood digging alone and idiotically in the
   grave of jan martense i had begun to dig in the afternoon because a
   thunderstorm was brewing and now that it was dark and the storm had
   burst above the maniacally thick foliage i was glad

   i believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since august 5th;
   the demon shadow in the mansion the general strain and disappointment
   and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an october storm after
   that thing i had dug a grave for one whose death i could not
   understand i knew that others could not understand either so let them
   think arthur munroe had wandered away they searched but found
   nothing the squatters might have understood but i dared not frighten
   them more i myself seemed strangely callous that shock at the mansion
   had done something to my brain and i could think only of the quest for
   a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest
   which the fate of arthur munroe made me vow to keep silent and
   solitary

   the scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any
   ordinary man baleful primal trees of unholy size age and
   grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish druidic
   temple; muffling the thunder hushing the clawing wind and admitting
   but little rain beyond the scarred trunks in the background illumined
   by faint flashes of filtered lightning rose the damp ivied stones of
   the deserted mansion while somewhat nearer was the abandoned dutch
   garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white fungous foetid
   overnourished vegetation that never saw full daylight and nearest of
   all was the graveyard where deformed trees tossed insane branches as
   their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay
   below now and then beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and
   festered in the antediluvian forest darkness i could trace the
   sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterized the
   lightningpierced region

   history had led me to this archaic grave history indeed was all i
   had after everything else ended in mocking satanism i now believed
   that the lurking fear was no material being but a wolffanged ghost
   that rode the midnight lightning and i believed because of the masses
   of local tradition i had unearthed in search with arthur munroe that
   the ghost was that of jan martense who died in 1762 this is why i was
   digging idiotically in his grave

   the martense mansion was built in 1670 by gerrit martense a wealthy
   newamsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under british
   rule and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote
   woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased
   him the only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was
   that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer
   when selecting the hill and building his mansion mynheer martense had
   laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year;
   but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to
   such phenomena at length having found these storms injurious to his
   head he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their
   wildest pandemonium

   of gerrit martenses descendants less is known than of himself; since
   they were all reared in hatred of the english civilisation and trained
   to shun such of the colonists as accepted it their life was
   exceedingly secluded and people declared that their isolation had made
   them heavy of speech and comprehension in appearance all were marked
   by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue
   and the other brown their social contacts grew fewer and fewer till
   at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about
   the estate many of the crowded family degenerated moved across the
   valley and merged with the mongrel population which was later to
   produce the pitiful squatters the rest had stuck sullenly to their
   ancestral mansion becoming more and more clannish and taciturn yet
   developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms

   most of this information reached the outside world through young jan
   martense who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army
   when news of the albany convention reached tempest mountain he was the
   first of gerrits descendants to see much of the world; and when he
   returned in 1760 after six years of campaigning he was hated as an
   outsider by his father uncles and brothers in spite of his
   dissimilar martense eyes no longer could he share the peculiarities
   and prejudices of the martenses while the very mountain thunderstorms
   failed to intoxicate him as they had before instead his surroundings
   depressed him; and he frequently wrote to a friend in albany of plans
   to leave the paternal roof

   in the spring of 1763 jonathan gifford the albany friend of jan
   martense became worried by his correspondents silence; especially in
   view of the conditions and quarrels at the martense mansion determined
   to visit jan in person he went into the mountains on horseback his
   diary states that he reached tempest mountain on september 20 finding
   the mansion in great decrepitude the sullen oddeyed martenses whose
   unclean animal aspect shocked him told him in broken gutterals that
   jan was dead he had they insisted been struck by lightning the
   autumn before; and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens
   they showed the visitor the grave barren and devoid of markers
   something in the martenses manner gave gifford a feeling of repulsion
   and suspicion and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to
   explore the sepulchral spot he found what he expected  a skull
   crushed cruelly as if by savage blows  so returning to albany he
   openly charged the martenses with the murder of their kinsman

   legal evidence was lacking but the story spread rapidly round the
   countryside; and from that time the martenses were ostracised by the
   world no one would deal with them and their distant manor was shunned
   as an accursed place somehow they managed to live on independently by
   the product of their estate for occasional lights glimpsed from
   faraway hills attested their continued presence these lights were
   seen as late as 1810 but toward the last they became very infrequent

   meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of
   diabolic legendry the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness
   and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply it
   remained unvisited till 1816 when the continued absence of lights was
   noticed by the squatters at that time a party made investigations
   finding the house deserted and partly in ruins

   there were no skeletons about so that departure rather than death was
   inferred the clan seemed to have left several years before and
   improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to its
   migration its cultural level had fallen very low as proved by
   decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long
   abandoned when its owners left but though the dreaded martenses were
   gone the fear of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute when
   new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents there it
   stood; deserted feared and linked with the vengeful ghost of jan
   martense there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martenses
   grave

   i have described my protracted digging as idiotic and such it indeed
   was in object and method the coffin of jan martense had soon been
   unearthedit now held only dust and nitre  but in my fury to exhume
   his ghost i delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had
   lain god knows what i expected to findi only felt that i was digging
   in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night

   it is impossible to say what monstrous depth i had attained when my
   spade and soon my feet broke through the ground beneath the event
   under the circumstances was tremendous; for in the existence of a
   subterranean space here my mad theories had terrible confirmation my
   slight fall had extinguished the lantern but i produced an electric
   pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away
   indefinitely in both directions it was amply large enough for a man to
   wriggle through; and though no sane person would have tried at that
   time i forgot danger reason and cleanliness in my singleminded
   fever to unearth the lurking fear choosing the direction toward the
   house i scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow; squirming ahead
   blindly and rapidly and flashing but seldom the lamp i kept before me

   what language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely
   abysmal earth; pawing twisting wheezing; scrambling madly through
   sunken convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time
   safety direction or definite object? there is something hideous in
   it but that is what i did i did it for so long that life faded to a
   far memory and i became one with the moles and grubs of nighted
   depths indeed it was only by accident that after interminable
   writhings i jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight so that it shone
   eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead

   i had been scrambling in this way for some time so that my battery had
   burned very low when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward
   altering my mode of progress and as i raised my glance it was without
   preparation that i saw glistening in the distance two demoniac
   reflections of my expiring lamp; two reflections glowing with a baneful
   and unmistakable effulgence and provoking maddeningly nebulous
   memories i stopped automatically though lacking the brain to retreat
   the eyes approached yet of the thing that bore them i could
   distinguish only a claw but what a claw! then far overhead i heard a
   faint crashing which i recognized it was the wild thunder of the
   mountain raised to hysteric fury  i must have been crawling upward
   for some time so that the surface was now quite near and as the
   muffled thunder clattered those eyes still stared with vacuous
   viciousness

   thank god i did not then know what it was else i should have died but
   i was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it for after a
   hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those
   frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath i had noticed here and
   there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes
   with cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit
   blinding and deafening me yet not wholly reducing me to a coma in the
   chaos of sliding shifting earth i clawed and floundered helplessly
   till the rain on my head steadied me and i saw that i had come to the
   surface in a familiar spot; a steep unforested place on the southwest
   slope of the mountain recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled
   ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched
   down from the wooded higher slope but there was nothing in the chaos
   to show my place of egress from the lethal catacomb my brain was as
   great a chaos as the earth and as a distant red glare burst on the
   landscape from the south i hardly realised the horror i had been
   through

   but when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant
   i felt more horror than that which the mouldburrow and the claw and
   eyes had given; more horror because of the overwhelming implications
   in a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt
   which brought me above ground and a nameless thing had dropped from an
   overhanging tree into a weakroofed cabin it had done a deed but the
   squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape it had
   been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing
   with the claw and eyes

iv the horror in the eyes[edit]

   there can be nothing normal in the mind of one who knowing what i knew
   of the horrors of tempest mountain would seek alone for the fear that
   lurked there that at least two of the fears embodiments were
   destroyed formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety
   in this acheron of multiform diabolism; yet i continued my quest with
   even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous
   when two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes
   and claw i learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away
   at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me i experienced virtual
   convulsions of fright but that fright was so mixed with wonder and
   alluring grotesqueness that it was almost a pleasant sensation
   sometimes in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one
   over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis
   it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself
   voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dreamdoom into whatever
   bottomless gulf may yawn and so it was with the walking nightmare of
   tempest mountain; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot
   gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the
   accursed region and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from
   every inch of the poisonous soil

   as soon as possible i visited the grave of jan martense and dug vainly
   where i had dug before some extensive cavein had obliterated all
   trace of the underground passage while the rain had washed so much
   earth back into the excavation that i could not tell how deeply i had
   dug that other day i likewise made a difficult trip to the distant
   hamlet where the deathcreature had been burnt and was little repaid
   for my trouble in the ashes of the fateful cabin i found several
   bones but apparently none of the monsters the squatters said the
   thing had had only one victim; but in this i judged them inaccurate
   since besides the complete skull of a human being there was another
   bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull
   at some time though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen no
   one could say just what the creature was like; those who had glimpsed
   it called it simply a devil examining the great tree where it had
   lurked i could discern no distinctive marks i tried to find some
   trail into the black forest but on this occasion could not stand the
   sight of those morbidly large boles or of those vast serpentlike
   roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth

   my next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet
   where death had come most abundantly and where arthur munroe had seen
   something he never lived to describe though my vain previous searches
   had been exceedingly minute i now had new data to test; for my
   horrible gravecrawl convinced me that at least one of the phases of
   the monstrosity had been an underground creature this time on the
   14th of november my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of
   cone mountain and maple hill where they overlook the unfortunate
   hamlet and i gave particular attention to the loose earth of the
   landslide region on the latter eminence

   the afternoon of my search brought nothing to light and dusk came as i
   stood on maple hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to
   tempest mountain there had been a gorgeous sunset and now the moon
   came up nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain the
   distant mountainside and the curious low mounds that rose here and
   there it was a peaceful arcadian scene but knowing what it hid i
   hated it i hated the mocking moon the hypocritical plain the
   festering mountain and those sinister mounds everything seemed to me
   tainted with a loathsome contagion and inspired by a noxious alliance
   with distorted hidden powers

   presently as i gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama my eye
   became attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of
   a certain topographical element without having any exact knowledge of
   geology i had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and
   hummocks of the region i had noticed that they were pretty widely
   distributed around tempest mountain though less numerous on the plain
   than near the hilltop itself where prehistoric glaciation had
   doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic
   caprices now in the light of that low moon which cast long weird
   shadows it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the
   mound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of tempest mountain
   that summit was undeniably a centre from which the lines or rows of
   points radiated indefinitely and irregularly as if the unwholesome
   martense mansion had thrown visible tentacles of terror the idea of
   such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill and i stopped to analyse
   my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomena

   the more i analysed the less i believed and against my newly opened
   mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on
   superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth before i
   knew it i was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself; my
   god! molehills the damned place must be honeycombed how
   many that night at the mansion they took bennett and tobey
   first on each side of us then i was digging frantically into the
   mound which had stretched nearest me; digging desperately shiveringly
   but almost jubilantly; digging and at last shrieking aloud with some
   unplaced emotion as i came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one
   through which i had crawled on the other demoniac night

   after that i recall running spade in hand; a hideous run across
   moonlitten moundmarked meadows and through diseased precipitous
   abysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping screaming panting
   bounding toward the terrible martense mansion i recall digging
   unreasonably in all parts of the brierchoked cellar; digging to find
   the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds and then i
   recall how i laughed when i stumbled on the passageway; the hole at the
   base of the old chimney where the thick weeds grew and cast queer
   shadows in the light of the lone candle i had happened to have with me
   what still remained down in that hellhive lurking and waiting for the
   thunder to arouse it i did not know two had been killed; perhaps that
   had finished it but still there remained that burning determination to
   reach the innermost secret of the fear which i had once more come to
   deem definite material and organic

   my indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and
   immediately with my pocketlight or to try to assemble a band of
   squatters for the quest was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush
   of wind from the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark
   blackness the moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures
   above me and with a sense of fateful alarm i heard the sinister and
   significant rumble of approaching thunder a confusion of associated
   ideas possessed my brain leading me to grope back toward the farthest
   corner of the cellar my eyes however never turned away from the
   horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and i began to get
   glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of
   lightning penetrated the weeds outside and illumined the chinks in the
   upper wall every second i was consumed with a mixture of fear and
   curiosity what would the storm call forthor was there anything left
   for it to call? guided by a lightning flash i settled myself down
   behind a dense clump of vegetation through which i could see the
   opening without being seen

   if heaven is merciful it will some day efface from my consciousness
   the sight that i saw and let me live my last years in peace i cannot
   sleep at night now and have to take opiates when it thunders the
   thing came abruptly and unannounced; a demon ratlike scurrying from
   pits remote and unimaginable a hellish panting and stifled grunting
   and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous
   and leprous life  a loathsome nightspawned flood of organic
   corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of
   mortal madness and morbidity seething stewing surging bubbling like
   serpents slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole spreading
   like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of
   egress  streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests
   and strew fear madness and death

   god knows how many there were  there must have been thousands to see
   the stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking
   when they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms
   i saw that they were dwarfed deformed hairy devils or apesmonstrous
   and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe they were so hideously
   silent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers
   turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed
   fashion on a weaker companion 0thers snapped up what it left and ate
   with slavering relish then in spite of my daze of fright and disgust
   my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities
   oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare i drew my
   automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder

   shrieking slithering torrential shadows of red viscous madness
   chasing one another through endless ensanguined condors of purple
   fulgurous sky formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a
   ghoulish remembered scene; forests of monstrous overnourished oaks
   with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth
   verminous with millions of cannibal devils; moundlike tentacles
   groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion insane
   lightning over malignant ivied walls and demon arcades choked with
   fungous vegetation heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me
   unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that
   slept under the calm stars of clearing skies

   i had recovered enough in a week to send to albany for a gang of men to
   blow up the martense mansion and the entire top of tempest mountain
   with dynamite stop up all the discoverable moundburrows and destroy
   certain overnourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to
   sanity i could sleep a little after they had done this but true rest
   will never come as long as i remember that nameless secret of the
   lurking fear the thing will haunt me for who can say the
   extermination is complete and that analogous phenomena do not exist
   all over the world? who can with my knowledge think of the earths
   unknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities? i
   cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering why cannot
   the doctors give me something to make me sleep or truly calm my brain
   when it thunders?

   what i saw in the glow of flashlight after i shot the unspeakable
   straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before i
   understood and went delirious the object was nauseous; a filthy
   whitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur it was
   the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome
   of isolated spawning multiplication and cannibal nutrition above and
   below the ground; the embodiment of all the snarling and chaos and
   grinning fear that lurk behind life it had looked at me as it died
   and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes
   which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections
   one eye was blue the other brown they were the dissimilar martense
   eyes of the old legends and i knew in one inundating cataclysm of
   voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family; the terrible
   and thundercrazed house of martense

   the man of stone  (1932)
   by h p lovecraft and hazel heald
   1364034the man of stoneby h p lovecraft and hazel heald1932

   ben hayden was always a stubborn chap and once he had heard about
   those strange statues in the upper adirondacks nothing could keep him
   from going to see them i had been his closest acquaintance for years
   and our damon and pythias friendship made us inseparable at all times
   so when ben firmly decided to gowell i had to trot along too like a
   faithful collie

   jack he said you know henry jackson who was up in a shack beyond
   lake placid for that beastly spot in his lung? well he came back the
   other day nearly cured but had a lot to say about some devilish queer
   conditions up there he ran into the business all of a sudden and cant
   be sure yet that its anything more than a case of bizarre sculpture;
   but just the same his uneasy impression sticks

   it seems he was out hunting one day and came across a cave with what
   looked like a dog in front of it just as he was expecting the dog to
   bark he looked again and saw that the thing wasnt alive at all it
   was a stone dogsuch a perfect image down to the smallest whisker
   that he couldnt decide whether it was a supernaturally clever statue
   or a petrified animal he was almost afraid to touch it but when he
   did he realised it was surely made of stone

   after a while he nerved himself up to go into the caveand there he
   got a still bigger jolt only a little way in there was another stone
   figureor what looked like itbut this time it was a mans it lay on
   the floor on its side wore clothes and had a peculiar smile on its
   face this time henry didnt stop to do any touching but beat it
   straight for the village mountain top you know of course he asked
   questionsbut they did not get him very far he found he was on a
   ticklish subject for the natives only shook their heads crossed their
   fingers and muttered something about a `mad danwhoever he was

   it was too much for jackson so he came home weeks ahead of his
   planned time he told me all about it because he knows how fond i am of
   strange thingsand oddly enough i was able to fish up a recollection
   that dovetailed pretty neatly with his yarn do you remember arthur
   wheeler the sculptor who was such a realist that people began calling
   him nothing but a solid photographer? i think you knew him slightly
   well as a matter of fact he ended up in that part of the adirondacks
   himself spent a lot of time there and then dropped out of sight
   never heard from again now if stone statues that look like men and
   dogs are turning up around there it looks to me as if they might be
   his workno matter what the rustics say or refuse to say about them
   of course a fellow with jacksons nerves might easily get flighty and
   disturbed over things like that; but id have done a lot of examining
   before running away

   in fact jack im going up there now to look things overand youre
   coming along with me it would mean a lot to find wheeleror any of
   his work anyhow the mountain air will brace us both up

   so less than a week later after a long train ride and a jolting bus
   trip through breathlessly exquisite scenery we arrived at mountain top
   in the late golden sunlight of a june evening the village comprised
   only a few small houses a hotel and the general store at which our
   bus drew up; but we knew that the latter would probably prove a focus
   for such information surely enough the usual group of idlers was
   gathered around the steps; and when we represented ourselves as
   healthseekers in search of lodgings they had many recommendations to
   offer

   though we had not planned to do any investigating till the next day
   ben could not resist venturing some vague cautious questions when he
   noticed the senile garrulousness of one of the illclad loafers he
   felt from jacksons previous experience that it would be useless to
   begin with references to the queer statues; but decided to mention
   wheeler as one whom we had known and in whose fate we consequently had
   a right to be interested

   the crowd seemed uneasy when sam stopped his whittling and started
   talking but they had slight occasion for alarm even this barefoot old
   mountain decadent tightened up when he heard wheelers name and only
   with difficulty could ben get anything coherent out of him wheeler?
   he had finally wheezed oh yehthat feller as was all the time
   blastin rocks and cuttin em up into statues so yew knowed him hey?
   wal they aint much we kin tell ye and mebbe thats too much he
   stayed out to mad dans cabin in the hillsbut not so very long got
   so he want wanted no more    by dan that is kinder softspoken
   and got around dans wife till the old devil took notice pretty sweet
   on her i guess but he took the trail sudden and nobodys seen hide
   nor hair of him since dan must a told him sumthin pretty plainbad
   feller to get agin ye dan is! better keep away from thar boys for
   they aint no good in that part of the hills dans ben workin up a
   worse and worse mood and aint seen about no more nor his wife
   neither guess hes penned her up sos nobody else kin make eyes at
   her!

   as sam resumed his whittling after a few more observations ben and i
   exchanged glances here surely was a new lead which deserved
   intensive following up deciding to lodge at the hotel we settled
   ourselves as quickly as possible; planning for a plunge into the wild
   hilly country on the next day

   at sunrise we made our start each bearing a knapsack laden with
   provisions and such tools as we thought we might need the day before
   us had an almost stimulating air of invitationthrough which only a
   faint undercurrent of the sinister ran our rough mountain road quickly
   became steep and winding so that before long our feet ached
   considerably

   after about two miles we left the roadcrossing a stone wall on our
   right near a great elm and striking off diagonally toward a steeper
   slope according to the chart and directions which jackson had prepared
   for us it was rough and briery travelling but we knew that the cave
   could not be far off in the end we came upon the aperture quite
   suddenlya black bushgrown crevice where the ground shot abruptly
   upward and beside it near a shallow rock pool a small still figure
   stood rigidas if rivalling its own uncanny petrification

   it was a grey dogor a dogs statueand as our simultaneous gasp died
   away we scarcely knew what to think jackson had exaggerated nothing
   and we could not believe that any sculptors hand had succeeded in
   producing such perfection every hair of the animals magnificent coat
   seemed distinct and those on the back were bristled up as if some
   unknown thing had taken him unaware ben at last halfkindly touching
   the delicate stony fur gave vent to an exclamation

   good god jack but this cant be any statue! look at itall the
   little details and the way the hair lies! none of wheelers technique
   here! this is a real dogthough heaven only knows how he ever got in
   this state just like stonefeel for yourself do you suppose theres
   any strange gas that sometimes comes out of the cave and does this to
   animal life? we ought to have looked more into the local legends and
   if this is a real dogor was a real dogthen that man inside must be
   the real thing too

   it was with a good deal of genuine solemnityalmost dreadthat we
   finally crawled on hands and knees through the cavemouth ben leading
   the narrowness looked hardly three feet after which the grotto
   expanded in every direction to form a damp twilight chamber floored
   with rubble and detritus for a time we could make out very little but
   as we rose to our feet and strained our eyes we began slowly to descry
   a recumbent figure amidst the greater darkness ahead ben fumbled with
   his flashlight but hesitated for a moment before turning it on the
   prostrate figure we had little doubt that the stony thing was what had
   once been a man and something in the thought unnerved us both

   when ben at last sent forth the electric beam we saw that the object
   lay on its side back toward us it was clearly of the same material as
   the dog outside but was dressed in the mouldering and unpetrified
   remains of rough sport clothing braced as we were for a shock we
   approached quite calmly to examine the thing; ben going around to the
   other side to glimpse the averted face neither could possibly have
   been prepared for what ben saw when he flashed the light on those stony
   features his cry was wholly excusable and i could not help echoing it
   as i leaped to his side and shared the sight yet it was nothing
   hideous or intrinsically terrifying it was merely a matter of
   recognition for beyond the least shadow of a doubt this chilly rock
   figure with its halffrightened halfbitter expression had at one time
   been our old acquaintance arthur wheeler

   some instinct sent us staggering and crawling out of the cave and down
   the tangled slope to a point whence we could not see the ominous stone
   dog we hardly knew what to think for our brains were churning with
   conjectures and apprehensions ben who had known wheeler well was
   especially upset; and seemed to be piecing together some threads i had
   overlooked

   again and again as we paused on the green slope he repeated poor
   arthur poor arthur! but not till he muttered the name mad dan did i
   recall the trouble into which according to old sam poole wheeler had
   run just before his disappearance mad dan ben implied would
   doubtless be glad to see what had happened for a moment it flashed
   over both of us that the jealous host might have been responsible for
   the sculptors presence in this evil cave but the thought went as
   quickly as it came

   the thing that puzzled us most was to account for the phenomenon
   itself what gaseous emanation or mineral vapour could have wrought
   this change in so relatively short a time was utterly beyond us normal
   petrification we know is a slow chemical replacement process
   requiring vast ages for completion; yet here were two stone images
   which had been living thingsor at least wheeler hadonly a few weeks
   before conjecture was useless clearly nothing remained but to notify
   the authorities and let them guess what they might; and yet at the back
   of bens head that notion about mad dan still persisted anyhow we
   clawed our way back to the road but ben did not turn toward the
   village but looked along upward toward where old sam had said dans
   cabin lay it was the second house from the village the ancient loafer
   had wheezed and lay on the left far back from the road in a thick
   copse of scrub oaks before i knew it ben was dragging me up the sandy
   highway past a dingy farmstead and into a region of increasing
   wildness

   it did not occur to me to protest but i felt a certain sense of
   mounting menace as the familiar marks of agriculture and civilisation
   grew fewer and fewer at last the beginning of a narrow neglected path
   opened up on our left while the peaked roof of a squalid unpainted
   building shewed itself beyond a sickly growth of halfdead trees this
   i knew must be mad dans cabin; and i wondered that wheeler had ever
   chosen so unprepossessing a place for his headquarters i dreaded to
   walk up that weedy uninviting path but could not lag behind when ben
   strode determinedly along and began a vigorous rapping at the rickety
   mustysmelling door

   there was no response to the knock and something in its echoes sent a
   series of shivers through one ben however was quite unperturbed; and
   at once began to circle the house in quest of unlocked windows the
   third that he triedin the rear of the dismal cabinproved capable of
   opening and after a boost and a vigorous spring he was safely inside
   and helping me after him

   the room in which we landed was full of limestone and granite blocks
   chiselling tools and clay models and we realised at once that it was
   wheelers erstwhile studio so far we had not met with any sign of
   life but over everything hovered a damnably ominous dusty odour on
   our left was an open door evidently leading to a kitchen on the chimney
   side of the house and through this ben started intent on finding
   anything he could concerning his friends last habitat he was
   considerably ahead of me when he crossed the threshold so that i could
   not see at first what brought him up short and wrung a low cry of
   horror from his lips

   in another moment though i did seeand repeated his cry as
   instinctively as i had done in the cave for here in this cabinfar
   from any subterranean depths which could breed strange gases and work
   strange mutationswere two stony figures which i knew at once were no
   products of arthur wheelers chisel in a rude armchair before the
   fireplace bound in position by the lash of a long rawhide whip was
   the form of a manunkempt elderly and with a look of fathomless
   horror on its evil petrified face

   on the floor beside it lay a womans figure; graceful and with a face
   betokening considerable youth and beauty its expression seemed to be
   one of sardonic satisfaction and near its outflung right hand was a
   large tin pail somewhat stained on the inside as with a darkish
   sediment

   we made no move to approach those inexplicably petrified bodies nor
   did we exchange any but the simplest conjectures that this stony
   couple had been mad dan and his wife we could not well doubt but how
   to account for their present condition was another matter as we looked
   horrifiedly around we saw the suddenness with which the final
   development must have comefor everything about us seemed despite a
   heavy coating of dust to have been left in the midst of commonplace
   household activities

   the only exception to this rule of casualness was on the kitchen table;
   in whose cleared centre as if to attract attention lay a thin
   battered blankbook weighted down by a sizeable tin funnel crossing
   to read the thing ben saw that it was a kind of diary or set of dated
   entries written in a somewhat cramped and none too practiced hand the
   very first words riveted my attention and before ten seconds had
   elapsed he was breathlessly devouring the halting texti avidly
   following as i peered over his shoulder as we read onmoving as we
   did so into the less loathsome atmosphere of the adjoining roommany
   obscure things became terribly clear to us and we trembled with a
   mixture of complex emotions

   this is what we readand what the coroner read later on the public
   has seen a highly twisted and sensationalised version in the cheap
   newspapers but not even that has more than a fraction of the genuine
   terror which the simple original held for us as we puzzled it out alone
   in that musty cabin among the wild hills with two monstrous stone
   abnormalities lurking in the deathlike silence of the next room when
   we had finished ben pocketed the book with a gesture half of repulsion
   and his first words were lets get out of here silently and
   nervously we stumbled to the front of the house unlocked the door and
   began the long tramp back to the village there were many statements to
   make and questions to answer in the days that followed and i do not
   think that either ben or i can ever shake off the effects of the whole
   harrowing experience neither can some of the local authorities and
   city reporters who flocked aroundeven though they burned a certain
   book and many papers found in attic boxes and destroyed considerable
   apparatus in the deepest part of that sinister hillside cave but here
   is the text itself:

   nov 5my name is daniel morris around here they call me `mad dan
   because i believe in powers that nobody else believes in nowadays when
   i go up on thunder hill to keep the feast of the foxes they think i am
   crazyall except the back country folks that are afraid of me they
   try to stop me from sacrificing the black goat at hallow eve and
   always prevent my doing the great rite that would open the gate they
   ought to know better for they know i am a van kauran on my mothers
   side and anybody this side of the hudson can tell what the van kaurans
   have handed down we come from nicholas van kauran the wizard who was
   hanged in wijtgaart in 1587 and everybody knows he had made the
   bargain with the black man

   the soldiers never got his book of eibon when they burned his house
   and his grandson william van kauran brought it over when he came to
   rensselaerwyck and later crossed the river to esopus ask anybody in
   kingston or hurley about what the william van kauran line could do to
   people that got in their way also ask them if my uncle hendrik didnt
   manage to keep hold of the book of eibon when they ran him out of town
   and he went up the river to this place with his family

   i am writing thisand am going to keep writing thisbecause i want
   people to know the truth after i am gone also i am afraid i shall
   really go mad if i dont set things down in plain black and white
   everything is going against me and if it keeps up i shall have to use
   the secrets in the book and call in certain powers three months ago
   that sculptor arthur wheeler came to mountain top and they sent him up
   to me because i am the only man in the place who knows anything except
   farming hunting and fleecing summer boarders the fellow seemed to be
   interested in what i had to say and made a deal to stop here for
   $1300 a week with meals i gave him the back room beside the kitchen
   for his lumps of stone and his chiselling and arranged with nate
   williams to tend to his rock blasting and haul his big pieces with a
   drag and yoke of oxen

   that was three months ago now i know why that cursed son of hell took
   so quick to the place it wasnt my talk at all but the looks of my
   wife rose that is osborne chandlers oldest girl she is sixteen years
   younger than i am and is always casting sheeps eyes at the fellows in
   town but we always managed to get along fine enough till this dirty
   rat shewed up even if she did balk at helping me with the rites on
   roodmas and hallowmass i can see now that wheeler is working on her
   feelings and getting her so fond of him that she hardly looks at me
   and i suppose hell try to elope with her sooner or later

   but he works slow like all sly polished dogs and ive got plenty of
   time to think up what to do about it they dont either of them know i
   suspect anything but before long theyll both realise it doesnt pay
   to break up a van kaurans home i promise them plenty of novelty in
   what ill do

   nov 25thanksgiving day! thats a pretty good joke! but at that ill
   have something to be thankful for when i finish what ive started no
   question but that wheeler is trying to steal my wife for the time
   being though ill let him keep on being a star boarder got the book
   of eibon down from uncle hendriks old trunk in the attic last week
   and am looking up something good which wont require sacrifices that i
   cant make around here i want something thatll finish these two
   sneaking traitors and at the same time get me into no trouble if it
   has a twist of drama in it so much the better ive thought of calling
   in the emanation of yoth but that needs a childs blood and i must be
   careful about the neighbours the green decay looks promising but that
   would be a bit unpleasant for me as well as for them i dont like
   certain sights and smells

   dec 10eureka! ive got the very thing at last! revenge is
   sweetand this is the perfect climax! wheeler the sculptorthis is
   too good! yes indeed that damned sneak is going to produce a statue
   that will sell quicker than any of the things hes been carving these
   past weeks! a realist eh? wellthe new statuary wont lack any
   realism! i found the formula in a manuscript insert opposite page 679
   of the book from the handwriting i judge it was put there by my
   greatgrandfather bareut picterse van kauranthe one who disappeared
   from new paltz in 1839 i?! shubniggurath! the goat with a thousand
   young!

   to be plain ive found a way to turn those wretched rats into stone
   statues its absurdly simple and really depends more on plain
   chemistry than on the outer powers if i can get hold of the right
   stuff i can brew a drink thatll pass for homemade wine and one swig
   ought to finish any ordinary being short of an elephant what it
   amounts to is a kind of petrification infinitely speeded up shoots the
   whole system full of calcium and barium salts and replaces living cells
   with mineral matter so fast that nothing can stop it it must have been
   one of those things greatgrandfather got at the great sabbat on
   sugarloaf in the catskills queer things used to go on there seems to
   me i heard of a man in new paltzsquire hasbrouckturned to stone or
   something like that in 1834 he was an enemy of the van kaurans first
   thing i must do is order the five chemicals i need from albany and
   montreal plenty of time later to experiment when everything is over
   ill round up all the statues and sell them as wheelers work to pay
   for his overdue board bill! he always was a realist and an
   egoistwouldnt it be natural for him to make a selfportrait in
   stone and to use my wife for another modelas indeed hes really been
   doing for the past fortnight? trust the dull public not to ask what
   quarry the queer stone came from!

   dec 25christmas peace on earth and so forth! these two swine are
   goggling at each other as if i didnt exist they must think im deaf
   dumb and blind! well the barium sulphate and calcium chloride came
   from albany last thursday and the acids catalytics and instruments
   are due from montreal any day now the mills of the godsand all that!
   ill do the work in allens cave near the lower wood lot and at the
   same time will be openly making some wine in the cellar here there
   ought to be some excuse for offering a new drinkthough it wont take
   much planning to fool those moonstruck nincompoops the trouble will be
   to make rose take wine for she pretends not to like it any
   experiments that i make on animals will be down at the cave and nobody
   ever thinks of going there in winter ill do some woodcutting to
   account for my time away a small load or two brought in will keep him
   off the track

   jan 20its harder work than i thought a lot depends on the exact
   proportions the stuff came from montreal but i had to send again for
   some better scales and an acetylene lamp theyre getting curious down
   at the village wish the express office werent in steenwycks store
   am trying various mixtures on the sparrows that drink and bathe in the
   pool in front of the cavewhen its melted sometimes it kills them
   but sometimes they fly away clearly ive missed some important
   reaction i suppose rose and that upstart are making the most of my
   absencebut i can afford to let them there can be no doubt of my
   success in the end

   feb 11have got it at last! put a fresh lot in the little
   poolwhich is well melted todayand the first bird that drank toppled
   over as if he were shot i picked him up a second later and he was a
   perfect piece of stone down to the smallest claws and feather not a
   muscle changed since he was poised for drinking so he must have died
   the instant any of the stuff got to his stomach i didnt expect the
   petrification to come so soon but a sparrow isnt a fair test of the
   way the thing would act with a large animal i must get something
   bigger to try it on for it must be the right strength when i give it
   to those swine i guess roses dog rex will do ill take him along the
   next time and say a timber wolf got him she thinks a lot of him and i
   shant be sorry to give her something to sniffle over before the big
   reckoning i must be careful where i keep this book rose sometimes
   pries around in the queerest places

   feb 15getting warm! tried it on rex and it worked like a charm with
   only double the strength i fixed the rock pool and got him to drink
   he seemed to know something queer had hit him for he bristled and
   growled but he was a piece of stone before he could turn his head the
   solution ought to have been stronger and for a human being ought to be
   very much stronger i think im getting the hang of it now and am
   about ready for that cur wheeler the stuff seems to be tasteless but
   to make sure ill flavour it with the new wine im making up at the
   house wish i were surer about the tastelessness so i could give it to
   rose in water without trying to urge wine on her ill get the two
   separatelywheeler out here and rose at home have just fixed a strong
   solution and cleared away all strange objects in front of the cave
   rose whimpered like a puppy when i told her a wolf had got rex and
   wheeler gurgled a lot of sympathy march 1i? rlyeh! praise the lord
   tsathoggua! ive got the son of hell at last! told him id found a new
   ledge of friable limestone down this way and he trotted after me like
   the yellow cur he is! i had the wineflavoured stuff in a bottle on my
   hip and he was glad of a swig when we got here gulped it down without
   a winkand dropped in his tracks before you could count three but he
   knows ive had my vengeance for i made a face at him that he couldnt
   miss i saw the look of understanding come into his face as he keeled
   over in two minutes he was solid stone

   i dragged him into the cave and put rexs figure outside again that
   bristling dog shape will help to scare people off its getting time
   for the spring hunters and besides theres a damned `lunger named
   jackson in a cabin over the hill who does a lot of snooping around in
   the snow i wouldnt want my laboratory and storeroom to be found just
   yet! when i got home i told rose that wheeler had found a telegram at
   the village summoning him suddenly home i dont know whether she
   believed me or not but it doesnt matter for forms sake i packed
   wheelers things and took them down the hill telling her i was going
   to ship them after him i put them in the dry well at the abandoned
   rapelye place now for rose!

   march 3cant get rose to drink any wine i hope that stuff is
   tasteless enough to go unnoticed in water i tried it in tea and
   coffee but it forms a precipitate and cant be used that way if i use
   it in water ill have to cut down the dose and trust to a more gradual
   action mr and mrs hoog dropped in this noon and i had hard work
   keeping the conversation away from wheelers departure it mustnt get
   around that we say he was called back to new york when everybody at the
   village knows no telegram came and that he didnt leave on the bus
   rose is acting damned queer about the whole thing ill have to pick a
   quarrel with her and keep her locked in the attic the best way is to
   try to make her drink that doctored wineand if she does give in so
   much better

   march 7have started in on rose she wouldnt drink the wine so i
   took a whip to her and drove her up in the attic shell never come
   down alive i pass her a platter of salty bread and salt meat and a
   pail of slightly doctored water twice a day the salt food ought to
   make her drink a lot and it cant be long before the action sets in i
   dont like the way she shouts about wheeler when im at the door the
   rest of the time she is absolutely silent

   march 9its damned peculiar how slow that stuff is in getting hold
   of rose ill have to make it strongerprobably shell never taste it
   with all the salt ive been feeding her well if it doesnt get her
   there are plenty of other ways to fall back on but i would like to
   carry this neat statue plan through! went to the cave this morning and
   all is well there i sometimes hear roses steps on the ceiling
   overhead and i think theyre getting more and more dragging the stuff
   is certainly working but its too slow not strong enough from now on
   ill rapidly stiffen up the dose

   march 11it is very queer she is still alive and moving tuesday
   night i heard her piggling with a window so went up and gave her a
   rawhiding she acts more sullen than frightened and her eyes look
   swollen but she could never drop to the ground from that height and
   theres nowhere she could climb down i have had dreams at night for
   her slow dragging pacing on the floor above gets on my nerves
   sometimes i think she works at the lock on the door

   march 15still alive despite all the strengthening of the dose
   theres something queer about it she crawls now and doesnt pace very
   often but the sound of her crawling is horrible she rattles the
   windows too and fumbles with the door i shall have to finish her off
   with the rawhide if this keeps up im getting very sleepy wonder if
   rose has got on her guard somehow but she must be drinking the stuff
   this sleepiness is abnormali think the strain is telling on me im
   sleepy

   march 164 amthis is added by rose c morris about to die
   please notify my father osborne e chandler route 2 mountain top
   ny i have just read what the beast has written i felt sure he had
   killed arthur wheeler but did not know how till i read this terrible
   notebook now i know what i escaped i noticed the water tasted queer
   so took none of it after the first sip i threw it all out of the
   window that one sip has half paralysed me but i can still get about
   the thirst was terrible but i ate as little as possible of the salty
   food and was able to get a little water by setting some old pans and
   dishes that were up here under places where the roof leaked there
   were two great rains i thought he was trying to poison me though i
   didnt know what the poison was like what he has written about himself
   and me is a lie we were never happy together and i think i married him
   only under one of those spells that he was able to lay on people i
   guess he hypnotised both my father and me for he was always hated and
   feared and suspected of dark dealings with the devil my father once
   called him the devils kin and he was right

   no one will ever know what i went through as his wife it was not
   simply common crueltythough god knows he was cruel enough and beat
   me often with a leather whip it was moremore than anyone in this age
   can ever understand he was a monstrous creature and practiced all
   sorts of hellish ceremonies handed down by his mothers people he
   tried to make me help in the ritesand i dont dare even hint what
   they were i would not so he beat me it would be blasphemy to tell
   what he tried to make me do i can say he was a murderer even then for
   i know what he sacrificed one night on thunder hill he was surely the
   devils kin i tried four times to run away but he always caught and
   beat me also he had a sort of hold over my mind and even over my
   fathers mind

   about arthur wheeler i have nothing to be ashamed of we did come to
   love each other but only in an honourable way he gave me the first
   kind treatment i had ever had since leaving my fathers and meant to
   help me get out of the clutches of that fiend he had several talks
   with my father and was going to help me get out west after my divorce
   we would have been married

   ever since that brute locked me in the attic i have planned to get out
   and finish him i always kept the poison overnight in case i could
   escape and find him asleep and give it to him somehow at first he
   waked easily when i worked on the lock of the door and tested the
   conditions at the windows but later he began to get more tired and
   sleep sounder i could always tell by his snoring when he was asleep

   tonight he was so fast asleep i forced the lock without waking him it
   was hard work getting downstairs with my partial paralysis but i did
   i found him here with the lamp burningasleep at the table where he
   had been writing in this book in the corner was the long rawhide whip
   he had so often beaten me with i used it to tie him to the chair so he
   could not move a muscle i lashed his neck so that i could pour
   anything down his throat without his resisting

   he waked up just as i was finishing and i guess he saw right off that
   he was done for he shouted frightful things and tried to chant
   mystical formulas but i choked him off with a dish towel from the
   sink then i saw this book he had been writing in and stopped to read
   it the shock was terrible and i almost fainted four or five times my
   mind was not ready for such things after that i talked to that fiend
   for two or three hours steady i told him everything i had wanted to
   tell him through all the years i had been his slave and a lot of other
   things that had to do with what i had read in this awful book

   he looked almost purple when i was through and i think he was half
   delirious then i got a funnel from the cupboard and jammed it into his
   mouth after taking out the gag he knew what i was going to do but was
   helpless i had brought down the pail of poisoned water and without a
   qualm i poured a good half of it into the funnel

   it must have been a very strong dose for almost at once i saw that
   brute begin to stiffen and turn a dull stony grey in ten minutes i
   knew he was solid stone i could not bear to touch him but the tin
   funnel clinked horribly when i pulled it out of his mouth i wish i
   could have given that kin of the devil a more painful lingering death
   but surely this was the most appropriate he could have had there is
   not much more to say i am halfparalysed and with arthur murdered i
   have nothing to live for i shall make things complete by drinking the
   rest of the poison after placing this book where it will be found in a
   quarter of an hour i shall be a stone statue my only wish is to be
   buried beside the statue that was arthurwhen it is found in that cave
   where the fiend left it poor trusting rex ought to lie at our feet i
   do not care what becomes of the stone devil tied in the chair

   the messenger
   by h p lovecraft
   12311the messengerh p lovecraft

   the thing he said would come in the night at three
   from the old churchyard on the hill below;
   but crouching by an oak fires wholesome glow
   i tried to tell myself it could not be

   surely i mused it was pleasantry
   devised by one who did not truly know
   the elder sign bequeathed from long ago
   that sets the fumbling forms of darkness free

   he had not meant it  no  but still i lit
   another lamp as starry leo climbed
   out of the seekonk and a steeple chimed
   three  and the firelight faded bit by bit

   then at the door that cautious rattling came 
   and the mad truth devoured me like a flame!

   the moon bog
   by h p lovecraft
   14847the moon bogh p lovecraft

   somewhere to what remote and fearsome region i know not denys barry
   has gone i was with him the last night he lived among men and heard
   his screams when the thing came to him; but all the peasants and police
   in county meath could never find him or the others though they
   searched long and far and now i shudder when i hear the frogs piping
   in swamps or see the moon in lonely places

   i had known denys barry well in america where he had grown rich and
   had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at
   sleepy kilderry it was from kilderry that his father had come and it
   was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes
   men of his blood had once ruled over kilderry and built and dwelt in
   the castle but those days were very remote so that for generations
   the castle had been empty and decaying after he went to ireland barry
   wrote me often and told me how under his care the gray castle was
   rising tower by tower to its ancient splendor how the ivy was climbing
   slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago
   and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with
   his gold from over the sea but in time there came troubles and the
   peasants ceased to bless him and fled away instead as from a doom and
   then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him for he was lonely in
   the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and laborers
   he had brought from the north

   the bog was the cause of all these troubles as barry told me the night
   i came to the castle i had reached kilderry in the summer sunset as
   the gold of the sky lighted the green of the hills and groves and the
   blue of the bog where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened
   spectrally that sunset was very beautiful but the peasants at
   ballylough had warned me against it and said that kilderry had become
   accursed so that i almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the
   castle gilded with fire barrys motor had met me at the ballylough
   station for kilderry is off the railway the villagers had shunned the
   car and the driver from the north but had whispered to me with pale
   faces when they saw i was going to kilderry and that night after our
   reunion barry told me why

   the peasants had gone from kilderry because denys barry was to drain
   the great bog for all his love of ireland america had not left him
   untouched and he hated the beautiful wasted space where peat might be
   cut and land opened up the legends and superstitions of kilderry did
   not move him and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help
   and then cursed him and went away to ballylough with their few
   belongings as they saw his determination in their place he sent for
   laborers from the north and when the servants left he replaced them
   likewise but it was lonely among strangers so barry had asked me to
   come

   when i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry i
   laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed for these fears were of the
   vaguest wildest and most absurd character they had to do with some
   preposterous legend of the bog and a grim guardian spirit that dwelt
   in the strange olden ruin on the far islet i had seen in the sunset
   there were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon and of
   chill winds when the night was warm; of wraiths in white hovering over
   the waters and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy
   surface but foremost among the weird fancies and alone in its
   absolute unanimity was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare
   to touch or drain the vast reddish morass there were secrets said the
   peasants which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden
   since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous
   years beyond history in the book of invaders it is told that these
   sons of the greeks were all buried at tallaght but old men in kilderry
   said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moongoddess; so
   that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of nemed swept down
   from scythia in their thirty ships

   such were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave kilderry
   and when i heard them i did not wonder that denys barry had refused to
   listen he had however a great interest in antiquities and proposed
   to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained the white ruins on
   the islet he had often visited but though their age was plainly great
   and their contour very little like that of most ruins in ireland they
   were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory now the work of
   drainage was ready to begin and the laborers from the north were soon
   to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather and kill
   the tiny shellpaved streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with
   rushes

   after barry had told me these things i was very drowsy for the travels
   of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the
   night a manservant showed me to my room which was in a remote tower
   overlooking the village and the plain at the edge of the bog and the
   bog itself; so that i could see from my windows in the moonlight the
   silent roofs from which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered
   the laborers from the north and too the parish church with its
   antique spire and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden
   ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral just as i dropped to
   sleep i fancied i heard faint sounds from the distance; sounds that
   were wild and half musical and stirred me with a weird excitement
   which colored my dreams but when i awaked next morning i felt it had
   all been a dream for the visions i had seen were more wonderful than
   any sound of wild pipes in the night influenced by the legends that
   barry had related my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city
   in a green valley where marble streets and statues villas and
   temples carvings and inscriptions all spoke in certain tones the
   glory that was greece when i told this dream to barry we had both
   laughed; but i laughed the louder because he was perplexed about his
   laborers from the north for the sixth time they had all overslept
   waking very slowly and dazedly and acting as if they had not rested
   although they were known to have gone early to bed the night before

   that morning and afternoon i wandered alone through the sungilded
   village and talked now and then with idle laborers for barry was busy
   with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage the laborers
   were not as happy as they might have been for most of them seemed
   uneasy over some dream which they had had yet which they tried in vain
   to remember i told them of my dream but they were not interested till
   i spoke of the weird sounds i thought i had heard then they looked
   oddly at me and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds too

   in the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin
   the drainage in two days i was glad for although i disliked to see
   the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart i had
   a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deepmatted peat
   might hide and that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble
   peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in
   the valley i saw a pestilence descend and then a frightful avalanche
   of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left
   unburied only the temple of artemis on the high peak where the aged
   moonpriestess cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her
   silver head

   i have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm for some time i could
   not tell whether i was waking or sleeping for the sound of flutes
   still rang shrilly in my ears; but when i saw on the floor the icy
   moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed gothic window i decided i
   must be awake and in the castle of kilderry then i heard a clock from
   some remote landing below strike the hour of two and knew i was awake
   yet still there came that monstrous piping from afar; wild weird airs
   that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant maenalus it would
   not let me sleep and in impatience i sprang up and paced the floor
   only by chance did i go to the north window and look out upon the
   silent village and the plain at the edge of the bog i had no wish to
   gaze abroad for i wanted to sleep; but the flutes tormented me and i
   had to do or see something how could i have suspected the thing i was
   to behold?

   there in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle
   which no mortal having seen it could ever forget to the sound of
   reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there glided silently and eerily a
   mixed throng of swaying figures reeling through such a revel as the
   sicilians may have danced to demeter in the old days under the harvest
   moon beside the cyane the wide plain the golden moonlight the
   shadowy moving forms and above all the shrill monotonous piping
   produced an effect which almost paralyzed me; yet i noted amidst my
   fear that half of these tireless mechanical dancers were the laborers
   whom i had thought asleep whilst the other half were strange airy
   beings in white halfindeterminate in nature but suggesting pale
   wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog i do not know how
   long i gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before i
   dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon out of which the high sun of
   morning aroused me

   my first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and
   observations to denys barry but as i saw the sunlight glowing through
   the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in
   what i thought i had seen i am given to strange fantasms yet am never
   weak enough to believe in them; so on this occasion contented myself
   with questioning the laborers who slept very late and recalled nothing
   of the previous night save misty dreams of shrill sounds this matter
   of the spectral piping harassed me greatly and i wondered if the
   crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and
   haunt the visions of men later in the day i watched barry in the
   library poring over his plans for the great work which was to begin on
   the morrow and for the first time felt a touch of the same kind of
   fear that had driven the peasants away for some unknown reason i
   dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless
   secrets and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured
   depth of ageold peat that these secrets should be brought to light
   seemed injudicious and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the
   castle and the village i went so far as to talk casually to barry on
   the subject but did not dare continue after he gave his resounding
   laugh so i was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills
   and kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portent

   whether the events of that night were of reality or illusion i shall
   never ascertain certainly they transcend anything we dream of in
   nature and the universe; yet in no normal fashion can i explain those
   disappearances which were known to all men after it was over i retired
   early and full of dread and for a long time could not sleep in the
   uncanny silence of the tower it was very dark for although the sky
   was clear the moon was now well in the wane and would not rise till
   the small hours i thought as i lay there of denys barry and of what
   would befall that bog when the day came and found myself almost
   frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night take barrys car
   and drive madly to ballylough out of the menaced lands but before my
   fears could crystallize into action i had fallen asleep and gazed in
   dreams upon the city in the valley cold and dead under a shroud of
   hideous shadow

   probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me yet that piping was
   not what i noticed first when i opened my eyes i was lying with my
   back to the east window overlooking the bog where the waning moon
   would rise and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite
   wall before me; but i had not looked for such a sight as now appeared
   light indeed glowed on the panels ahead but it was not any light that
   the moon gives terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence
   that streamed through the gothic window and the whole chamber was
   brilliant with a splendor intense and unearthly my immediate actions
   were peculiar for such a situation but it is only in tales that a man
   does the dramatic and foreseen thing instead of looking out across the
   bog toward the source of the new light i kept my eyes from the window
   in panic fear and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of
   escape i remember seizing my revolver and hat but before it was over
   i had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other after
   a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright and i
   crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening incessant
   piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the
   village

   over the bog was a deluge of flaring light scarlet and sinister and
   pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet the aspect of
   that ruin i can not describe  i must have been mad for it seemed to
   rise majestic and undecayed splendid and columncinctured the
   flamereflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the
   apex of a temple on a mountaintop flutes shrieked and drums began to
   beat and as i watched in awe and terror i thought i saw dark saltant
   forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and
   effulgence the effect was titanic  altogether unthinkable  and i
   might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed
   to grow stronger at my left trembling with a terror oddly mixed with
   ecstasy i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i
   could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog there my
   eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if i had not just
   turned from a scene beyond the pale of nature for on the ghastly
   redlitten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as
   none ever saw before save in nightmares

   half gliding half floating in the air the whiteclad bogwraiths were
   slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in
   fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial
   dance their waving translucent arms guided by the detestable piping
   of those unseen flutes beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of
   lurching laborers who followed doglike with blind brainless
   floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless demonwill
   as the naiads neared the bog without altering their course a new line
   of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some
   door far below my window groped sightiessly across the courtyard and
   through the intervening bit of village and joined the floundering
   column of laborers on the plain despite their distance below me i at
   once knew they were the servants brought from the north for i
   recognized the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook whose very
   absurdness had now become unutterably tragic the flutes piped
   horribly and again i heard the beating of the drums from the direction
   of the island ruin then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the
   water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of
   followers never checking their speed splashed awkwardly after them
   and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which i could
   barely see in the scarlet light and as the last pathetic straggler
   the fat cook sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool the flutes
   and the drums grew silent and the blinding red rays from the ruins
   snapped instantaneously out leaving the village of doom lone and
   desolate in the wan beams of a newrisen moon

   my condition was now one of indescribable chaos not knowing whether i
   was mad or sane sleeping or waking i was saved only by a merciful
   numbness i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to
   artemis latona demeter persephone and plouton all that i recalled
   of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation
   roused my deepest superstitions i felt that i had witnessed the death
   of a whole village and knew i was alone in the castle with denys
   barry whose boldness had brought down a doom as i thought of him new
   terrors convulsed me and i fell to the floor; not fainting but
   physically helpless then i felt the icy blast from the east window
   where the moon had risen and began to hear the shrieks in the castle
   far below me soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality
   which can not be written of and which makes me faint as i think of
   them all i can say is that they came from something i had known as a
   friend

   at some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the
   screaming must have roused me for my next impression is of racing
   madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard
   into the hideous night they found me at dawn wandering mindless near
   ballylough but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors i
   had seen or heard before what i muttered about as i came slowly out of
   the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my
   flight: incidents of no significance yet which haunt me unceasingly
   when i am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight

   as i fled from that accursed castle along the bogs edge i heard a new
   sound: common yet unlike any i had heard before at kilderry the
   stagnant waters lately quite devoid of animal life now teemed with a
   horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in
   tones strangely out of keeping with their size they glistened bloated
   and green in the moonbeams and seemed to gaze up at the fount of
   light i followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog and saw the
   second of the things which drove my senses away

   stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the
   waning moon my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance
   having no reflection in the waters of the bog and upward along that
   pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing; a
   vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen demons crazed
   as i was i saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance  a
   nauseous unbelievable caricature  a blasphemous effigy of him who had
   been denys barry

   8517the music of erich zannh p lovecraft

   i have examined maps of the city with the greatest care yet have never
   again found the rue dauseil these maps have not been modern maps
   alone for i know that names change i have on the contrary delved
   deeply into all the antiquities of the place and have personally
   explored every region of whatever name which could possibly answer to
   the street i knew as the rue dauseil but despite all i have done it
   remains an humiliating fact that i cannot find the house the street
   or even the locality where during the last months of my impoverished
   life as a student of metaphysics at the university i heard the music
   of erich zann

   that my memory is broken i do not wonder; for my health physical and
   mental was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in
   the rue dauseil and i recall that i took none of my few acquaintances
   there but that i cannot find the place again is both singular and
   perplexing; for it was within a halfhours walk of the university and
   was distinguished by peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by
   any one who had been there i have never met a person who has seen the
   rue dauseil

   the rue dauseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick
   blearwindowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark
   stone it was always shadowy along that river as if the smoke of
   neighboring factories shut out the sun perpetually the river was also
   odorous with evil stenches which i have never smelled elsewhere and
   which may some day help me to find it since i should recognize them at
   once beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets with rails; and
   then came the ascent at first gradual but incredibly steep as the rue
   dauseil was reached

   i have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the rue
   dauseil it was almost a cliff closed to all vehicles consisting in
   several places of flights of steps and ending at the top in a lofty
   ivied wall its paving was irregular sometimes stone slabs sometimes
   cobblestones and sometimes bare earth with struggling greenishgrey
   vegetation the houses were tall peakedroofed incredibly old and
   crazily leaning backward forward and sidewise occasionally an
   opposite pair both leaning forward almost met across the street like
   an arch; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground
   below there were a few overhead bridges from house to house across the
   street

   the inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly; at first i
   thought it was because they were all silent and reticent; but later
   decided it was because they were all very old i do not know how i came
   to live on such a street but i was not myself when i moved there i
   had been living in many poor places always evicted for want of money;
   until at last i came upon that tottering house in the rue dauseil kept
   by the paralytic blandot it was the third house from the top of the
   street and by far the tallest of them all

   my room was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there since
   the house was almost empty on the night i arrived i heard strange
   music from the peaked garret overhead and the next day asked old
   blandot about it he told me it was an old german violplayer a
   strange dumb man who signed his name as erich zann and who played
   evenings in a cheap theater orchestra; adding that zanns desire to
   play in the night after his return from the theater was the reason he
   had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room whose single gable
   window was the only point on the street from which one could look over
   the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond

   thereafter i heard zann every night and although he kept me awake i
   was haunted by the weirdness of his music knowing little of the art
   myself i was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation
   to music i had heard before; and concluded that he was a composer of
   highly original genius the longer i listened the more i was
   fascinated until after a week i resolved to make the old mans
   acquaintance

   one night as he was returning from his work i intercepted zann in the
   hallway and told him that i would like to know him and be with him when
   he played he was a small lean bent person with shabby clothes blue
   eyes grotesque satyrlike face and nearly bald head; and at my first
   words seemed both angered and frightened my obvious friendliness
   however finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow
   him up the dark creaking and rickety attic stairs his room one of
   only two in the steeply pitched garret was on the west side toward
   the high wall that formed the upper end of the street its size was
   very great and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary
   barrenness and neglect of furniture there was only a narrow iron
   bedstead a dingy washstand a small table a large bookcase an iron
   musicrack and three oldfashioned chairs sheets of music were piled
   in disorder about the floor the walls were of bare boards and had
   probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs
   made the place seem more deserted than inhabited evidently erich
   zanns world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination

   motioning me to sit down the dumb man closed the door turned the
   large wooden bolt and lighted a candle to augment the one he had
   brought with him he now removed his viol from its motheaten covering
   and taking it seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs
   he did not employ the musicrack but offering no choice and playing
   from memory enchanted me for over an hour with strains i had never
   heard before; strains which must have been of his own devising to
   describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music
   they were a kind of fugue with recurrent passages of the most
   captivating quality but to me were notable for the absence of any of
   the weird notes i had overheard from my room below on other occasions

   those haunting notes i had remembered and had often hummed and
   whistled inaccurately to myself so when the player at length laid down
   his bow i asked him if he would render some of them as i began my
   request the wrinkled satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had
   possessed during the playing and seemed to show the same curious
   mixture of anger and fright which i had noticed when first i accosted
   the old man for a moment i was inclined to use persuasion regarding
   rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my
   hosts weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which i had
   listened the night before but i did not pursue this course for more
   than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognized the whistled air
   his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond
   analysis and his long cold bony right hand reached out to stop my
   mouth and silence the crude imitation as he did this he further
   demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the
   lone curtained window as if fearful of some intrudera glance doubly
   absurd since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the
   adjacent roofs this window being the only point on the steep street
   as the concierge had told me from which one could see over the wall at
   the summit

   the old mans glance brought blandots remark to my mind and with a
   certain capriciousness i felt a wish to look out over the wide and
   dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop
   which of all the dwellers in the rue dauseil only this crabbed
   musician could see i moved toward the window and would have drawn
   aside the nondescript curtains when with a frightened rage even
   greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time
   motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag
   me thither with both hands now thoroughly disgusted with my host i
   ordered him to release me and told him i would go at once his clutch
   relaxed and as he saw my disgust and offense his own anger seemed to
   subside he tightened his relaxing grip but this time in a friendly
   manner forcing me into a chair; then with an appearance of wistfulness
   crossing to the littered table where he wrote many words with a
   pencil in the labored french of a foreigner

   the note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and
   forgiveness zann said that he was old lonely and afflicted with
   strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with
   other things he had enjoyed my listening to his music and wished i
   would come again and not mind his eccentricities but he could not play
   to another his weird harmonies and could not bear hearing them from
   another; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by
   another he had not known until our hallway conversation that i could
   overhear his playing in my room and now asked me if i would arrange
   with blandot to take a lower room where i could not hear him in the
   night he would he wrote defray the difference in rent

   as i sat deciphering the execrable french i felt more lenient toward
   the old man he was a victim of physical and nervous suffering as was
   i; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness in the silence
   there came a slight sound from the windowthe shutter must have
   rattled in the night wind and for some reason i started almost as
   violently as did erich zann so when i had finished reading i shook my
   host by the hand and departed as a friend

   the next day blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor
   between the apartments of an aged moneylender and the room of a
   respectable upholsterer there was no one on the fourth floor

   it was not long before i found that zanns eagerness for my company was
   not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down
   from the fifth story he did not ask me to call on him and when i did
   call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly this was always at
   nightin the day he slept and would admit no one my liking for him
   did not grow though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold
   an odd fascination for me i had a curious desire to look out of that
   window over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs
   and spires which must lie outspread there once i went up to the garret
   during theater hours when zann was away but the door was locked

   what i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of
   the dumb old man at first i would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor
   then i grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the
   peaked garret there in the narrow hall outside the bolted door with
   the covered keyhole i often heard sounds which filled me with an
   indefinable dreadthe dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery it
   was not that the sounds were hideous for they were not; but that they
   held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth and that at
   certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which i could hardly
   conceive as produced by one player certainly erich zann was a genius
   of wild power as the weeks passed the playing grew wilder whilst the
   old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful
   to behold he now refused to admit me at any time and shunned me
   whenever we met on the stairs

   then one night as i listened at the door i heard the shrieking viol
   swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led
   me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that
   barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was realthe awful
   inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter and which rises only in
   moments of the most terrible fear or anguish i knocked repeatedly at
   the door but received no response afterward i waited in the black
   hallway shivering with cold and fear till i heard the poor musicians
   feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair believing
   him just conscious after a fainting fit i renewed my rapping at the
   same time calling out my name reassuringly i heard zann stumble to the
   window and close both shutter and sash then stumble to the door which
   he falteringly unfastened to admit me this time his delight at having
   me present was real; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while
   he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mothers skirts

   shaking pathetically the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank
   into another beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the
   floor he sat for some time inactive nodding oddly but having a
   paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening
   subsequently he seemed to be satisfied and crossing to a chair by the
   table wrote a brief note handed it to me and returned to the table
   where he began to write rapidly and incessantly the note implored me
   in the name of mercy and for the sake of my own curiosity to wait
   where i was while he prepared a full account in german of all the
   marvels and terrors which beset him i waited and the dumb mans
   pencil flew

   it was perhaps an hour later while i still waited and while the old
   musicians feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up that i
   saw zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock unmistakably he
   was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly then i
   half fancied i heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible
   sound but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical
   note suggesting a player in one of the neighboring houses or in some
   abode beyond the lofty wall over which i had never been able to look
   upon zann the effect was terrible for dropping his pencil suddenly
   he rose seized his viol and commenced to rend the night with the
   wildest playing i had ever heard from his bow save when listening at
   the barred door

   it would be useless to describe the playing of erich zann on that
   dreadful night it was more horrible than anything i had ever
   overheard because i could now see the expression of his face and
   could realize that this time the motive was stark fear he was trying
   to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something outwhat i
   could not imagine awesome though i felt it must be the playing grew
   fantastic delirious and hysterical yet kept to the last the
   qualities of supreme genius which i knew this strange old man
   possessed i recognized the airit was a wild hungarian dance popular
   in the theaters and i reflected for a moment that this was the first
   time i had ever heard zann play the work of another composer

   louder and louder wilder and wilder mounted the shrieking and whining
   of that desperate viol the player was dripping with an uncanny
   perspiration and twisted like a monkey always looking frantically at
   the curtained window in his frenzied strains i could almost see
   shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through
   seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning and then i thought
   i heard a shriller steadier note that was not from the viol; a calm
   deliberate purposeful mocking note from far away in the west

   at this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind
   which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within
   zanns screaming viol now outdid itself emitting sounds i had never
   thought a viol could emit the shutter rattled more loudly unfastened
   and commenced slamming against the window then the glass broke
   shiveringly under the persistent impacts and the chill wind rushed in
   making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the
   table where zann had begun to write out his horrible secret i looked
   at zann and saw that he was past conscious observation his blue eyes
   were bulging glassy and sightless and the frantic playing had become
   a blind mechanical unrecognizable orgy that no pen could even
   suggest

   a sudden gust stronger than the others caught up the manuscript and
   bore it toward the window i followed the flying sheets in desperation
   but they were gone before i reached the demolished panes then i
   remembered my old wish to gaze from this window the only window in the
   rue dauseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall and
   the city outspread beneath it was very dark but the citys lights
   always burned and i expected to see them there amidst the rain and
   wind yet when i looked from that highest of all gable windows looked
   while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the
   nightwind i saw no city spread below and no friendly lights gleamed
   from remembered streets but only the blackness of space illimitable;
   unimagined space alive with motion and music and having no semblance
   of anything on earth and as i stood there looking in terror the wind
   blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret leaving me in
   savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me
   and the demon madness of that nightbaying viol behind me

   i staggered back in the dark without the means of striking a light
   crashing against the table overturning a chair and finally groping my
   way to the place where the blackness screamed with shocking music to
   save myself and erich zann i could at least try whatever the powers
   opposed to me once i thought some chill thing brushed me and i
   screamed but my scream could not be heard above that hideous viol
   suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me and i
   knew i was close to the player i felt ahead touched the back of
   zanns chair and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to
   bring him to his senses

   he did not respond and still the viol shrieked on without slackening
   i moved my hand to his head whose mechanical nodding i was able to
   stop and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown
   things of the night but he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy
   of his unutterable music while all through the garret strange currents
   of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and babel when my hand touched
   his ear i shuddered though i knew not whyknew not why till i felt
   the still face; the icecold stiffened unbreathing face whose glassy
   eyes bulged uselessly into the void and then by some miracle finding
   the door and the large wooden bolt i plunged wildly away from that
   glassyeyed thing in the dark and from the ghoulish howling of that
   accursed viol whose fury increased even as i plunged

   leaping floating flying down those endless stairs through the dark
   house; racing mindlessly out into the narrow steep and ancient street
   of steps and tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles
   to the lower streets and the putrid canyonwalled river; panting across
   the great dark bridge to the broader healthier streets and boulevards
   we know; all these are terrible impressions that linger with me and i
   recall that there was no wind and that the moon was out and that all
   the lights of the city twinkled

   despite my most careful searches and investigations i have never since
   been able to find the rue dauseil but i am not wholly sorry; either
   for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closelywritten
   sheets which alone could have explained the music of erich zann

   [long version]

   by anonymus

   in the spring of 1847 the little village of ruralville was thrown into
   a state of excitement by the landing of a strange brig in the harbour
   it carried no flag and no name was painted on its side and everything
   about it was such as would excite suspicion it was from tripoli
   africa and the captain was named manuel ruello the excitement
   increased however; when john griggs (the magnate of the villiage)
   suddenly disappeared from his home this was the night of october
   4thon october 5th the brig left

   chapter ii

   it was 8 bells on the us frigate constitution when commander
   farragut sighted a strange brig to the westward it carried no flag
   and no name was painted on its side and everything about it was such
   as would excite suspicion on hailing it put up the pirates flag
   farragut ordered a gun fired and no sooner did he fire than the pirate
   ship gave them a broadside when the fight was over commander farragut
   missed one man named henry f johns

   chapter iii

   it was summer on the island of madagascar and natives were picking
   corn when one cried companions! i sight a ship! with no flag and with
   no name printed on the side and with everything about it such as would
   excite suspicion! and the natives fled in all directions when they
   came together on the other side of the island one was missing his name
   was dahabea

   chapter iv

   at length it was decided something must be done notes were compared
   three abductions were found to have taken place dissapearance of john
   griggs henry john & dahabea were recalled finally advertisements
   were issued offering £5000 reward for the capture of manuel ruello
   ship prisoners & crew when exciting news reached london! an unknown
   brig with no name was wrecked of the florida keys in america!

   chapter v

   the people hurried to florida and beheld a steel spindle shaped
   object lay placidly on the water beside the shattered wreck of the
   brig a submarine boat! shouted one yes! shouted another the
   mystery is cleared said a wise looking man in the excitement of the
   fight they launch the submarine boat and take as many as they wish
   unseen and john brown has disappeared! shouted a voice from
   the deck sure enough john brown was gone!

   chapter vi

   the finding of the submarine boat and the dissapearance of john brown
   caused renewed excitement among the people and a new discovery was
   made in relating this discovery it is necessary to relate a
   geographical fact: at the north pole there is supposed to exist a
   vast continent composed of volcanic soil a portion is open to
   travellers and explorers but it is barren and unfruitful and thus
   absolutely impassable it is called nomans land

   chapter vii

   in the extreme southern part of nomans land there was found a wharf
   and a hut &c and every sign of former human habitation a rusty
   doorplate was nailed to the hut inscribed in old english m ruello
   this then was the home of michael ruello the house brought to light
   a note book belonging to john griggs and the log of the constitution
   taken from henry johns and the madagascar reaper belong to dahabea

   chapter viii

   when about to leave they observed a spring on the side of the hut
   they pressed ita hole appeared in the side of the hut which they
   promptly entered they were in a subterranean cavern the beach ran
   down to the edge of a black murky sea on the sea lay a dark oblong
   objectviz another submarine boat which they entered there bound to
   the cabin floor lay griggs johns and dahabea all alive and well
   they when arriving in london separated griggs going to ruralville
   johns to the constitution and dahabea to madagascar

   chapter ix

   but the mystery of john brown lay still unsolved so they kept strict
   watch over the port at nomans land hoping the submarine boat would
   arrive at length however it did arrive bearing with it john brown
   they fixed upon the 5th of october for the attack they ranged along
   the shore and formed bodies finally one by one and headed by manuel
   ruello the pirates left the boat they were (to their astonishment) met
   by a rapid fire

   chapter x

   conclusion

   the pirates were at length defeated and a search was made for brown at
   length he (the aforesaid brown) was found john gregg was royally
   received at ruralville and a dinner was

   dahabea was made king of madagascar and manuel ruello was executed at
   newgate prison

   6474the nameless cityh p lovecraft

   when i drew nigh the nameless city i knew it was accursed i was
   traveling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon and afar i
   saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may
   protrude from an illmade grave fear spoke from the ageworn stones of
   this hoary survivor of the deluge this greatgrandfather of the eldest
   pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from
   antique and sinister secrets that no man should see and no man else
   had dared to see

   remote in the desert of araby lies the nameless city crumbling and
   inarticulate its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted
   ages it must have been thus before the first stones of memphis were
   laid and while the bricks of babylon were yet unbaked there is no
   legend so old as to give it a name or to recall that it was ever
   alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered
   about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it
   without wholly knowing why it was of this place that abdul alhazred
   the mad poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained
   couplet:

     that is not dead which can eternal lie
     and with strange aeons even death may die

   i should have known that the arabs had good reason for shunning the
   nameless city the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living
   man yet i defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel
   i alone have seen it and that is why no other face bears such hideous
   lines of fear as mine; why no other man shivers so horribly when the
   night wind rattles the windows when i came upon it in the ghastly
   stillness of unending sleep it looked at me chilly from the rays of a
   cold moon amidst the deserts heat and as i returned its look i forgot
   my triumph at finding it and stopped still with my camel to wait for
   the dawn

   for hours i waited till the east grew grey and the stars faded and
   the grey turned to roseate light edged with gold i heard a moaning and
   saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky
   was clear and the vast reaches of desert still then suddenly above the
   deserts far rim came the blazing edge of the sun seen through the
   tiny sandstorm which was passing away and in my fevered state i
   fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal
   to hail the fiery disc as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile
   my ears rang and my imagination seethed as i led my camel slowly across
   the sand to that unvocal place; that place which i alone of living men
   had seen

   in and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places i
   wandered finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men
   if men they were who built this city and dwelt therein so long ago
   the antiquity of the spot was unwholesome and i longed to encounter
   some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by
   mankind there were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins
   which i did not like i had with me many tools and dug much within the
   walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow and nothing
   significant was revealed when night and the moon returned i felt a
   chill wind which brought new fear so that i did not dare to remain in
   the city and as i went outside the antique walls to sleep a small
   sighing sandstorm gathered behind me blowing over the grey stones
   though the moon was bright and most of the desert still

   i awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams my ears
   ringing as from some metallic peal i saw the sun peering redly through
   the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless
   city and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape once more
   i ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand
   like an ogre under a coverlet and again dug vainly for relics of the
   forgotten race at noon i rested and in the afternoon i spent much
   time tracing the walls and bygone streets and the outlines of the
   nearly vanished buildings i saw that the city had been mighty indeed
   and wondered at the sources of its greatness to myself i pictured all
   the spendours of an age so distant that chaldaea could not recall it
   and thought of sarnath the doomed that stood in the land of mnar when
   mankind was young and of ib that was carven of grey stone before
   mankind existed

   all at once i came upon a place where the bed rock rose stark through
   the sand and formed a low cliff; and here i saw with joy what seemed to
   promise further traces of the antediluvian people hewn rudely on the
   face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small squat
   rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of
   ages too remote for calculation though sandstorms had long effaced any
   carvings which may have been outside

   very low and sandchoked were all the dark apertures near me but i
   cleared on with my spade and crawled through it carrying a torch to
   reveal whatever mysteries it might hold when i was inside i saw that
   the cavern was indeed a temple and beheld plain signs of the race that
   had lived and worshiped before the desert was a desert primitive
   altars pillars and niches all curiously low were not absent; and
   though i saw no sculptures or frescoes there were many singular stones
   clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means the lowness of the
   chiseled chamber was very strange for i could hardly kneel upright;
   but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a
   time i shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars
   and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible revolting and
   inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have
   made and frequented such a temple when i had seen all that the place
   contained i crawled out again avid to find what the temples might
   yield

   night had now approached yet the tangible things i had seen made
   curiosity stronger than fear so that i did not flee from the long
   mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first i saw the nameless
   city in the twilight i cleared another aperture and with a new torch
   crawled into it finding more vague stones and symbols though nothing
   more definite than the other temple had contained the room was just as
   low but much less broad ending in a very narrow passage crowded with
   obscure and cryptical shrines about these shrines i was prying when
   the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the stillness
   and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast

   the moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins lighting a
   dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind
   from some point along the cliff ahead of me i knew it was this chilly
   sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a
   place of better shelter when i chanced to glance up and saw that there
   was no wind atop the cliff this astonished me and made me fearful
   again but i immediately recalled the sudden local winds that i had
   seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset and judged it was a normal
   thing i decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave and
   watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving
   that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south
   of me almost out of sight against the choking sandcloud i plodded
   toward this temple which as i neared it loomed larger than the rest
   and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand i would have
   entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my
   torch it poured madly out of the dark door sighing uncannily as it
   ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins soon it grew fainter
   and the sand grew more and more still till finally all was at rest
   again; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the
   city and when i glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though
   mirrored in unquiet waters i was more afraid than i could explain but
   not enough to dull my thirst for wonder; so as soon as the wind was
   quite gone i crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come

   this temple as i had fancied from the outside was larger than either
   of those i had visited before; and was presumably a natural cavern
   since it bore winds from some region beyond here i could stand quite
   upright but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the
   other temples on the walls and roof i beheld for the first time some
   traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race curious curling
   streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away; and on two of
   the altars i saw with rising excitement a maze of wellfashioned
   curvilinear carvings as i held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the
   shape of the roof was too regular to be natural and i wondered what
   the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon their
   engineering skill must have been vast

   then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which i
   had been seeking the opening to those remoter abysses whence the
   sudden wind had blown; and i grew faint when i saw that it was a small
   and plainly artificial door chiseled in the solid rock i thrust my
   torch within beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a
   rough flight of very small numerous and steeply descending steps i
   shall always see those steps in my dreams for i came to learn what
   they meant at the time i hardly knew whether to call them steps or
   mere footholds in a precipitous descent my mind was whirling with mad
   thoughts and the words and warning of arab prophets seemed to float
   across the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that
   men dare not know yet i hesitated only for a moment before advancing
   through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep
   passage feet first as though on a ladder

   it is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any
   other man can have such a descent as mine the narrow passage led
   infinitely down like some hideous haunted well and the torch i held
   above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which i was
   crawling i lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch
   though i was frightened when i thought of the distance i must have been
   traversing there were changes of direction and of steepness; and once
   i came to a long low level passage where i had to wriggle my feet
   first along the rocky floor holding torch at arms length beyond my
   head the place was not high enough for kneeling after that were more
   of the steep steps and i was still scrambling down interminably when
   my failing torch died out i do not think i noticed it at the time for
   when i did notice it i was still holding it above me as if it were
   ablaze i was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and
   the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of
   far ancient and forbidden places

   in the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished
   treasury of daemonic lore; sentences from alhazred the mad arab
   paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of damascus and infamous
   lines from the delirious image du monde of gauthier de metz i repeated
   queer extracts and muttered of afrasiab and the daemons that floated
   with him down the oxus; later chanting over and over again a phrase
   from one of lord dunsanys talesthe unreveberate blackness of the
   abyss once when the descent grew amazingly steep i recited something
   in singsong from thomas moore until i feared to recite more:

     a reservoir of darkness black

     as witches cauldrons are when filld
     with moondrugs in th eclipse distilld
     leaning to look if foot might pass
     down thro that chasm i saw beneath
     as far as vision could explore
     the jetty sides as smooth as glass
     looking as if just varnishd oer
     with that dark pitch the seat of death
     throws out upon its slimy shore

   time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor
   and i found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two
   smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head i could not
   quite stand but could kneel upright and in the dark i shuffled and
   crept hither and thither at random i soon knew that i was in a narrow
   passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts
   as in that palaeozoic and abysmal place i felt of such things as
   polished wood and glass i shuddered at the possible implications the
   cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular
   intervals and were oblong and horizontal hideously like coffins in
   shape and size when i tried to move two or three for further
   examination i found that they were firmly fastened

   i saw that the passage was a long one so floundered ahead rapidly in a
   creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in
   the blackness; crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my
   surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched
   on man is so used to thinking visually that i almost forgot the
   darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its
   lowstudded monotony as though i saw it and then in a moment of
   indescribable emotion i did see it

   just when my fancy merged into real sight i cannot tell; but there came
   a gradual glow ahead and all at once i knew that i saw the dim
   outlines of a corridor and the cases revealed by some unknown
   subterranean phosphorescence for a little while all was exactly as i
   had imagined it since the glow was very faint; but as i mechanically
   kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light i realized that my fancy
   had been but feeble this hall was no relic of crudity like the temples
   in the city above but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic
   art rich vivid and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a
   continuous scheme of mural paintings whose lines and colours were
   beyond description the cases were of a strange golden wood with
   fronts of exquisite glass and containing the mummified forms of
   creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man

   to convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible they were of
   the reptile kind with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile
   sometimes the seal but more often nothing of which either the
   naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard in size they approximated
   a small man and their forelegs bore delicate and evident feet
   curiously like human hands and fingers but strangest of all were their
   heads which presented a contour violating all known biological
   principles to nothing can such things be well comparedin one flash i
   thought of comparisons as varied as the cat the bullfrog the mythic
   satyr and the human being not jove himself had had so colossal and
   protuberant a forehead yet the horns and the noselessness and the
   alligatorlike jaw placed things outside all established categories i
   debated for a time on the reality of the mummies half suspecting they
   were artificial idols; but soon decided they were indeed some
   palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive to
   crown their grotesqueness most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the
   costliest of fabrics and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold
   jewels and unknown shining metals

   the importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast for
   they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and
   ceiling with matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of
   their own wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their
   dimensions; and i could not help but think that their pictured history
   was allegorical perhaps shewing the progress of the race that
   worshiped them these creatures i said to myself were to men of the
   nameless city what the shewolf was to rome or some totembeast is to
   a tribe of indians

   holding this view i could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the
   nameless city; the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the
   world before africa rose out of the waves and of its struggles as the
   sea shrank away and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held
   it i saw its wars and triumphs its troubles and defeats and
   afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its
   peoplehere represented in allegory by the grotesque reptileswere
   driven to chisel their way down though the rocks in some marvelous
   manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them it was
   all vividly weird and realistic and its connection with the awesome
   descent i had made was unmistakable i even recognized the passages

   as i crept along the corridor toward the brighter light i saw later
   stages of the painted epicthe leavetaking of the race that had dwelt
   in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years; the
   race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so
   long where they had settled as nomads in the earths youth hewing in
   the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they had never ceased to
   worship now that the light was better i studied the pictures more
   closely and remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the
   unknown men pondered upon the customs of the nameless city many
   things were peculiar and inexplicable the civilization which included
   a written alphabet had seemingly risen to a higher order than those
   immeasurably later civilizations of egypt and chaldaea yet there were
   curious omissions i could for example find no pictures to represent
   deaths or funeral customs save such as were related to wars violence
   and plagues; and i wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural
   death it was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a
   cheering illusion

   still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost
   picturesqueness and extravagance: contrasted views of the nameless city
   in its desertion and growing ruin and of the strange new realm of
   paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone in
   these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by
   moonlight golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls and
   halfrevealing the splendid perfection of former times shown
   spectrally and elusively by the artist the paradisal scenes were
   almost too extravagant to be believed portraying a hidden world of
   eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys
   at the very last i thought i saw signs of an artistic anticlimax the
   paintings were less skillful and much more bizarre than even the
   wildest of the earlier scenes they seemed to record a slow decadence
   of the ancient stock coupled with a growing ferocity toward the
   outside world from which it was driven by the desert the forms of the
   peoplealways represented by the sacred reptilesappeared to be
   gradually wasting away though their spirit as shewn hovering above the
   ruins by moonlight gained in proportion emaciated priests displayed
   as reptiles in ornate robes cursed the upper air and all who breathed
   it; and one terrible final scene shewed a primitivelooking man
   perhaps a pioneer of ancient irem the city of pillars torn to pieces
   by members of the elder race i remember how the arabs fear the
   nameless city and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and
   ceiling were bare

   as i viewed the pageant of mural history i had approached very closely
   to the end of the lowceiled hall and was aware of a gate through
   which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence creeping up to it
   i cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond; for instead
   of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of
   uniform radiance such one might fancy when gazing down from the peak
   of mount everest upon a sea of sunlit mist behind me was a passage so
   cramped that i could not stand upright in it; before me was an infinity
   of subterranean effulgence

   reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep
   flight of stepssmall numerous steps like those of black passages i
   had traversedbut after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed
   everything swung back open against the lefthand wall of the passage
   was a massive door of brass incredibly thick and decorated with
   fantastic basreliefs which could if closed shut the whole inner world
   of light away from the vaults and passages of rock i looked at the
   step and for the nonce dared not try them i touched the open brass
   door and could not move it then i sank prone to the stone floor my
   mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a deathlike
   exhaustion could banish

   as i lay still with closed eyes free to ponder many things i had
   lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible
   significancescenes representing the nameless city in its heydaythe
   vegetations of the valley around it and the distant lands with which
   its merchants traded the allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me
   by its universal prominence and i wondered that it would be so closely
   followed in a pictured history of such importance in the frescoes the
   nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles i
   wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been and
   reflected a moment on certain oddities i had noticed in the ruins i
   thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the
   underground corridor which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference
   to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the
   worshipers to crawling perhaps the very rites here involved crawling
   in imitation of the creatures no religious theory however could
   easily explain why the level passages in that awesome descent should be
   as low as the templesor lower since one cold not even kneel in it
   as i thought of the crawling creatures whose hideous mummified forms
   were so close to me i felt a new throb of fear mental associations
   are curious and i shrank from the idea that except for the poor
   primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting mine was the only
   human form amidst the many relics and symbols of the primordial life

   but as always in my strange and roving existence wonder soon drove out
   fear; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a
   problem worthy of the greatest explorer that a weird world of mystery
   lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps i could not doubt
   and i hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted
   corridor had failed to give the frescoes had pictured unbelievable
   cities and valleys in this lower realm and my fancy dwelt on the rich
   and colossal ruins that awaited me

   my fears indeed concerned the past rather than the future not even
   the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead
   reptiles and antediluvian frescoes miles below the world i knew and
   faced by another world of eerie light and mist could match the lethal
   dread i felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul an
   ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from
   the primal stones and rockhewn temples of the nameless city while the
   very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and
   continents that man has forgotten with only here and there some
   vaguely familiar outlines of what could have happened in the
   geological ages since the paintings ceased and the deathhating race
   resentfully succumbed to decay no man might say life had once teemed
   in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now i was alone with
   vivid relics and i trembled to think of the countless ages through
   which these relics had kept a silent deserted vigil

   suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had
   intermittently seized me ever since i first saw the terrible valley and
   the nameless city under a cold moon and despite my exhaustion i found
   myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along
   the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world my
   sensations were like those which had made me shun the nameless city at
   night and were as inexplicable as they were poignant in another
   moment however i received a still greater shock in the form of a
   definite soundthe first which had broken the utter silence of these
   tomblike depths it was a deep low moaning as of a distant throng of
   condemned spirits and came from the direction in which i was staring
   its volume rapidly grew till it soon reverberated rightfully through
   the low passage and at the same time i became conscious of an
   increasing draught of old air likewise flowing from the tunnels and
   the city above the touch of this air seemed to restore my balance for
   i instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth
   of the abyss each sunset and sunrise one of which had indeed revealed
   the hidden tunnels to me i looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was
   near so bracing myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to
   its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening my fear again waned
   low since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the
   unknown

   more and more madly poured the shrieking moaning night wind into the
   gulf of the inner earth i dropped prone again and clutched vainly at
   the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the
   phosphorescent abyss such fury i had not expected and as i grew aware
   of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss i was beset by a
   thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination the malignancy of
   the blast awakened incredible fancies; once more i compared myself
   shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful corridor the
   man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race for in the fiendish
   clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive
   rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent i think i
   screamed frantically near the lasti was almost madof the howling
   windwraiths i tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent
   but i could not even hold my own as i was pushed slowly and inexorably
   toward the unknown world finally reason must have wholly snapped; for
   i fell babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad
   arab alhazred who dreamed of the nameless city:

     that is not dead which can eternal lie
     and with strange aeons even death may die

   only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took placewhat
   indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark i endured or what
   abaddon guided me back to life where i must always remember and shiver
   in the night wind till oblivionor worseclaims me monstrous
   unnatural colossal was the thingtoo far beyond all the ideas of man
   to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours of the morning
   when one cannot sleep

   i have said that the fury of the rushing blast was
   infernalcacodaemoniacaland that its voices were hideous with the
   pentup viciousness of desolate eternities presently these voices
   while still chaotic before me seemed to my beating brain to take
   articulate form behind me; and down there in the grave of unnumbered
   aeondead antiquities leagues below the dawnlit world of men i heard
   the ghastly cursing and snarling of strangetongued fiends turning i
   saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be
   seen against the dusk of the corridora nightmare horde of rushing
   devils; hate distorted grotesquely panoplied half transparent devils
   of a race no man might mistakethe crawling reptiles of the nameless
   city

   and as the wind died away i was plunged into the ghoulpooled darkness
   of earths bowels; for behind the last of the creatures the great
   brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose
   reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun
   as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile

   1364031the night oceanby r h barlow and h p lovecraft1936

   i went to ellston beach not only for the pleasures of sun and ocean
   but to rest a weary mind since i knew no person in the little town
   which thrives on summer vacationists and presents only blank windows
   during most of the year there seemed no likelihood that i might be
   disturbed this pleased me for i did not wish to see anything but the
   expanse of pounding surf and the beach lying before my temporary home

   my long work of the summer was completed when i left the city and the
   large mural design produced by it had been entered in the contest it
   had taken me the bulk of the year to finish the painting and when the
   last brush was cleaned i was no longer reluctant to yield to the claims
   of health and find rest and seclusion for a time indeed when i had
   been a week on the beach i recalled only now and then the work whose
   success had so recently seemed allimportant there was no longer the
   old concern with a hundred complexities of colour and ornament; no
   longer the fear and mistrust of my ability to render a mental image
   actual and turn by my own skill alone the dimconceived idea into the
   careful draught of a design and yet that which later befell me by the
   lonely shore may have grown solely from the mental constitution behind
   such concern and fear and mistrust for i have always been a seeker a
   dreamer and a ponderer on seeking and dreaming; and who can say that
   such a nature does not open latent eyes sensitive to unsuspected worlds
   and orders of being?

   now that i am trying to tell what i saw i am conscious of a thousand
   maddening limitations things seen by the inward sight like those
   flashing visions which come as we drift into the blankness of sleep
   are more vivid and meaningful to us in that form than when we have
   sought to weld them with reality set a pen to a dream and the colour
   drains from it the ink with which we write seems diluted with
   something holding too much of reality and we find that after all we
   cannot delineate the incredible memory it is as if our inward selves
   released from the bonds of daytime and objectivity revelled in
   prisoned emotions which are hastily stifled when we would translate
   them in dreams and visions lie the greatest creations of man for on
   them rests no yoke of line or hue forgotten scenes and lands more
   obscure than the golden world of childhood spring into the sleeping
   mind to reign until awakening puts them to rout amid these may be
   attained something of the glory and contentment for which we yearn;
   some adumbration of sharp beauties suspected but not before revealed
   which are to us as the grail to holy spirits of the mediaeval world to
   shape these things on the wheel of art to seek to bring some faded
   trophy from that intangible realm of shadow and gossamer requires
   equal skill and memory for although dreams are in all of us few hands
   may grasp their mothwings without tearing them

   such skill this narrative does not have if i might i would reveal to
   you the hinted events which i perceived dimly like one who peers into
   an unlit realm and glimpses forms whose motion is concealed in my
   mural design which then lay with a multitude of others in the building
   for which they were planned i had striven equally to catch a trace of
   this elusive shadowworld and had perhaps succeeded better than i
   shall now succeed my stay in ellston was to await the judging of that
   design; and when days of unfamiliar leisure had given me perspective i
   discovered thatin spite of those weaknesses which a creator always
   detects most clearlyi had indeed managed to retain in line and colour
   some fragments snatched from the endless world of imagining the
   difficulties of the process and the resulting strain on all my powers
   had undermined my health and brought me to the beach during this period
   of waiting

   since i wished to be wholly alone i rented (to the delight of the
   incredulous owner) a small house some distance from the village of
   ellstonwhich because of the waning season was alive with a moribund
   bustle of tourists uniformly uninteresting to me the house dark from
   the seawind though it had not been painted was not even a satellite
   of the village; but swung below it on the coast like a pendulum beneath
   a still clock quite alone upon a hill of weedgrown sand like a
   solitary warm animal it crouched facing the sea and its inscrutable
   dirty windows stared upon a lonely realm of earth and sky and enormous
   sea it will not do to use too much imagining in a narrative whose
   facts could they be augmented and fitted into a mosaic would be
   strange enough in themselves; but i thought the little house was lonely
   when i saw it and that like myself it was conscious of its
   meaningless nature before the great sea

   i took the place in late august arriving a day before i was expected
   and encountering a van and two workingmen unloading the furniture
   provided by the owner i did not know then how long i would stay and
   when the truck that brought the goods had left i settled my small
   luggage and locked the door (feeling very proprietary about having a
   house after months of a rented room) to go down the weedy hill and on
   the beach since it was quite square and had but one room the house
   required little exploration two windows in each side provided a great
   quantity of light and somehow a door had been squeezed in as an
   afterthought on the oceanward wall the place had been built about ten
   years previously but on account of its distance from ellston village
   was difficult to rent even during the active summer season there being
   no fireplace it stood empty and alone from october until far into
   spring though actually less than a mile below ellston it seemed more
   remote; since a bend in the coast caused one to see only grassy dunes
   in the direction of the village

   the first day halfgone when i was installed i spent in the enjoyment
   of sun and restless waterthings whose quiet majesty made the
   designing of murals seem distant and tiresome but this was the natural
   reaction to a long concern with one set of habits and activities i was
   through with my work and my vacation was begun this fact while
   elusive for the moment showed in everything which surrounded me that
   afternoon of my arrival; and in the utter change from old scenes there
   was an effect of bright sun upon a shifting sea of waves whose
   mysteriously impelled curves were strewn with what appeared to be
   rhinestones perhaps a watercolour might have caught the solid masses
   of intolerable light which lay upon the beach where the sea mingled
   with the sand although the ocean bore her own hue it was dominated
   wholly and incredibly by the enormous glare there was no other person
   near me and i enjoyed the spectacle without the annoyance of any alien
   object upon the stage each of my senses was touched in a different
   way but sometimes it seemed that the roar of the sea was akin to that
   great brightness or as if the waves were glaring instead of the sun
   each of these being so vigorous and insistent that impressions coming
   from them were mingled curiously i saw no one bathing near my little
   square house during that or succeeding afternoons although the curving
   shore included a wide beach even more inviting than that at the
   village where the surf was dotted with random figures i supposed that
   this was because of the distance and because there had never been other
   houses below the town why this unbuilt stretch existed i could not
   imagine; since many dwellings straggled along the northward coast
   facing the sea with aimless eyes

   i swam until the afternoon had gone and later having rested walked
   into the little town darkness hid the sea from me as i entered and i
   found in the dingy lights of the streets tokens of a life which was not
   even conscious of the great gloomshrouded thing lying so close there
   were painted women in tinsel adornments and bored men who were no
   longer younga throng of foolish marionettes perched on the lip of the
   oceanchasm; unseeing unwilling to see what lay above them and about
   in the multitudinous grandeur of the stars and the leagues of the night
   ocean i walked along that darkened sea as i went back to the bare
   little house sending the beams of my flashlight out upon the naked and
   impenetrable void in the absence of the moon this light made a solid
   bar athwart the walls of the uneasy tide; and i felt an indescribable
   emotion born of the noise of the waters and the perception of my
   inconceivable smallness as i cast that tiny beam upon a realm immense
   in itself yet only the black border of the earthly deep that nighted
   deep upon which ships were moving alone in the darkness where i could
   not see them gave off the murmur of a distant angry rabble when i
   reached my high residence i knew that i had passed no one during the
   miles walk from the village and yet there somehow lingered an
   impression that i had been all the while accompanied by the spirit of
   the lonely sea it was i thought personified in a shape which was not
   revealed to me but which moved quietly about beyond my range of
   comprehension it was like those actors who wait behind darkened
   scenery in readiness for the lines which will shortly call them before
   our eyes to move and speak in the sudden revelation of the footlights
   at last i shook off this fancy and sought my key to enter the place
   whose bare walls gave a sudden feeling of security

   my cottage was entirely free of the village as if it had wandered down
   the coast and was unable to return; and there i heard nothing of the
   disturbing clamour when i returned each night after supper i generally
   stayed but a short while upon the streets of ellston though sometimes
   i went into the place for the sake of the walk it provided there were
   all the multitude of curioshops and falsely regal theaterfronts that
   clutter vacation towns but i never went into these; and the place
   seemed useful only for its restaurants it was astonishing the number
   of useless things people found to do there was a succession of
   sunfilled days at first i rose early and beheld the grey sky agleam
   with promise of sunrise; a prophecy fulfilled as i stood witness those
   dawns were cold and their colours faint in comparison to that uniform
   radiance of day which gives to every hour the quality of white noon
   that great light so apparent the first day made each succeeding day a
   yellow page in the book of time i noticed that many of the
   beachpeople were displeased by the inordinate sun whereas i sought
   it after grey months of toil the lethargy induced by a physical
   existence in a region governed by the simple thingsthe wind and light
   and waterhad a prompt effect upon me; and since i was anxious to
   continue this healing process i spent all my time outdoors in the
   sunlight this induced a state at once impassive and submissive and
   gave me a feeling of security against the ravenous night as darkness
   is akin to death so is light to vitality through the heritage of a
   million years ago when men were closer to the mother sea and when the
   creatures of which we are born lay languid in the shallow sunpierced
   water we still seek the primal things when we are tired steeping
   ourselves within their lulling security like those early halfmammals
   which had not yet ventured upon the oozy land

   the monotony of the waves gave repose and i had no other occupation
   than witnessing a myriad ocean moods there is a ceaseless change in
   the waterscolours and shades pass over them like the insubstantial
   expressions of a wellknown face; and these are at once communicated to
   us by halfrecognized senses when the sea is restless remembering old
   ships that have gone over her chasms there comes up silently in our
   hearts the longing for a vanished horizon but when she forgets we
   forget also though we know her a lifetime she must always hold an
   alien air as if something too vast to have shape were lurking in the
   universe to which she is a door the morning ocean glimmering with a
   reflected mist of bluewhite cloud and expanding diamond foam has the
   eyes of one who ponders on strange things and her intricately woven
   webs through which dart a myriad coloured fishes hold the air of some
   great idle thing which will arise presently from the hoary immemorial
   chasms and stride upon the land

   i was content for many days and glad that i had chosen the lonely
   house which sat like a small beast upon those rounded cliffs of sand
   among the pleasantly aimless amusements fostered by such a life i took
   to following the edge of the tide (where the waves left a damp
   irregular outline rimmed with evanescent foam) for long distances; and
   sometimes i found curious bits of shell in the chance litter of the
   sea there was an astonishing lot of debris on that inwardcurving
   coast which my bare little house overlooked and i judged that currents
   whose courses diverge from the village beach must reach that spot at
   any rate my pocketswhen i had anygenerally held vast stores of
   trash; most of which i threw away an hour or two after picking it up
   wondering why i had kept it once however i found a small bone whose
   nature i could not identify save that it was certainly nothing out of
   a fish; and i kept this along with a large metal bead whose minutely
   carven design was rather unusual this latter depicted a fishy thing
   against a patterned background of seaweed instead of the usual floral
   or geometrical designs and was still clearly traceable though worn
   with years of tossing in the surf since i had never seen anything like
   it i judged that it represented some fashion now forgotten of a
   previous year at ellston where similar fads were common

   i had been there perhaps a week when the weather began a gradual
   change each stage of this progressive darkening was followed by
   another subtly intensified so that in the end the entire atmosphere
   surrounding me had shifted from day to evening this was more obvious
   to me in a series of mental impressions than in what i actually
   witnessed for the small house was lonely under the grey skies and
   there was sometimes a beating wind that came out of the ocean bearing
   moisture the sun was displaced by long intervals of cloudinesslayers
   of grey mist beyond whose unknown depth the sun lay cut off though it
   might glare with the old intensity above that enormous veil it could
   not penetrate the beach was a prisoner in a hueless vault for hours at
   a time as if something of the night were welling into other hours

   although the wind was invigorating and the ocean whipped into little
   churning spirals of activity by the vagrant flapping i found the water
   growing chill so that i could not stay in it as long as i had done
   previously and thus i fell into the habit of long walks whichwhen i
   was unable to swimprovided the exercise that i was so careful to
   obtain these walks covered a greater range of seaedge than my
   previous wanderings and since the beach extended in a stretch of miles
   beyond the tawdry village i often found myself wholly isolated upon an
   endless area of sand as evening drew close when this occurred i would
   stride hastily along the whispering seaborder following the outline
   so that i should not wander inland and lose my way and sometimes when
   these walks were late (as they grew increasingly to be) i would come
   upon the crouching house that looked like a harbinger of the village
   insecure upon the windgnawed cliffs a dark blot upon the morbid hues
   of the ocean sunset it was more lonely than by the full light of
   either orb; and seemed to my imagination like a mute questioning face
   turned toward me expectant of some action that the place was isolated
   i have said and this at first pleased me; but in that brief evening
   hour when the sun left a goresplattered decline and darkness lumbered
   on like an expanding shapeless blot there was an alien presence about
   the place: a spirit a mood an impression that came from the surging
   wind the gigantic sky and that sea which drooled blackening waves
   upon a beach grown abruptly strange at these times i felt an
   uneasiness which had no very definite cause although my solitary
   nature had made me long accustomed to the ancient silence and the
   ancient voice of nature these misgivings to which i could have put no
   sure name did not affect me long yet i think now that all the while a
   gradual consciousness of the oceans immense loneliness crept upon me
   a loneliness that was made subtly horrible by intimationswhich were
   never more than suchof some animation or sentience preventing me from
   being wholly alone

   the noisy yellow streets of the town with their curiously unreal
   activity were very far away and when i went there for my evening meal
   (mistrusting a diet entirely of my own ambiguous cooking) i took
   increasing and quite unreasonable care that i should return to the
   cottage before the late darkness although i was often abroad until ten
   or so

   you will say that such action is unreasonable; that if i had feared the
   darkness in some childish way i would have entirely avoided it you
   will ask me why i did not leave the place since its loneliness was
   depressing me to all this i have no reply save that whatever unrest i
   felt whatever of remote disturbance there was to me in brief aspects
   of the darkening sun or in the eager saltbrittle wind or in the robe
   of the dark sea that lay crumpled like an enormous garment so close to
   me was something which had an origin half in my own heart which
   showed itself only at fleeting moments and which had no very long
   effect upon me in the recurrent days of diamond light with sportive
   waves flinging blue peaks at the basking shore the memory of dark
   moods seemed rather incredible yet only an hour or two afterward i
   might again experience those moods and descend to a dim region of
   despair perhaps these inward emotions were only a reflection of the
   seas own mood; for although half of what we see is coloured by the
   interpretation placed upon it by our minds many of our feelings are
   shaped quite distinctly by external physical things the sea can bind
   us to her many moods whispering to us by the subtle token of a shadow
   or a gleam upon the waves and hinting in these ways of her
   mournfulness or rejoicing always she is remembering old things and
   these memories though we may not grasp them are imparted to us so
   that we share her gaiety or remorse since i was doing no work seeing
   no person that i knew i was perhaps susceptible to shades of her
   cryptic meaning which would have been overlooked by another the ocean
   ruled my life during the whole of that late summer; demanding it as
   recompense for the healing she had brought me

   there were drownings at the beach that year and while i heard of these
   only casually (such is our indifference to a death which does not
   concern us and to which we are not witness) i knew that their details
   were unsavoury the people who diedsome of them swimmers of a skill
   beyond the averagewere sometimes not found until many days had
   elapsed and the hideous vengeance of the deep had scourged their
   rotten bodies it was as if the sea had dragged them into a chasmlair
   and had mulled them about in the darkness until satisfied that they
   were no longer of any use she had floated them ashore in a ghastly
   state no one seemed to know what had caused these deaths their
   frequency excited alarm among the timid since the undertow at ellston
   was not strong and since there were known to be no sharks at hand
   whether the bodies showed marks of any attacks i did not learn but the
   dread of a death which moves among the waves and comes on lone people
   from a lightless motionless place is a dread which men know and do not
   like they must quickly find a reason for such a death even if there
   are no sharks since sharks formed only a suspected cause and one
   never to my knowledge confirmed the swimmers who continued during the
   rest of the season were on guard against treacherous tides rather than
   against any possible seaanimal autumn indeed was not a great
   distance off and some people used this as an excuse for leaving the
   sea where men were snared by death and going to the security of
   inland fields where one cannot even hear the ocean so august ended
   and i had been at the beach many days

   there had been a threat of a storm since the fourth of the new month
   and on the sixth when i set out for a walk in the damp wind there was
   a mass of formless cloud colourless and oppressive above the ruffled
   leaden sea the motion of the wind directed toward no especial goal
   but stirring uneasily provided a sensation of coming animationa hint
   of life in the elements which might be the longexpected storm i had
   eaten my luncheon at ellston and though the heavens seemed the closing
   lid of a great casket i ventured far down the beach and away from both
   the town and my nolongertobeseen house as the universal grey
   became spotted with a carrion purplecuriously brilliant despite its
   sombre huei found that i was several miles from any possible shelter
   this however did not seem very important; for despite the dark skies
   with their added glow of unknown presage i was in a curious mood of
   detachment paralleling that glowa mood which flashed through a body
   grown suddenly alert and sensitive to the outline of shapes and
   meanings that were previously dim obscurely a memory came to me;
   suggested by the likeness of the scene to one i had imagined when a
   story was read to me in childhood that taleof which i had not
   thought for many yearsconcerned a woman who was loved by the
   darkbearded king of an underwater realm of blurred cliffs where
   fishthings lived and who was taken from the goldenhaired youth of
   her troth by a dark being crowned with a priestlike mitre and having
   the features of a withered ape what had remained in the corner of my
   fancy was the image of cliffs beneath the water against the hueless
   dusky nosky of such a realm; and this though i had forgotten most of
   the story was recalled quite unexpectedly by the same pattern of cliff
   and sky which i then beheld the sight was similar to what i had
   imagined in a year now lost save for random incomplete impressions
   suggestions of this story may have lingered behind certain irritating
   unfinished memories and in certain values hinted to my senses by
   scenes whose actual worth was bafflingly small frequently in flashes
   of momentary perception (the conditions more than the object being
   significant) we feel that certain isolated scenes and arrangementsa
   feathery landscape a womans dress along the curve of a road by
   afternoon or the solidity of a centurydefying tree against the pale
   morning skyhold something precious some golden virtue that we must
   grasp and yet when such a scene or arrangement is viewed later or
   from another point we find that it has lost its value and meaning for
   us perhaps this is because the thing we see does not hold that elusive
   quality but only suggests to the mind some very different thing which
   remains unremembered the baffled mind not wholly sensing the cause of
   its flashing appreciation seizes on the object exciting it and is
   surprised when there is nothing of worth therein thus it was when i
   beheld the purpling clouds they held the stateliness and mystery of
   old monastery towers at twilight but their aspect was also that of the
   cliffs in the old fairytale suddenly reminded of this lost image i
   half expected to see in the finespun dirty foam and among the waves
   which were now as if they had been poured of flawed black glass the
   horrid figure of that apefaced creature wearing a mitre old with
   verdigris advancing from its kingdom in some lost gulf to which those
   waves were sky

   i did not see any such creature from the realm of imagining but as the
   chill wind veered slitting the heavens like a rustling knife there
   lay in the gloom of merging cloud and water only a grey object like a
   piece of driftwood tossing obscurely on the foam this was a
   considerable distance out and since it vanished shortly may not have
   been wood but a porpoise coming to the troubled surface i soon found
   that i had stayed too long contemplating the rising storm and linking
   my early fancies with its grandeur for an icy rain began spotting
   down bringing a more uniform gloom upon a scene already too dark for
   the hour hurrying along the grey sand i felt the impact of cold drops
   upon my back and before many moments my clothing was soaked
   throughout at first i had run put to flight by the colourless drops
   whose pattern hung in long linking strands from an unseen sky but
   after i saw that refuge was too far to reach in anything like a dry
   state i slackened my pace and returned home as if i had walked under
   clear skies there was not much reason to hurry although i did not
   idle as upon previous occasions the constraining wet garments were
   cold upon me; and with the gathering darkness and the wind that rose
   endlessly from the ocean i could not repress a shiver yet there was
   beside the discomfort of the precipitous rain an exhilaration latent
   in the purplish ravelled masses of cloud and the stimulated reactions
   of my body in a mood half of exultant pleasure from resisting the rain
   (which streamed from me now and filled my shoes and pockets) and half
   of strange appreciation of those morbid dominant skies which hovered
   with dark wings above the shifting eternal sea i tramped along the
   grey corridor of ellston beach more rapidly than i had expected the
   crouching house showed in the oblique flapping rain and all the weeds
   of the sand cliff writhed in accompaniment to the frantic wind as if
   they would uproot themselves to join the fartravelling element sea
   and sky had altered not at all and the scene was that which had
   accompanied me save that there was now painted upon it the hunching
   roof that seemed to bend from the assailing rain i hurried up the
   insecure steps and let myself into a dry room where unconsciously
   surprised that i was free of the nagging wind i stood for a moment
   with water rilling from every inch of me

   there are two windows in the front of that house one on each side and
   these face nearly straight upon the ocean; which i now saw half
   obscured by the combined veils of the rain and of the imminent night
   from these windows i looked as i dressed myself in a motley array of
   dry garments seized from convenient hangers and from a chair too laden
   to sit upon i was prisoned on all sides by an unnaturally increased
   dusk which had filtered down at some undefined hour under cover of the
   storm how long i had been on the reaches of wet grey sand or what the
   real time was i could not tell though a moments search produced my
   watchfortunately left behind and thus avoiding the uniform wetness of
   my clothing i half guessed the hour from the dimly seen hands which
   were only slightly less indecipherable than the surrounding figures in
   another moment my sight penetrated the gloom (greater in the house than
   beyond the bleared window) and saw that it was 6:45

   there had been no one upon the beach as i came in and naturally i
   expected to see no further swimmers that night yet when i looked again
   from the window there appeared surely to be figures blotting the grime
   of the wet evening i counted three moving about in some
   incomprehensible manner and close to the house anotherwhich may not
   have been a person but a waveejected log for the surf was now
   pounding fiercely i was startled to no little degree and wondered for
   what purpose those hardy persons stayed out in such a storm and then i
   thought that perhaps like myself they had been caught unintentionally
   in the rain and had surrendered to the watery gusts in another moment
   prompted by a certain civilised hospitality which overcame my love of
   solitude i stepped to the door and emerged momentarily (at the cost of
   another wetting for the rain promptly descended upon me in exultant
   fury) on the small porch gesticulating toward the people but whether
   they did not see me or did not understand they made no returning
   signal dim in the evening they stood as if halfsurprised or as if
   they awaited some other action from me there was in their attitude
   something of that cryptic blankness signifying anything or nothing
   which the house wore about itself as seen in the morbid sunset
   abruptly there came to me a feeling that a sinister quality lurked
   about those unmoving figures who chose to stay in the rainy night upon
   a beach deserted by all people and i closed the door with a surge of
   annoyance which sought all too vainly to disguise a deeper emotion of
   fear; a consuming fright that welled up from the shadows of my
   consciousness a moment later when i had stepped to the window there
   seemed to be nothing outside but the portentous night vaguely puzzled
   and even more vaguely frightenedlike one who has seen no alarming
   thing but is apprehensive of what may be found in the dark street he
   is soon compelled to crossi decided that i had very possibly seen no
   one and that the murky air had deceived me

   the aura of isolation about the place increased that night though just
   out of sight on the northward beach a hundred houses rose in the rainy
   darkness their light bleared and yellow above streets of polished
   glass like goblineyes reflected in an oily forest pool yet because i
   could not see them or even reach them in bad weathersince i had no
   car nor any way to leave the crouching house except by walking in the
   figurehaunted darknessi realized quite suddenly that i was to all
   intents alone with the dreary sea that rose and subsided unseen
   unkenned in the mist and the voice of the sea had become a hoarse
   groan like that of something wounded which shifts about before trying
   to rise

   fighting away the prevalent gloom with a soiled lampfor the darkness
   crept in at my windows and sat peering obscurely at me from the corners
   like a patient animali prepared my food since i had no intention of
   going to the village the hour seemed incredibly advanced though it
   was not yet nine oclock when i went to bed darkness had come early
   and furtively and throughout the remainder of my stay lingered
   evasively over each scene and action which i beheld something had
   settled out of the nightsomething forever undefined but stirring a
   latent sense within me so that i was like a beast expecting the
   momentary rustle of an enemy

   there were hours of wind and sheets of the downpour flapped endlessly
   on the meagre walls barring it from me lulls came in which i heard the
   mumbling sea and i could guess that large formless waves jostled one
   another in the pallid whine of the winds and flung on the beach a
   spray bitter with salt yet in the very monotony of the restless
   elements i found a lethargic note a sound that beguiled me after a
   time into slumber grey and colourless as the night the sea continued
   its mad monologue and the wind her nagging but these were shut out by
   the walls of unconsciousness and for a time the night ocean was
   banished from a sleeping mind

   morning brought an enfeebled suna sun like that which men will see
   when the earth is old if there are any men left: a sun more weary than
   the shrouded moribund sky faint echo of its old image phoebus strove
   to pierce the ragged ambiguous clouds as i awoke at moments sending a
   wash of pale gold rippling across the northwestern interior of my
   house at others waning till it was only a luminous ball like some
   incredible plaything forgotten on the celestial lawn after a while the
   falling rainwhich must have continued throughout the previous
   nightsucceeded in washing away those vestiges of purple cloud which
   had been like the oceancliffs in an old fairytale cheated alike of
   the setting and rising sun that day merged with the day before as if
   the intervening storm had not ushered a long darkness into the world
   but had swollen and subsided into one long afternoon gaining heart
   the furtive sun exerted all his force in dispelling the old mist
   streaked now like a dirty window and cast it from his realm the
   shallow blue day advanced as those grimy wisps retreated and the
   loneliness which had encircled me welled back into a watchful place of
   retreat whence it went no farther but crouched and waited

   the ancient brightness was now once more upon the sun and the old
   glitter on the waves whose playful blue shapes had flocked upon that
   coast ere man was born and would rejoice unseen when he was forgotten
   in the sepulchre of time influenced by these thin assurances like one
   who believes the smile of friendship on an enemys features i opened
   my door and as it swung outward a black spot upon the inward burst of
   light i saw the beach washed clean of any track as if no foot before
   mine had disturbed the smooth sand with the quick lift of spirit that
   follows a period of uneasy depression i feltin a purely yielding
   fashion and without volitionthat my own memory was washed clean of
   all the mistrust and suspicion and diseaselike fear of a lifetime
   just as the filth of the waters edge succumbs to a particularly high
   tide and is carried out of sight there was a scent of soaked
   brackish grass like the mouldy pages of a book commingled with a
   sweet odour born of the hot sunlight upon inland meadows and these
   were borne into me like an exhilarating drink seeping and tingling
   through my veins as if they would convey to me something of their own
   impalpable nature and float me dizzily in the aimless breeze and
   conspiring with these things the sun continued to shower upon me like
   the rain of yesterday an incessant array of bright spears; as if it
   also wished to hide that suspected background presence which moved
   beyond my sight and was betrayed only by a careless rustle on the
   borders of my consciousness or by the aspect of blank figures staring
   out of an ocean void that sun a fierce ball solitary in the whirlpool
   of infinity was like a horde of golden moths against my upturned face
   a bubbling white grail of fire divine and incomprehensible it withheld
   from me a thousand promised mirages where it granted one for the sun
   did actually seem to indicate realms secure and fanciful where if i
   but knew the path i might wander in this curious exultation such
   things come of our own natures for life has never yielded for one
   moment her secrets; and it is only in our interpretation of their
   hinted images that we may find ecstasy or dullness according to a
   deliberately induced mood yet ever and again we must succumb to her
   deceptions believing for the moment that we may this time find the
   withheld joy and in this way the fresh sweetness of the wind on a
   morning following the haunted darkness (whose evil intimations had
   given me a greater uneasiness than any menace to my body) whispered to
   me of ancient mysteries only halflinked with earth and of pleasures
   that were the sharper because i felt that i might experience only a
   part of them the sun and wind and that scent that rose upon them told
   me of festivals of gods whose senses are a millionfold more poignant
   than mans and whose joys are a millionfold more subtle and prolonged
   these things they hinted could be mine if i gave myself wholly into
   their bright deceptive power and the sun a crouching god with naked
   celestial flesh an unknown toomighty furnace upon which eye might
   not look seemed almost sacred in the glow of my newly sharpened
   emotions the ethereal thunderous light it gave was something before
   which all things must worship astonished the slinking leopard in his
   greenchasmed forest must have paused briefly to consider its
   leafscattered rays and all things nurtured by it must have cherished
   its bright message on such a day for when it is absent in the far
   reaches of eternity earth will be lost and black against an
   illimitable void that morning in which i shared the fire of life and
   whose brief moment of pleasure is secure against the ravenous years
   was astir with the beckoning of strange things whose elusive names can
   never be written

   as i made my way toward the village wondering how it might look after
   a longneeded scrubbing by the industrious rain i saw tangled in a
   glimmer of sunlit moisture that was poured over it like a yellow
   vintage a small object like a hand some twenty feet ahead of me and
   touched by the repetitious foam the shock and disgust born in my
   startled mind when i saw that it was indeed a piece of rotten flesh
   overcame my new contentment and engendered a shocked suspicion that it
   might actually be a hand certainly no fish or part of one could
   assume that look and i thought i saw mushy fingers wed in decay i
   turned the thing over with my foot not wishing to touch so foul an
   object and it adhered stickily to the leather shoe as if clutching
   with the grasp of corruption the thing whose shape was nearly lost
   held too much resemblance to what i feared it might be; and i pushed it
   into the willing grasp of a seething wave which took it from sight
   with an alacrity not often shown by those ravelled edges of the sea
   perhaps i should have reported my find yet its nature was too
   ambiguous to make action natural since it had been partly eaten by
   some oceandwelling monstrousness i did not think it identifiable
   enough to form evidence of an unknown but possible tragedy the
   numerous drownings of course came into my mindas well as other
   things lacking in wholesomeness some of which remained only as
   possibilities whatever the stormdislodged fragment may have been and
   whether it were fish or some animal akin to man i have never spoken of
   it until now after all there was no proof that it had not merely been
   distorted by rottenness into that shape

   i approached the town sickened by the presence of such an object
   amidst the apparent beauty of the clean beach though it was horribly
   typical of the indifference of death in a nature which mingles
   rottenness with beauty and perhaps loves the former more in ellston i
   heard of no recent drowning or other mishap of the sea and found no
   reference to such in the columns of the local paperthe only one i
   read during my stay it is difficult to describe the mental state in
   which succeeding days found me always susceptible to morbid emotions
   whose dark anguish might be induced by things outside myself or might
   spring from the abysses of my own spirit i was ridden by a feeling
   which was not of fear or despair or anything akin to these but was
   rather a perception of the brief hideousness and underlying filth of
   lifea feeling partly a reflection of my internal nature and partly a
   result of broodings induced by that gnawed rotten object which may have
   been a hand in those days my mind was a place of shadowed cliffs and
   dark moving figures like the ancient unsuspected realm which the
   fairytale recalled to me i felt in brief agonies of disillusionment
   the gigantic blackness of this overwhelming universe in which my days
   and the days of my race were as nothing to the shattered stars; a
   universe in which each action is vain and even the emotion of grief a
   wasted thing the hours i had previously spent in something of regained
   health contentment and physical wellbeing were given now (as if those
   days of the previous week were something definitely ended) to an
   indolence like that of a man who no longer cares to live i was
   engulfed by a piteous lethargic fear of some ineluctable doom which
   would be i felt the completed hate of the peering stars and of the
   black enormous waves that hoped to clasp my bones within themthe
   vengeance of all the indifferent horrendous majesty of the night
   ocean

   something of the darkness and restlessness of the sea had penetrated my
   heart so that i lived in an unreasoning unperceiving torment a
   torment none the less acute because of the subtlety of its origin and
   the strange unmotivated quality of its vampiric existence before my
   eyes lay the phantasmagoria of the purpling clouds the strange silver
   bauble the recurrent stagnant foam the loneliness of that bleakeyed
   house and the mockery of the puppet town i no longer went to the
   village for it seemed only a travesty of life like my own soul it
   stood upon a dark enveloping seaa sea grown slowly hateful to me
   and among these images corrupt and festering dwelt that of an object
   whose human contours left ever smaller the doubt of what it once had
   been

   these scribbled words can never tell of the hideous loneliness
   (something i did not even wish assuaged so deeply was it embedded in
   my heart) which had insinuated itself within me mumbling of terrible
   and unknown things stealthily circling nearer it was not a madness:
   rather it was a too clear and naked perception of the darkness beyond
   this frail existence lit by a momentary sun no more secure than
   ourselves: a realization of futility that few can experience and ever
   again touch the life about them: a knowledge that turn as i might
   battle as i might with all the remaining power of my spirit i could
   neither win an inch of ground from the inimical universe nor hold for
   even a moment the life entrusted to me fearing death as i did life
   burdened with a nameless dread yet unwilling to leave the scenes
   evoking it i awaited whatever consummating horror was shifting itself
   in the immense region beyond the walls of consciousness

   thus autumn found me and what i had gained from the sea was lost back
   into it autumn on the beachesa drear time betokened by no scarlet
   leaf nor any other accustomed sign a frightening sea which changes
   not though man changes there was only a chilling of the waters in
   which i no longer cared to entera further darkening of the palllike
   sky as if eternities of snow were waiting to descend upon the ghastly
   waves once that descent began it would never cease but would
   continue beneath the white and the yellow and the crimson sun and
   beneath that ultimate small ruby which shall yield only to the
   futilities of night the once friendly waters babbled meaningfully at
   me and eyed me with a strange regard; yet whether the darkness of the
   scene were a reflection of my own broodings or whether the gloom
   within me were caused by what lay without i could not have told upon
   the beach and me alike had fallen a shadow like that of a bird which
   flies silently overheada bird whose watching eyes we do not suspect
   till the image on the ground repeats the image in the sky and we look
   suddenly upward to find that something has been circling above us
   hitherto unseen the day was in late september and the town had closed
   the resorts where mad frivolity ruled empty fearhaunted lives and
   where raddled puppets performed their summer antics the puppets were
   cast aside smeared with the painted smiles and frowns they had last
   assumed and there were not a hundred people left in the town again
   the gaudy stuccofronted buildings lining the shore were permitted to
   crumble undisturbed in the wind as the month advanced to the day of
   which i speak there grew in me the light of a grey infernal dawn
   wherein i felt some dark thaumaturgy would be completed since i feared
   such a thaumaturgy less than a continuance of my horrible
   suspicionsless than the tooelusive hints of something monstrous
   lurking behind the great stageit was with more speculation than
   actual fear that i waited unendingly for the day of horror which seemed
   to be nearing the day i repeat was late in september though whether
   the 22nd or 23rd i am uncertain such details have fled before the
   recollection of those uncompleted happeningsepisodes with which no
   orderly existence should be plagued because of the damnable
   suggestions (and only suggestions) they contain i knew the time with
   an intuitive distress of spirita recognition too deep for me to
   explain throughout those daylight hours i was expectant of the night;
   impatient perhaps so that the sunlight passed like a halfglimpsed
   reflection in rippled watera day of whose events i recall nothing it
   was long since that portentous storm had cast a shadow over the beach
   and i had determined after hesitations caused by nothing tangible to
   leave ellston since the year was chilling and there was no return to
   my earlier contentment when a telegram came for me (lying two days in
   the western union office before i was located so little was my name
   known) saying that my design had been acceptedwinning above all
   others in the contesti set a date for leaving this news which
   earlier in the year would have affected me strongly i now received
   with a curious apathy it seemed as unrelated to the unreality about
   me as little pertinent to me as if it were directed to another person
   whom i did not know and whose message had come to me through some
   accident none the less it was that which forced me to complete my
   plans and leave the cottage by the shore

   there were only four nights of my stay remaining when there occurred
   the last of those events whose meaning lies more in the darkly sinister
   impression surrounding them than in anything obviously threatening
   night had settled over ellston and the coast and a pile of soiled
   dishes attested both to my recent meal and to my lack of industry
   darkness came as i sat with a cigarette before the seaward window and
   it was a liquid which gradually filled the sky washing in a floating
   moon monstrously elevated the flat sea bordering upon the gleaming
   sand the utter absence of tree or figure or life of any sort and the
   regard of that high moon made the vastness of my surroundings abruptly
   clear there were only a few stars pricking through as if to
   accentuate by their smallness the majesty of the lunar orb and of the
   restless shifting tide

   i had stayed indoors fearing somehow to go out before the sea on such
   a night of shapeless portent but i heard it mumbling secrets of an
   incredible lore borne to me on a wind out of nowhere was the breath of
   some strange and palpitant lifethe embodiment of all i had felt and
   of all i had suspectedstirring now in the chasms of the sky or
   beneath the mute waves in what place this mystery turned from an
   ancient horrible slumber i could not tell but like one who stands by
   a figure lost in sleep knowing that it will awake in a moment i
   crouched by the windows holding a nearly burntout cigarette and
   faced the rising moon

   gradually there passed into that neverstirring landscape a brilliance
   intensified by the overhead glimmerings and i seemed more and more
   under some compulsion to watch whatever might follow the shadows were
   draining from the beach and i felt that they took with were all which
   might have been a harbour for my thoughts when the hinted thing should
   come where any of them did remain they were ebon and blank: still
   lumps of darkness sprawling beneath the cruel brilliant rays the
   endless tableau of the lunar orbdead now whatever her past was and
   cold as the unhuman sepulchres she bears amid the ruin of dusty
   centuries older than manand the seaastir perhaps with some
   unkenned life some forbidden sentienceconfronted me with a horrible
   vividness i arose and shut the window; partly because of an inward
   prompting but mostly i think as an excuse for transferring
   momentarily the stream of thought no sound came to me now as i stood
   before the closed panes minutes or eternities were alike i was
   waiting like my own fearing heart and the motionless scene beyond for
   the token of some ineffable life i had set the lamp upon a box in the
   western corner of the room but the moon was brighter and her bluish
   rays invaded places where the lamplight was faint the ancient glow of
   the round silent orb lay upon the beach as it had lain for aeons and i
   waited in a torment of expectancy made doubly acute by the delay in
   fulfillment and the uncertainty of what strange completion was to
   come

   outside the crouching hut a white illumination suggested vague spectral
   forms whose unreal phantasmal motions seemed to taunt my blindness
   just as unheard voices mocked my eager listening for countless moments
   i was still as if time and the tolling of her great bell were hushed
   into nothingness and yet there was nothing which i might fear: the
   moonchiselled shadows were unnatural in no contour and veiled nothing
   from my eyes the night was silenti knew that despite my closed
   windowand all the stars were fixed mournfully in a listening heaven
   of dark grandeur no motion from me then or word now could reveal my
   plight or tell of the fearracked brain imprisoned in flesh which
   dared not break the silence for all the torture it brought as if
   expectant of death and assured that nothing could serve to banish the
   soulperil i confronted i crouched with a forgotten cigarette in my
   hand a silent world gleamed beyond the cheap dirty windows and in
   one corner of the room a pair of dirty oars placed there before my
   arrival shared the vigil of my spirit the lamp burned endlessly
   yielding a sick light hued like a corpses flesh glancing at it now
   and again for the desperate distraction it gave i saw that many
   bubbles unaccountably rose and vanished in the kerosenefilled base
   curiously enough there was no heat from the wick and suddenly i
   became aware that the night as a whole was neither warm nor cold but
   strangely neutralas if all physical forces were suspended and all
   the laws of a calm existence disrupted

   then with an unheard splash which sent from the silver water to the
   shore a line of ripples echoed in fear by my heart a swimming thing
   emerged beyond the breakers the figure may have been that of a dog a
   human being or something more strange it could not have known that i
   watchedperhaps it did not carebut like a distorted fish it swam
   across the mirrored stars and dived beneath the surface after a moment
   it came up again and this time since it was closer i saw that it was
   carrying something across its shoulder i knew then that it could be
   no animal and that it was a man or something like a man which came
   toward the land from a dark ocean but it swam with a horrible ease as
   i watched dreadfilled and passive with the fixed stare of one who
   awaits death in another yet knows he cannot avert it the swimmer
   approached the shorethough too far down the southward beach for me to
   discern its outlines or features obscurely loping with sparks of
   moonlit foam scattered by its quick gait it emerged and was lost among
   the inland dunes

   now i was possessed by a sudden recurrence of fear which had died away
   in the previous moments there was a tingling coldness all over
   methough the room whose window i dared not open now was stuffy i
   thought it would be very horrible if something were to enter a window
   which was not closed now that i could no longer see the figure i felt
   that it lingered somewhere in the close shadows or peered hideously at
   me from whatever window i did not watch and so i turned my gaze
   eagerly and frantically to each successive pane; dreading that i might
   indeed behold an intrusive regarding face yet unable to keep myself
   from the terrifying inspection but though i watched for hours there
   was no longer anything upon the beach so the night passed and with it
   began the ebbing of that strangenessa strangeness which had surged up
   like an evil brew within a pot had mounted to the very rim in a
   breathless moment had paused uncertainly there and had subsided
   taking with it whatever unknown message it had borne like the stars
   that promise the revelation of terrible and glorious memories goad us
   into worship by this deception and then impart nothing i had come
   frighteningly near to the capture of an old secret which ventured close
   to mans haunts and lurked cautiously just beyond the edge of the
   known yet in the end i had nothing i was given only a glimpse of the
   furtive thing; a glimpse made obscure by the veils of ignorance i
   cannot even conceive what might have shown itself had i been too close
   to that swimmer who went shoreward instead of into the ocean i do not
   know what might have come if the brew had passed the rim of the pot and
   poured outward in a swift cascade of revelation the night ocean
   withheld whatever it had nurtured i shall know nothing more

   even yet i do not know why the ocean holds such a fascination for me
   but then perhaps none of us can solve those thingsthey exist in
   defiance of all explanation there are men and wise men who do not
   like the sea and its lapping surf on yellow shores; and they think us
   strange who love the mystery of the ancient and unending deep yet for
   me there is a haunting and inscrutable glamour in all the oceans
   moods it is in the melancholy silver foam beneath the moons waxen
   corpse; it hovers over the silent and eternal waves that beat on naked
   shores; it is there when all is lifeless save for unknown shapes that
   glide through sombre depths and when i behold the awesome billows
   surging in endless strength there comes upon me an ecstasy akin to
   fear; so that i must abase myself before this mightiness that i may
   not hate the clotted waters and their overwhelming beauty vast and
   lonely is the ocean and even as all things came from it so shall they
   return thereto in the shrouded depths of time none shall reign upon
   the earth nor shall any motion be save in the eternal waters and
   these shall beat on dark shores in thunderous foam though none shall
   remain in that dying world to watch the cold light of the enfeebled
   moon playing on the swirling tides and coarsegrained sand on the
   deeps margin shall rest only a stagnant foam gathering about the
   shells and bones of perished shapes that dwelt within the waters
   silent flabby things will toss and roll along empty shores their
   sluggish life extinct then all shall be dark for at last even the
   white moon on the distant waves shall wink out nothing shall be left
   neither above nor below the sombre waters and until that last
   millennium as after it the sea will thunder and toss throughout the
   dismal night

   1336946the nightmare lakehp lovecraft

   there is a lake in distant zan
   beyond the wonted haunts of man
   where broods alone in a hideous state
   a spirit dead and desolate;
   a spirit ancient and unholy
   heavy with fearsome melancholy
   which from the waters dull and dense
   draws vapors cursed with pestilence
   around the banks a mire of clay
   sprawl things offensive in decay
   and curious birds that reach that shore
   are seen by mortals nevermore
   here shines by day the searing sun
   on glassy wastes beheld by none
   and here by night pale moonbeams flow
   into the deeps that yawn below
   in nightmares only is it told
   what scenes beneath those beams unfold;
   what scenes too old for human sight
   lie sunken there in endless night;
   for in those depths there only pace
   the shadows of a voiceless race
   one midnight redolent of ill
   i saw that lake asleep and still;
   while in the lurid sky there rode
   a gibbous moon that glowd and glowd
   i saw the stretching marshy shore
   and the foul things those marshes bore:
   lizards and snakes convulsd and dying;
   ravens and vampires putrefying;
   all these and hovring oer the dead
   narcophagi that on them fed
   and as the dreadful moon climbd high
   frightning the stars from out the sky
   i saw the lakes dull water glow
   till sunken things appeard below
   there shone unnumberd fathoms down
   the towrs of a forgotten town;
   the tarnishd domes and mossy walls;
   weedtangled spires and empty halls;
   deserted fanes and vaults of dread
   and streets of gold uncoveted
   these i beheld and saw beside
   a horde of shapeless shadows glide;
   a noxious horde which to my glance
   seemd moving in a hideous dance
   round slimy sepulchres that lay
   beside a nevertravelld way
   straight from those tombs a heaving rose
   that vexd the waters dull repose
   while lethal shades of upper space
   howld at the moons sardonic face
   then sank the lake within its bed
   suckd down to caverns of the dead
   till from the reeking newstript earth
   curld foetid fumes of noisome birth
   about the city nigh uncoverd
   the monstrous dancing shadows hoverd
   when lo! there oped with sudden stir
   the portal of each sepulchre!
   no ear may learn no tongue may tell
   what nameless horror then befell
   i see that lakethat moon agrin
   that city and the things within
   waking i pray that on that shore
   the nightmare lake may sink no more!

   the other gods
   by h p lovecraft
   8518the other godsh p lovecraft

   atop the tallest of earths peaks dwell the gods of earth and suffer
   not man to tell that he hath looked upon them lesser peaks they once
   inhabited; but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of
   rock and snow driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till now
   only the last remains when they left their old peaks they took with
   them all signs of themselves save once it is said when they left a
   carven image on the face of the mountain which they called ngranek

   but now they have betaken themselves to unknown kadath in the cold
   waste where no man treads and are grown stern having no higher peak
   whereto to flee at the coming of men they are grown stern and where
   once they suffered men to displace them they now forbid men to come;
   or coming to depart it is well for men that they know not of kadath
   in the cold waste; else they would seek injudiciously to scale it

   sometimes when earths gods are homesick they visit in the still of the
   night the peaks where once they dwelt and weep softly as they try to
   play in the olden way on remembered slopes men have felt the tears of
   the gods on whitecapped thurai though they have thought it rain; and
   have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawnwinds of lerion
   in cloudships the gods are wont to travel and wise cotters have
   legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is
   cloudy for the gods are not lenient as of old

   in ulthar which lies beyond the river skai once dwelt an old man avid
   to behold the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven
   cryptical books of earth and familiar with the pnakotic manuscripts of
   distant and frozen lomar his name was barzai the wise and the
   villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange
   eclipse

   barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and
   goings and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a
   god himself it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when
   they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats and who
   first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at
   midnight on st johns eve barzai was learned in the lore of the
   earths gods and had gained a desire to look upon their faces he
   believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from
   their wrath so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky
   hathegkla on a night when he knew the gods would be there

   hathegkla is far in the stony desert beyond hatheg for which it is
   named and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple around its peak
   the mists play always mournfully for mists are the memories of the
   gods and the gods loved hathegkla when they dwelt upon it in the old
   days often the gods of earth visit hathegkla in their ships of
   clouds casting pale vapors over the slopes as they dance reminiscently
   on the summit under a clear moon the villagers of hatheg say it is ill
   to climb the hathegkla at any time and deadly to climb it by night
   when pale vapors hide the summit and the moon; but barzai heeded them
   not when he came from neighboring ulthar with the young priest atal
   who was his disciple atal was only the son of an innkeeper and was
   sometimes afraid; but barzais father had been a landgrave who dwelt in
   an ancient castle so he had no common superstition in his blood and
   only laughed at the fearful cotters

   barzai and atal went out of hatheg into the stony desert despite the
   prayers of peasants and talked of earths gods by their campfires at
   night many days they traveled and from afar saw lofty hathegkla with
   his aureole of mournful mist on the thirteenth day they reached the
   mountains lonely base and atal spoke of his fears but barzai was old
   and learned and had no fears so led the way up the slope that no man
   had scaled since the time of sansu who is written of with fright in
   the moldy pnakotic manuscripts

   the way was rocky and made perilous by chasms cliffs and falling
   stones later it grew cold and snowy; and barzai and atal often slipped
   and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes finally
   the air grew thin and the sky changed color and the climbers found it
   hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up marveling at the
   strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would
   happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread
   around for three days they climbed higher and higher toward the roof
   of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon

   for four nights no clouds came and the moon shone down cold through
   the thin mournful mist around the silent pinnacle then on the fifth
   night which was the night of the full moon barzai saw some dense
   clouds far to the north and stayed up with atal to watch them draw
   near thick and majestic they sailed slowly and deliberately onward;
   ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers and hiding
   the moon and the summit from view for a long hour the watchers gazed
   whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and
   more restless barzai was wise in the lore of earths gods and
   listened hard for certain sounds but atal felt the chill of the
   vapours and the awe of the night and feared much and when barzai
   began to climb higher and beckon eagerly it was long before atal would
   follow

   so thick were the vapours that the way was hard and though atal
   followed at last he could scarce see the gray shape of barzai on the
   dim slope above in the clouded moonlight barzai forged very far ahead
   and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than atal; fearing not
   the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and
   dauntless man nor pausing at wide black chasms that atal could scarce
   leap and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs slipping and
   stumbling and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of
   bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps

   very suddenly barzai went out of atals sight scaling a hideous cliff
   that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not
   inspired of earths gods atal was far below and planning what he
   should do when he reached the place when curiously he noticed that the
   light had grown strong as if the cloudless peak and moonlit
   meetingplace of the gods were very near and as he scrambled on toward
   the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any
   he had known before then through the high mists he heard the voice of
   barzai shouting wildly in delight:

   i have heard the gods i have heard earths gods singing in revelry on
   hathegkla! the voices of earths gods are known to barzai the prophet!
   the mists are thin and the moon is bright and i shall see the gods
   dancing wildly on hathegkla that they loved in youth the wisdom of
   barzai hath made him greater than earths gods and against his will
   their spells and barriers are as naught; barzai will behold the gods
   the proud gods the secret gods the gods of earth who spurn the sight
   of man!

   atal could not hear the voices barzai heard but he was now close to
   the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds then he heard barzais
   voice grow shriller and louder:

   the mist is very thin and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the
   voices of earths gods are high and wild and they fear the coming of
   barzai the wise who is greater than they the moons light flickers
   as earths gods dance against it; i shall see the dancing forms of the
   gods that leap and howl in the moonlight the light is dimmer and the
   gods are afraid

   whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in
   all the air as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for
   though the way was steeper than ever the upward path was now grown
   fearsomely easy and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when
   he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face the light of the
   moon had strangely failed and as atal plunged upward through the mists
   he heard barzai the wise shrieking in the shadows:

   the moon is dark and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in
   the sky for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of
   men or of earths gods there is unknown magic on hathegkla for the
   screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter and the slopes
   of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither i am
   plunging hei! hei! at last! in the dim light i behold the gods of
   earth!

   and now atal slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps heard in
   the dark a loathsome laughing mixed with such a cry as no man else
   ever heard save in the phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry
   wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime
   packed into one atrocious moment:

   the other gods! the other gods! the gods of the outer hells that guard
   the feeble gods of earth! look away go back do not see! do not
   see! the vengeance of the infinite abysses that cursed that
   damnable pit merciful gods of earth i am falling into the sky!

   and as atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump
   downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights there
   resounded on hathegkla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the
   good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of hatheg nir and
   ulthar and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange
   eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted and when the moon came
   out at last atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without
   sight of earths gods or of the other gods

   now it is told in the moldy pnakotic manuscripts that sansu found
   naught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb hathegkla in the
   youth of the world yet when the men of ulthar and nir and hatheg
   crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of
   barzai the wise they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a
   curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide as if the rock had been
   riven by some titanic chisel and the symbol was like to one that
   learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the pnakotic
   manuscripts which were too ancient to be read this they found

   barzai the wise they never found nor could the holy priest atal ever
   be persuaded to pray for his souls repose moreover to this day the
   people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses and pray by night
   when pale vapors hide the mountaintop and the moon and above the
   mists on hathegkla earths gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for
   they know they are safe and love to come from unknown kadath in ships
   of clouds and play in the olden way as they did when earth was new and
   men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places

   1336974the outposthp lovecraft

   when evening cools the yellow stream
         and shadows stalk the jungles ways
         zimbabwes palace flares ablaze
   for a great king who fears to dream
   for he alone of all mankind
         waded the swamp that serpents shun;
         and struggling toward the setting sun
   came on the veldt that lies behind
   no other eyes had vented there
         since eyes were lent for human sight
         but there as sunset turned to night
   he found the elder secrets lair
   strange turrets rose beyond the plain
         and walls and bastions spread around
         the distant domes that fouled the ground
   like leprous fungi after rain
   a grudging moon writhed up to shine
         past leagues where life can have no home;
         and paling faroff tower and dome
   shewed each unwindowed and malign
   then he who in his boyhood ran
         through vinehung ruins free of fear
         trembled at what he sawfor here
   was no dead ruined seat of man
   inhuman shapes halfseen halfguessed
         half solid and half etherspawned
         seethed down from starless voids that yawned
   in heavn to these blank walls of pest
   and voidward from that pestmad zone
         amorphous hordes seethed darkly back
         their dim claws laden with the wrack
   of things that men have dreamed and known
   the ancient fishers from outside
         were there not tales the highpriest told
         of how they found the worlds of old
   and took what pelf their fancy spied?
   their hidden dreadringed outposts brood
         upon a million worlds of space;
         abhorred by every living race
   yet scatheless in their solitude
   sweating with fright the watcher crept
         back to the swamp that serpents shun
         so that he lay by rise of sun
   safe in the palace where he slept
   none saw him leave or come at dawn
         nor does his flesh bear any mark
         of what he met in that curst dark
   yet from his sleep all peace has gone
   when evening cools the yellow stream
         and shadows stalk the jungles ways
         zimbabwes palace flares ablaze
   for a great king who fears to dream

   unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and
   sadness wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and
   dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique
   books or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque gigantic
   and vineencumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far
   aloft such a lot the gods gave to meto me the dazed the
   disappointed; the barren the broken and yet i am strangely content
   and cling desperately to those sere memories when my mind momentarily
   threatens to reach beyond to the other

   i know not where i was born save that the castle was infinitely old
   and infinitely horrible full of dark passages and having high ceilings
   where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows the stones in the
   crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp and there was an
   accursed smell everywhere as of the piledup corpses of dead
   generations it was never light so that i used sometimes to light
   candles and gaze steadily at them for relief nor was there any sun
   outdoors since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost
   accessible tower there was one black tower which reached above the
   trees into the unknown outer sky but that was partly ruined and could
   not be ascended save by a wellnigh impossible climb up the sheer wall
   stone by stone

   i must have lived years in this place but i cannot measure the time
   beings must have cared for my needs yet i cannot recall any person
   except myself or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and
   spiders i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged
   since my first conception of a living person was that of somebody
   mockingly like myself yet distorted shrivelled and decaying like the
   castle to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons
   that strewed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations
   i fantastically associated these things with everyday events and
   thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings
   which i found in many of the mouldy books from such books i learned
   all that i know no teacher urged or guided me and i do not recall
   hearing any human voice in all those yearsnot even my own; for
   although i had read of speech i had never thought to try to speak
   aloud my aspect was a matter equally unthought of for there were no
   mirrors in the castle and i merely regarded myself by instinct as akin
   to the youthful figures i saw drawn and painted in the books i felt
   conscious of youth because i remembered so little

   outside across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees i would
   often lie and dream for hours about what i read in the books; and would
   longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond
   the endless forests once i tried to escape from the forest but as i
   went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more
   filled with brooding fear; so that i ran frantically back lest i lose
   my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence

   so through endless twilights i dreamed and waited though i knew not
   what i waited for then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light
   grew so frantic that i could rest no more and i lifted entreating
   hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest
   into the unknown outer sky and at last i resolved to scale that tower
   fall though i might; since it were better to glimpse the sky and
   perish than to live without ever beholding day

   in the dank twilight i climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till i
   reached the level where they ceased and thereafter clung perilously to
   small footholds leading upward ghastly and terrible was that dead
   stairless cylinder of rock; black ruined and deserted and sinister
   with startled bats whose wings made no noise but more ghastly and
   terrible still was the slowness of my progress; for climb as i might
   the darkness overhead grew no thinner and a new chill as of haunted
   and venerable mould assailed me i shivered as i wondered why i did not
   reach the light and would have looked down had i dared i fancied that
   night had come suddenly upon me and vainly groped with one free hand
   for a window embrasure that i might peer out and above and try to
   judge the height i had once attained

   all at once after an infinity of awesome sightless crawling up that
   concave and desperate precipice i felt my head touch a solid thing
   and i knew i must have gained the roof or at least some kind of floor
   in the darkness i raised my free hand and tested the barrier finding
   it stone and immovable then came a deadly circuit of the tower
   clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my
   testing hand found the barrier yielding and i turned upward again
   pushing the slab or door with my head as i used both hands in my
   fearful ascent there was no light revealed above and as my hands went
   higher i knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was
   the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater
   circumference than the lower tower no doubt the floor of some lofty
   and capacious observation chamber i crawled through carefully and
   tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place but
   failed in the latter attempt as i lay exhausted on the stone floor i
   heard the eerie echoes of its fall hoped when necessary to pry it up
   again

   believing i was now at prodigious height far above the accursed
   branches of the wood i dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled
   about for windows that i might look for the first time upon the sky
   and the moon and stars of which i had read but on every hand i was
   disappointed; since all that i found were vast shelves of marble
   bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size more and more i
   reflected and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high
   apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below then
   unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway where hung a portal of
   stone rough with strange chiselling trying it i found it locked; but
   with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged
   it open inward as i did so there came to me the purest ecstasy i have
   ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron
   and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly
   found doorway was the radiant full moon which i had never before seen
   save in dreams and in vague visions i dared not call memories

   fancying now that i had attained the very pinnacle of the castle i
   commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden
   veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble and i felt my way
   more slowly in the dark it was still very dark when i reached the
   gratingwhich i tried carefully and found unlocked but which i did
   not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which i had
   climbed then the moon came out

   most demoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and
   grotesquely unbelievable nothing i had before undergone could compare
   in terror with what i now saw; with the bizarre marvels that sight
   implied the sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying for it
   was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a
   lofty eminence there stretched around me on the level through the
   grating nothing less than the solid ground decked and diversified by
   marble slabs and columns and overshadowed by an ancient stone church
   whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight

   half unconscious i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white
   gravel path that stretched away in two directions my mind stunned and
   chaotic as it was still held the frantic craving for light; and not
   even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course i
   neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity dreaming or
   magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost
   i knew not who i was or what i was or what my surroundings might be;
   though as i continued to stumble along i became conscious of a kind of
   fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous i
   passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns and
   wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible
   road but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where
   only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road
   once i swam across a swift river where crumbling mossy masonry told of
   a bridge long vanished

   over two hours must have passed before i reached what seemed to be my
   goal a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park maddeningly
   familiar yet full of perplexing strangeness to me i saw that the moat
   was filled in and that some of the wellknown towers were demolished
   whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder but what i observed
   with chief interest and delight were the open windowsgorgeously
   ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry
   advancing to one of these i looked in and saw an oddly dressed company
   indeed; making merry and speaking brightly to one another i had
   never seemingly heard human speech before and could guess only
   vaguely what was said some of the faces seemed to hold expressions
   that brought up incredibly remote recollections others were utterly
   alien

   i now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room
   stepping as i did so from my single bright moment of hope to my
   blackest convulsion of despair and realization the nightmare was quick
   to come for as i entered there occurred immediately one of the most
   terrifying demonstrations i had ever conceived scarcely had i crossed
   the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and
   unheralded fear of hideous intensity distorting every face and evoking
   the most horrible screams from nearly every throat flight was
   universal and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and
   were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions many covered their
   eyes with their hands and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race
   to escape overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before
   they managed to reach one of the many doors

   the cries were shocking; and as i stood in the brilliant apartment
   alone and dazed listening to their vanishing echoes i trembled at the
   thought of what might be lurking near me unseen at a casual inspection
   the room seemed deserted but when i moved towards one of the alcoves i
   thought i detected a presence therea hint of motion beyond the
   goldenarched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room as
   i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly;
   and then with the first and last sound i ever uttereda ghastly
   ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious causei
   beheld in full frightful vividness the inconceivable indescribable
   and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance
   changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives

   i cannot even hint what it was like for it was a compound of all that
   is unclean uncanny unwelcome abnormal and detestable it was the
   ghoulish shade of decay antiquity and dissolution; the putrid
   dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation the awful baring of that
   which the merciful earth should always hide god knows it was not of
   this worldor no longer of this worldyet to my horror i saw in its
   eatenaway and bonerevealing outlines a leering abhorrent travesty on
   the human shape; and in its mouldy disintegrating apparel an
   unspeakable quality that chilled me even more

   i was almost paralysed but not too much so to make a feeble effort
   towards flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in
   which the nameless voiceless monster held me my eyes bewitched by the
   glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them refused to close;
   though they were mercifully blurred and showed the terrible object but
   indistinctly after the first shock i tried to raise my hand to shut
   out the sight yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not
   fully obey my will the attempt however was enough to disturb my
   balance; so that i had to stagger forward several steps to avoid
   falling as i did so i became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the
   nearness of the carrion thing whose hideous hollow breathing i half
   fancied i could hear nearly mad i found myself yet able to throw out
   a hand to ward off the foetid apparition which pressed so close; when
   in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish
   accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster
   beneath the golden arch

   i did not shriek but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind
   shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind
   a single fleeting avalanche of soulannihilating memory i knew in that
   second all that had been; i remembered beyond the frightful castle and
   the trees and recognized the altered edifice in which i now stood; i
   recognized most terrible of all the unholy abomination that stood
   leering before me as i withdrew my sullied fingers from its own

   but in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness and that balm is
   nepenthe in the supreme horror of that second i forgot what had
   horrified me and the burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of
   echoing images in a dream i fled from that haunted and accursed pile
   and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight when i returned to the
   churchyard place of marble and went down the steps i found the stone
   trapdoor immovable; but i was not sorry for i had hated the antique
   castle and the trees now i ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls
   on the nightwind and play by day amongst the catacombs of nephrenka
   in the sealed and unknown valley of hadoth by the nile i know that
   light is not for me save that of the moon over the rock tombs of neb
   nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of nitokris beneath the great
   pyramid; yet in my new wildness and freedom i almost welcome the
   bitterness of alienage

   for although nepenthe has calmed me i know always that i am an
   outsider; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men
   this i have known ever since i stretched out my fingers to the
   abomination within that great gilded frame; stretched out my fingers
   and touched a cold and unyielding surface of polished glass

   12312the peace advocateh p lovecraft

   the vicar sat in the firelights glow
   a volume in his hand
   and a tear he shed for the widespread woe
   and the anguish brought by the vicious foe
   that overran the land

   but never a hand for his king raised he
   for he was a man of peace;
   and he card not a whit for the victory
   that must come to preserve his nation free
   and the world from fear release

   his son had buckled on his sword
   the first at the front was he
   but the vicar his valiant child ignord
   and his noble deeds in the field deplord
   for he knew not bravery

   on his flock he strove to fix his will
   and lead them to scorn the fray
   he told them that conquest brings but ill;
   that meek submission would serve them still
   to keep the foe away

   in vain did he hear the bugles sound
   that strove to avert the fall
   the land quoth he is all mens ground
   what matter if friend or foe be found
   as master of us all?

   one day from the village green hard by
   the vicar heard a roar
   of cannon that rivald the anguishd cry
   of the hundreds that livd but wishd to die
   as the enemy rode them oer

   now he sees his own cathedral shake
   at the foemens wanton aim
   the ancient towers with the bullets quake;
   the steeples fall the foundations break
   and the whole is lost in flame

   up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade
   and the vicar and daughter and wife
   scream out in vain for the needed aid
   that only a regiment might have made
   ere they lose what is more than life

   then quick to his brain came manhoods thought
   as he saw his erring course
   and the vicar his dusty rifle brought
   that the foe might at least by one be fought
   and force repaid with force

   one shot  the enemys blasting fire
   a breach in the wall cuts through
   but the vicar replies with his wakened ire;
   fells one armd brute for each fallen spire
   and in blood is born anew

   two shots  the wife and daughter sink
   each with a mortal wound
   and the vicar too maddend by far to think
   rushes boldly on to deaths vague brink
   with the manhood he has found

   three shots  but shots of another kind
   the smoky regions rend
   and upon the foemen with rage gone blind
   like a ceaseless resistless avenging wind
   the rescuing troops descend

   the smokepall clears and the vicars son
   his fathers life has savd
   and the vicar looks oer ruin done
   ere the victory by his child was won
   his face with care engravd

   the vicar sat in the firelights glow
   the volume in his hand
   that brought to his hearth the bitter woe
   which only a husband and father can know
   and truly understand

   with a chastend mien he flung the book
   to the leaping flames before
   and a breath of sad relief he took
   as the pages blackend beneath his look 
   the fool of peace no more!

   epilogue

   the reverend parson wakd to mans estate
   laments his wifes and daughters common fate
   his martial son in warm embrace enfolds
   and clings the tighter to the child he holds:
   his peaceful notions banishd in an hour
   will nevermore his wit or sense devour
   but steepd in truth `tis now his nobler plan
   to cure yet recognize the faults of man

   searchers after horror haunt strange far places for them are the
   catacombs of ptolemais and the carven mausolea of the nightmare
   countries they climb to the moonlit towers of ruined rhine castles
   and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of
   forgotten cities in asia the haunted wood and the desolate mountain
   are their shrines and they linger around the sinister monoliths on
   uninhabited islands but the true epicure in the terrible to whom a
   new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and
   justification of existence esteems most of all the ancient lonely
   farmhouses of backwoods new england; for there the dark elements of
   strength solitude grotesqueness and ignorance combine to form the
   perfection of the hideous

   most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses
   remote from travelled ways usually squatted upon some damp grassy
   slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock two hundred
   years and more they have leaned or squatted there while the vines have
   crawled and the trees have swelled and spread they are almost hidden
   now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but
   the smallpaned windows still stare shockingly as if blinking through
   a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of
   unutterable things

   in such houses have dwelt generations of strange people whose like the
   world has never seen seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which
   exiled them from their kind their ancestors sought the wilderness for
   freedom there the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free
   from the restrictions of their fellows but cowered in an appalling
   slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds divorced from the
   enlightenment of civilization the strength of these puritans turned
   into singular channels; and in their isolation morbid selfrepression
   and struggle for life with relentless nature there came to them dark
   furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold northern
   heritage by necessity practical and by philosophy stern these folks
   were not beautiful in their sins erring as all mortals must they were
   forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that
   they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed only the
   silent sleepy staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has
   lain hidden since the early days and they are not communicative being
   loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget sometimes
   one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses for they
   must often dream

   it was to a timebattered edifice of this description that i was driven
   one afternoon in november 1896 by a rain of such chilling copiousness
   that any shelter was preferable to exposure i had been travelling for
   some time amongst the people of the miskatonic valley in quest of
   certain genealogical data; and from the remote devious and
   problematical nature of my course had deemed it convenient to employ a
   bicycle despite the lateness of the season now i found myself upon an
   apparently abandoned road which i had chosen as the shortest cut to
   arkham overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town and
   confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden
   building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge
   leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill distant though it is from
   the remnant of a road this house none the less impressed me
   unfavorably the very moment i espied it honest wholesome structures
   do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly and in my
   genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before
   which biased me against places of this kind yet the force of the
   elements was such as to overcome my scruples and i did not hesitate to
   wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at
   once so suggestive and secretive

   i had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned yet as
   i approached it i was not so sure for though the walks were indeed
   overgrown with weeds they seemed to retain their nature a little too
   well to argue complete desertion therefore instead of trying the door
   i knocked feeling as i did so a trepidation i could scarcely explain
   as i waited on the rough mossy rock which served as a doorstep i
   glanced at the neighboring windows and the panes of the transom above
   me and noticed that although old rattling and almost opaque with
   dirt they were not broken the building then must still be
   inhabited despite its isolation and general neglect however my
   rapping evoked no response so after repeating the summons i tried the
   rusty latch and found the door unfastened inside was a little
   vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling and through
   the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odor i entered
   carrying my bicycle and closed the door behind me ahead rose a narrow
   staircase flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar
   while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the
   ground floor

   leaning my cycle against the wall i opened the door at the left and
   crossed into a small lowceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two
   dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible
   way it appeared to be a kind of sittingroom for it had a table and
   several chairs and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique
   clock on a mantel books and papers were very few and in the
   prevailing gloom i could not readily discern the titles what
   interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every
   visible detail most of the houses in this region i had found rich in
   relics of the past but here the antiquity was curiously complete; for
   in all the room i could not discover a single article of definitely
   postrevolutionary date had the furnishings been less humble the
   place would have been a collectors paradise

   as i surveyed this quaint apartment i felt an increase in that
   aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house just what it
   was that i feared or loathed i could by no means define; but something
   in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age of
   unpleasant crudeness and of secrets which should be forgotten i felt
   disinclined to sit down and wandered about examining the various
   articles which i had noticed the first object of my curiosity was a
   book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an
   antediluvian aspect that i marvelled at beholding it outside a museum
   or library it was bound in leather with metal fittings and was in an
   excellent state of preservation; being altogether an unusual sort of
   volume to encounter in an abode so lowly when i opened it to the title
   page my wonder grew even greater for it proved to be nothing less rare
   than pigafettas account of the congo region written in latin from the
   notes of the sailor lopex and printed at frankfurt in 1598 i had often
   heard of this work with its curious illustrations by the brothers de
   bry hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the
   pages before me the engravings were indeed interesting drawn wholly
   from imagination and careless descriptions and represented negroes
   with white skins and caucasian features; nor would i soon have closed
   the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired
   nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet what annoyed me was merely
   the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at
   plate xii which represented in gruesome detail a butchers shop of the
   cannibal anziques i experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so
   slight a thing but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me especially
   in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of anzique
   gastronomy

   i had turned to a neighboring shelf and was examining its meagre
   literary contents  an eighteenth century bible a pilgrims progress
   of like period illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the
   almanackmaker isaiah thomas the rotting bulk of cotton mathers
   magnalia christi americana and a few other books of evidently equal
   age  when my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of
   walking in the room overhead at first astonished and startled
   considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door i
   immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from
   a sound sleep and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded
   on the creaking stairs the tread was heavy yet seemed to contain a
   curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which i disliked the more
   because the tread was heavy when i had entered the room i had shut the
   door behind me now after a moment of silence during which the walker
   may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall i heard a fumbling at
   the latch and saw the paneled portal swing open again

   in the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that i should
   have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding old
   whitebearded and ragged my host possessed a countenance and physique
   which inspired equal wonder and respect his height could not have been
   less than six feet and despite a general air of age and poverty he was
   stout and powerful in proportion his face almost hidden by a long
   beard which grew high on the cheeks seemed abnormally ruddy and less
   wrinkled than one might expect; while over a high forehead fell a shock
   of white hair little thinned by the years his blue eyes though a
   trifle bloodshot seemed inexplicably keen and burning but for his
   horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguishedlooking
   as he was impressive this unkemptness however made him offensive
   despite his face and figure of what his clothing consisted i could
   hardly tell for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters
   surmounting a pair of high heavy boots; and his lack of cleanliness
   surpassed description

   the appearance of this man and the instinctive fear he inspired
   prepared me for something like enmity; so that i almost shuddered
   through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me
   to a chair and addressed me in a thin weak voice full of fawning
   respect and ingratiating hospitality his speech was very curious an
   extreme form of yankee dialect i had thought long extinct; and i
   studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversation

   ketched in the rain be ye? he greeted glad ye was nigh the haouse
   en hed the sense ta come right in i calclate i was alseep else id
   a heerd yei aint as young as i uster be an i need a paowerful sight
   o naps naowadays travlin fur? i haint seed many folks long this
   rud sence they tuk off the arkham stage

   i replied that i was going to arkham and apologized for my rude entry
   into his domicile whereupon he continued

   glad ta see ye young sir  new faces is scurce arount here an i
   haint got much ta cheer me up these days guess yew hail from bosting
   dont ye? i never ben thar but i kin tell a taown man when i see im 
   we hed one fer deestrick schoolmaster in eightyfour but he quit
   suddent an no one never heerd on im sence   here the old man lapsed
   into a kind of chuckle and made no explanation when i questioned him
   he seemed to be in an aboundingly good humor yet to possess those
   eccentricities which one might guess from his grooming for some time
   he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality when it struck me to
   ask him how he came by so rare a book as pigafettas regnum congo
   the effect of this volume had not left me and i felt a certain
   hesitancy in speaking of it but curiosity overmastered all the vague
   fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the
   house to my relief the question did not seem an awkward one for the
   old man answered freely and volubly

   oh that afriky book? capn ebenezer holt traded me thet in
   sixtyeight  him as was kilt in the war something about the name of
   ebenezer holt caused me to look up sharply i had encountered it in my
   genealogical work but not in any record since the revolution i
   wondered if my host could help me in the task at which i was laboring
   and resolved to ask him about it later on he continued

   ebenezer was on a salem merchantman for years an picked up a sight
   o queer stuff in every port he got this in london i guess  he uster
   like ter buy things at the shops i was up ta his haouse onct on the
   hill tradin hosses when i see this book i relished the picters so
   he give it in on a swap tis a queer book  here leave me git on my
   spectacles the old man fumbled among his rags producing a pair of
   dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and
   steel bows donning these he reached for the volume on the table and
   turned the pages lovingly

   ebenezer cud read a leetle o thistis latin  but i cant i had two
   er three schoolmasters read me a bit and passon clark him they say
   got draownded in the pond  kin yew make anything outen it? i told him
   that i could and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the
   beginning if i erred he was not scholar enough to correct me; for he
   seemed childishly pleased at my english version his proximity was
   becoming rather obnoxious yet i saw no way to escape without offending
   him i was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant old man for
   the pictures in a book he could not read and wondered how much better
   he could read the few books in english which adorned the room this
   revelation of simplicity removed much of the illdefined apprehension i
   had felt and i smiled as my host rambled on:

   queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin take this un here near the
   front hey yew ever seed trees like thet with big leaves a floppin
   over an daown? and them men  them cant be niggers  they dew beat
   all kinder like injuns i guess even ef they be in afriky some o
   these here critters looks like monkeys or half monkeys an half men
   but i never heerd o nothin like this un here he pointed to a
   fabulous creature of the artist which one might describe as a sort of
   dragon with the head of an alligator

   but naow ill show ye the best un  over here nigh the middle  the
   old mans speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter
   glow; but his fumbling hands though seemingly clumsier than before
   were entirely adequate to their mission the book fell open almost of
   its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place to
   the repellent twelfth plate showing a butchers shop amongst the
   anzique cannibals my sense of restlessness returned though i did not
   exhibit it the especially bizarre thing was that the artist had made
   his africans look like white men  the limbs and quarters hanging about
   the walls of the shop were ghastly while the butcher with his axe was
   hideously incongruous but my host seemed to relish the view as much as
   i disliked it

   what dye think o this  aint never see the like hereabouts eh?
   when i see this i telled eb holt thats suthin ta stir ye up an
   make yer blood tickle when i read in scripter about slayin  like
   them midianites was slew  i kinder think things but i aint got no
   picter of it here a body kin see all they is to it  i spose tis
   sinful but aint we all born an livin in sin?  thet feller bein
   chopped up gives me a tickle every time i look at im  i hey ta keep
   lookin at im  see whar the butcher cut off his feet? thars his head
   on thet bench with one arm side of it an tother arms on the other
   side o the meat block

   as the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his
   hairy spectacled face became indescribable but his voice sank rather
   than mounted my own sensations can scarcely be recorded all the
   terror i had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly and
   i knew that i loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me
   with an infinite intensity his madness or at least his partial
   perversion seemed beyond dispute he was almost whispering now with a
   huskiness more terrible than a scream and i trembled as i listened

   as i says tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin dye know young
   sir im right sot on this un here arter i got the book off eb i uster
   look at it a lot especial when id heerd passon clark rant o sundays
   in his big wig onct i tried suthin funny  here young sir dont git
   skeert  all i done was ter look at the picter afore i kilt the sheep
   for market  killin sheep was kinder more fun arter lookin at it  
   the tone of the old man now sank very low sometimes becoming so faint
   that his words were hardly audible i listened to the rain and to the
   rattling of the bleared smallpaned windows and marked a rumbling of
   approaching thunder quite unusual for the season once a terrific flash
   and peal shook the frail house to its foundations but the whisperer
   seemed not to notice it

   killin sheep was kinder more fun  but dye know twant quite
   satisfyin queer haow a cravin gits a holt on ye  as ye love the
   almighty young man dont tell nobody but i swar ter gawd thet picter
   begun to make me hungry fer victuals i couldnt raise nor buy  here
   set still whats ailin ye?  i didnt do nothin only i wondered
   haow twud be ef i did  they say meat makes blood an flesh an gives
   ye new life so i wondered ef twudnt make a man live longer an
   longer ef twas more the same   but the whisperer never continued
   the interruption was not produced by my fright nor by the rapidly
   increasing storm amidst whose fury i was presently to open my eyes on a
   smoky solitude of blackened ruins it was produced by a very simple
   though somewhat unusual happening

   the open book lay flat between us with the picture staring repulsively
   upward as the old man whispered the words more the same a tiny
   splattering impact was heard and something showed on the yellowed
   paper of the upturned volume i thought of the rain and of a leaky
   roof but rain is not red on the butchers shop of the anzique
   cannibals a small red spattering glistened picturesquely lending
   vividness to the horror of the engraving the old man saw it and
   stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it
   necessary; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he
   had left an hour before i followed his glance and beheld just above
   us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot
   of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as i viewed it i did not
   shriek or move but merely shut my eyes a moment later came the
   titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed house of
   unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my
   mind

                                   a fable

                      luxus tumultus semper causa est

   lucullus languish student of the skies
   and connoisseur of rarebits and mince pies
   a bard by choice a grocers clerk by trade
   (grown pessimist through honours long delayd)
   a secret yearning bore that he might shine
   in breathing numbers and in song divine
   each day his fountain pen was wont to drop
   an ode or dirge or two about the shop
   yet naught could strike the chord within his heart
   that throbbd for poesy and cryd for art
   each eve he sought his bashful muse to wake
   with overdoses of ice cream and cake
   but though thambitious youth a dreamer grew
   th aonian nymph delcind to come to view

   something at dusk he scourd the heavns afar
   searching for raptures in the evening star;
   one night he strove to catch a tale untold
   in crystal deeps  but only caught a cold
   so pind lucullus with his lofty woe
   till one drear day he bought a set of poe:
   charmd with the cheerful horrors there displays
   he vowd with gloom to woo the heavnly maid
   of aubers tarn and yaaneks slope he dreams
   and weaves an hundred ravens in his schemes
   not far from our young heros peaceful home
   lies the fair grove wherein he loves to roam
   though but a stunted copse in vacant lot
   he dubs it tempe and adores the spot;
   when shallow puddles dot the wooded plain
   and brim oer muddy banks with muddy rain
   he calls them limpid lakes or poison pools
   (depending on which bard his fancy rules)
   tis here he comes with heliconian fire
   on sundays when he smites the attic lyre;
   and here one afternoon he brought his gloom
   resolvd to chant a poets lay of doom
   rogets thesaurus and a book of rhymes
   provide the rungs whereon his spirit climbs:
   with this grave retinue he trod the grove
   and prayd the fauns he might a poeet prove
   but sad to tell ere pegasus flew high
   the not unrelishd supper hour drew nigh;
   our tuneful swain thimperious call attends
   and soon above the groaning table bends
   though it were too prosaic to relate
   th exact particulars of what he ate
   (such longdrawn lists the hasty reader skips
   like homers wellknown catalogue of ships)
   this much we swear: that as adjournment neard
   a monstrous lot of cake had disappeard!
   soon to his chamber the young bard repairs
   and courts soft somnus with sweet lydian airs;
   through open casement scans the starstrown deep
   and neath orions beams sinks off to sleep

   now start from airy dell the elfin train
   that dance each midnight oer the sleeping plain
   to bless the just or cast a warning spell
   on those who dine not wisely but too well
   first deacon smith they plague whose nasal glow
   comes from what holmes hath calld elixir pro;
   groupd round the couch his visage they deride
   whilst through his dreams unnumberd serpents glide
   next troop the little folk into the room
   where snore our young endymion swathd in gloom:
   a smile lights up his boyish face whilst he
   dreams of the moon  or what he ate at tea
   the chieftain elf th unconscious youth surveys
   and on his form a strange enchantment lays:
   those lips that lately trilld with frosted cake
   uneasy sounds in slumbrous fashion make;
   at length their owners fancies they rehearse
   and lisp this awesome poeem in blank verse:

                             aletheia phrikodes

                 omnia risus et omnia pulvis et omnia nihil

   demoniac clouds uppild in chasmy reach
   of soundless heavn smotherd the brooding night;
   nor came the wonted whisprings of the swamp
   nor voice of autumn wind along the moor
   nor mutterd noises of th insomnious grove
   whose black recesses never saw the sun
   within that grove a hideous hollow lies
   half bare of trees; a pool in centre lurks
   that none dares sound; a tarn of murky face
   (though naught can prove its hue since light of day
   affrighted shuns the forestshadows banks)
   hard by a yawning hillside grotto breathes
   from deeps unvisited a dull dank air
   that sears the leaves on certain stunted trees
   which stand about clawing the spectral gloom
   with evil boughs to this accursed dell
   come woodland creatures seldom to depart:
   once i behold upon a crumbling stone
   set altarlike before the cave a thing
   i saw not clearly yet from glimpsing fled
   in this halfdusk i meditate alone
   at many a weary noontide when without
   a world forgets me in its sunblest mirth
   here howls by night the werewolves and the souls
   of those that knew me well in other days
   yet on this night the grove spake not to me;
   nor spake the swamp nor wind along the moor
   nor moand the wind about the lonely eaves
   of the bleak haunted pile wherein i lay
   i was afraid to sleep or quench the spark
   of the lowburning taper by my couch
   i was afraid when through the vaulted space
   of the old towr the clockticks died away
   into a silence so profound and chill
   that my teeth chatterd  giving yet no sound
   then flickerd low the light and all dissolvd
   leaving me floating in the hellish grasp
   of bodyd blackness from whose beating wings
   came ghoulish blasts of charnelscented mist
   things vague unseen unfashiond and unnamd
   jostled each other in the seething void
   that gapd chaotic downward to a sea
   of speechless horror foul with writhing thoughts
   all this i felt and felt the mocking eyes
   of the curss universe upon my soul;
   yet naught i saw nor heard till flashd a beam
   of lurid lustre through the rotting heavns
   playing on scenes i labourd not to see
   methought the nameless tarn alight at last
   reflected shapes and more reveald within
   those shocking depths that neer were seen before;
   methought from out the cave a demon train
   grinning and smirking reeld in fiendish rout;
   bearing within their reeking paws a load
   of carrion viands for an impious feast
   methought the stunted trees with hungry arms
   gropd greedily for things i dare not name;
   the while a stifling wraithlike noisomeness
   filld all the dale and spoke a larger life
   of uncorporeal hideousness awake
   in the halfsentient wholeness of the spot
   now glowd the ground and tarn and cave and trees
   and moving forms and things not spoken of
   with such a phosphorescence as men glimpse
   in the putrescent thickets of the swamp
   where logs decaying lie and rankness reigns
   methought a firemist drapd with lucent fold
   the wellrememberd features of the grove
   whilst whirling ether bore in eddying streams
   the hot unfinishd stuff of nascent worlds
   hither and thither through infinity
   of light and darkness strangely intermixd;
   wherein all entity had consciousness
   without th accustomd outward shape of life
   of these swift circling currents was my soul
   free from the flesh a true constituent part;
   nor felt i less myself for want of form
   then cleard the mist and oer a starstrown scene
   divine and measureless i gazd in awe
   alone in space i viewd a feeble fleck
   of silvern light marking the narrow ken
   which mortals call the boundless universe
   on evry side each as a tiny star
   shone more creations vaster than our own
   and teeming with unnumberd forms of life;
   though we as life would recognize it not
   being bound to earthy thoughts of human mould
   as on a moonless night the milky way
   in solid sheen displays its countless orbs
   to weak terrestrial eyes each orb a sun;
   so beamd the prospect on my wondring soul;
   a spangled curtain rich with twinkling gems
   yet each a mighty universe of suns
   but as i gazd i sensd a spirit voice
   in speech didactic though no voice it was
   save as it carried thought it bade me mark
   that all the universes in my view
   formd but an atom in infinity;
   whose reaches pass the etherladen realms
   of heat and light extending to far fields
   where flourish worlds invisible and vague
   filld with strange wisdom and uncanny life
   and yet beyond; to myriad spheres of light
   to spheres of darkness to abysmal voids
   that know the pulses of disorderd force
   big with these musings i surveyd the surge
   of boundless being yet i usd not eyes
   for spirit leans not on the props of sense
   the docent presence swelld my strength of soul;
   all things i knew but knew with mind alone
   times endless vista spread before my thought
   with its vast pageant of unceasing change
   and sempiternal strife of force and will;
   i saw the ages flow in stately stream
   past rise and fall of universe and life;
   i saw the birth of suns and worlds their death
   their transmutation into limpid flame
   their second birth and second death their course
   perpetual through the aeons termless flight
   never the same yet born again to serve
   the varying purpose of omnipotence
   and whilst i watchd i knew each seconds space
   was greater than the lifetime of our world
   then turnd my musings to that speck of dust
   whereon my form corporeal took its rise;
   that speck born but a second which must die
   in one brief second more; that fragile earth;
   that crude experiment; that cosmic sport
   which holds our proud aspiring race of mites
   and moral vermin; those presuming mites
   whom ignorance with empty pomp adorns
   and misinstructs in specious dignity;
   those mites who reasning outward vaunt themselves
   as the chief work of nature and enjoy
   in fatuous fancy the particular care
   of all her mystic superregnant powr
   and as i strove to vision the sad sphere
   which lurkd lost in ethereal vortices;
   methough my soul tund to the infinite
   refusd to glimpse that poor atomic blight;
   that misbegotten accident of space;
   that globe of insignificance whereon
   (my guide celestial told me) dwells no part
   of empyreal virtue but where breed
   the coarse corruptions of divine disease;
   the festring ailments of infinity;
   the morbid matter by itself calld man:
   such matter (said my guide) as oft breaks forth
   on broad creations fabric to annoy
   for a brief instant ere assuaging death
   heal up the malady its birth provokd
   sickend i turnd my heavy thoughts away
   then spake th ethereal guide with mocking mien
   upbraiding me for searching after truth;
   visiting on my mind the searing scorn
   of mind superior; laughing at the woe
   which rent the vital essence of my soul
   methought he brought remembrance of the time
   when from my fellows to the grove i strayd
   in solitude and dusk to meditate
   on things forbidden and to pierce the veil
   of seeming good and seeming beauteousness
   that covers oer the tragedy of truth
   helping mankind forget his sorry lot
   and raising hope where truth would crush it down
   he spake and as he ceasd methought the flames
   of fuming heavn revolvd in torments dire;
   whirling in maelstroms of revellious might
   yet ever bound by laws i fathomd not
   cycles and epicycles of such girth
   that each a cosmos seemd dazzled my gaze
   till all a wild phantasmal flow became
   now burst athwart the fulgent formlessness
   a rift of purer sheen a sight supernal
   broader that all the void conceivd by man
   yet narrow here a glimpse of heavns beyond;
   of weird creations so remote and great
   that evn my guide assumd a tone of awe
   borne on the wings of stark immensity
   a touch of rhythm celestial reachd my soul;
   thrilling me more with horror than with joy
   again the spirit mockd my human pangs
   and deep revild me for presumptuous thoughts;
   yet changing now his mien he bade me scan
   the widning rift that clave the walls of space;
   he bade me search it for the ultimate;
   he bade me find the truth i sought so long;
   he bade me brave th unutterable thing
   the final truth of moving entity
   all this he bade and offerd  but my soul
   clinging to life fled without aim or knowledge
   shrieking in silence through the gibbering deeps

                                      

   thus shriekd the young lucullus as he fled
   through gibbering deeps  and tumbled out of bed;
   within the room the morning sunshine gleams
   whilst the poor youth recalls his troubled dreams
   he feels his aching limbs whose woeful pain
   informs his soul his body lives again
   and thanks his stars  or cosmoses  or such 
   that he survives the noxious nightmares clutch
   thrilld with the music of th eternal spheres
   (or is it the alarmclock that he hears?)
   he vows to all the pantheon high and low
   no more to feed on cake or pie or poe
   and now his gloomy spirits seem to rise
   as he the world beholds with clearer eyes;
   the cup he thought too full of dregs to quaff
   affords him wine enough to raise a laugh
   (all this is metaphor  you must not think
   our late endymion prone to stronger drink!)
   with brighter visage and with lighter heart
   he turns his fancies to the grocers mart;
   and strange to say at last he seems to find
   his daily duties worthy of his mind
   since truth provd such a high and dangrous goal
   our bard seeks one less trying to his soul;
   with deepdrawn breath he flouts his dreary woes
   and a good clerk from a bad poet grows!
   now close attend my lay ye scribbling crew
   that bay the moon in numbers strange and new;
   that madly for the spark celestial bawl
   in metres short or long or none at all;
   curb your rash force in numbers or at tea
   nor overzealous for high fancies be;
   reflect ere ye the draught pierian take
   what worthy clerks or plumbers ye might make;
   wax not too frenzied in the leaping line
   that neither sense nor measure can confine
   lest ye like young lucullus launguish groan
   beneath poeetic nightmares of your own!

   the quest of iranon  (1921)
   by h p lovecraft
   this work was first published in the july/august 1935 issue of the
   magazine galleon
   8521the quest of iranonh p lovecraft1921

   into the granite city of teloth wandered the youth vinecrowned his
   yellow hair glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers
   of the mountain sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone
   the men of teloth are dark and stern and dwell in square houses and
   with frowns they asked the stranger whence he had come and what were
   his name and fortune so the youth answered:

   i am iranon and come from aira a far city that i recall only dimly
   but seek to find again i am a singer of songs that i learned in the
   far city and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered
   of childhood my wealth is in little memories and dreams and in hopes
   that i sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs
   the lotusbuds

   when the men of teloth heard these things they whispered to one
   another; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or song
   the stern men sometimes look to the karthian hills in the spring and
   think of the lutes of distant oonai whereof travellers have told and
   thinking thus they bade the stranger stay and sing in the square
   before the tower of mlin though they liked not the colour of his
   tattered robe nor the myrrh in his hair nor his chaplet of
   vineleaves nor the youth in his golden voice at evening iranon sang
   and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a
   nimbus over the singers head but most of the men of teloth yawned
   and some laughed and some went to sleep; for iranon told nothing
   useful singing only his memories his dreams and his hopes

   i remember the twilight the moon and soft songs and the window
   where i was rocked to sleep and through the window was the street
   where the golden lights came and where the shadows danced on houses of
   marble i remember the square of moonlight on the floor that was not
   like any other light and the visions that danced on the moonbeams when
   my mother sang to me and too i remember the sun of morning bright
   above the manycoloured hills in summer and the sweetness of flowers
   borne on the south wind that made the trees sing

   oh aira city of marble and beryl how many are thy beauties! how i
   loved the warm and fragrant groves across the hyline nithra and the
   falls of the tiny kra that flowed though the verdant valley! in those
   groves and in the vale the children wove wreathes for one another and
   at dusk i dreamed strange dreams under the yathtrees on the mountain
   as i saw below me the lights of the city and the curving nithra
   reflecting a ribbon of stars

   and in the city were the palaces of veined and tinted marble with
   golden domes and painted walls and green gardens with cerulean pools
   and crystal fountains often i played in the gardens and waded in the
   pools and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees and
   sometimes at sunset i would climb the long hilly street to the citadel
   and the open place and look down upon aira the magic city of marble
   and beryl splendid in a robe of golden flame

   long have i missed thee aira for i was but young when we went into
   exile; but my father was thy king and i shall come again to thee for
   it is so decreed of fate all through seven lands have i sought thee
   and some day shall i reign over thy groves and gardens thy streets and
   palaces and sing to men who shall know whereof i sing and laugh not
   nor turn away for i am iranon who was a prince in aira

   that night the men of teloth lodged the stranger in a stable and in
   the morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of
   athok the cobbler and be apprenticed to him

   but i am iranon a singer of songs  he said and have no heart for
   the cobblers trade

   all in teloth must toil replied the archon for that is the law
   then said iranon:

   wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? and if
   ye toil only that ye may toil more when shall happiness find you? ye
   toil to live but is not life made of beauty and song? and if ye suffer
   no singers among you where shall be the fruits of your toil? toil
   without song is like a weary journey without an end were not death
   more pleasing? but the archon was sullen and did not understand and
   rebuked the stranger

   thou art a strange youth and i like not thy face nor thy voice the
   words thou speakest are blasphemy for the gods of teloth have said
   that toil is good our gods have promised us a haven of light beyond
   death where shall be rest without end and crystal coldness amidst
   which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty go
   thou then to athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset
   all here must serve and song is folly

   so iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone
   streets between the gloomy square house of granite seeking something
   green for all was of stone on the faces of men were frowns but by
   the stone embankment along the sluggish river zuro sat a young boy with
   sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed
   down from the hills by the freshets and the boy said to him:

   art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell who seekest a far
   city in a fair land? i am romnod and borne of the blood of teloth but
   am not old in the ways of the granite city and yearn daily for the
   warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song beyond the
   karthian hills lieth oonai the city of lutes and dancing which men
   whisper of and say is both lovely and terriblethither would i go were
   i old enough to find the way and thither shouldst thou go and thou
   wouldst sing and have men listen to thee let us leave the city of
   teloth and fare together among the hills of spring thou shalt shew me
   the ways of travel and i will attend thy songs at evening when the
   stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers and
   peradventure it may be that oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even
   the fair aira thou seekest for it is told that thou hast not known
   aira since the old days and a name often changeth let us go to oonai
   o iranon of the golden head where men shall know our longings and
   welcome us as brothers nor even laugh or frown at what we say and
   iranon answered:

   be it so small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he
   must seek the mountains and beyond and i would not leave thee to pine
   by the sluggish zuro but think not that delight and understanding
   dwell just across the karthian hills or in any spot thou canst find in
   a days or a years or a lustrums journey behold when i was small
   like thee i dwelt in the valley of narthos by the frigid xari where
   none would listen to my dreams; and i told myself that when older i
   would go to sinara on the southern slope and sing to smiling
   dromedarymen in the marketplace but when i went to sinara i found the
   dromedarymen all drunken and ribald and saw that their songs were not
   as mine so i travelled in a barge down the xari to onyxwalled jaren
   and the soldiers at jaren laughed at me and drave me out so that i
   wandered to many cities i have seen stethelos that is below the great
   cataract and have gazed on the marsh where sarnath once stood i have
   been to thraa ilarnek and kadatheron on the winding river ai and
   have dwelt long in olathoe in the land of lomar but though i have had
   listeners sometimes they have ever been few and i know that welcome
   shall wait me only in aira the city of marble and beryl where my
   father once ruled as king so for aira shall we seek though it were
   well to visit distant and luteblessed oonai across the karthianhills
   which may indeed be aira though i think not airas beauty is past
   imagining and none can tell of it without rapture whilist of oonai
   the cameldrivers whisper leeringly

   at the sunset iranon and small romnod went forth from teloth and for
   long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests the way was
   rough and obscure and never did they seem nearer to oonai the city of
   lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out iranon would
   sing of aira and its beauties and romnod would listen so that they
   were both happy after a fashion they ate plentifully of fruit and red
   berries and marked not the passing of time but many years must have
   slipped away small romnod was now not so small and spoke deeply
   instead of shrilly though iranon was always the same and decked his
   golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods so it
   came to pass that romnod seemed older than iranon though he had been
   very small when iranon had found him watching for green budding
   branches in teloth beside the sluggish stonebanked zuro

   then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain
   crest and looked down upon the myriad light of oonai peasants had told
   them they were near and iranon knew that this was not his native city
   of aira the lights of oonai were not like those of aira; for they were
   harsh and glaring while the lights of aira shine as softly and
   magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where
   iranons mother once rocked him to sleep with song but oonai was a
   city of lutes and dancing so iranon and romnod went down the steep
   slope that they might find men to whom sings and dreams would bring
   pleasure and when they were come into the town they found
   rosewreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from
   windows and balconies who listened to the songs of iranon and tossed
   him flowers and applauded when he was done then for a moment did
   iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he
   though the town was not a hundredth as fair as aira

   when dawn came iranon looked about with dismay for the domes of oonai
   were not golden in the sun but grey and dismal and the men of oonai
   were pale with revelling and dull with wine and unlike the radient
   men of aira but because the people had thrown him blossoms and
   acclaimed his sings iranon stayed on and with him romnod who liked
   the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle
   often at night iranon sang to the revellers but he was always as
   before crowned only in the vine of the mountains and remembering the
   marble streets of aira and the hyaline nithra in the frescoed halls of
   the monarch did he sing upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that
   was a mirror and as he sang he brought pictures to his hearers till
   the floor seemed to reflect old beautiful and halfremembered things
   instead of the winereddened feasters who pelted him with roses and
   the king bade him put away his tattered purple and clothed him in
   satin and clothofgold with rings of green jade and bracelets of
   tinted ivory and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a
   bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of
   flowerembroidered silk thus dwelt iranon in oonai the city of lutes
   and dancing

   it is not known how long iranon tarried in oonai but one day the king
   brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the liranian
   desert and dusky fluteplayers from drinen in the east and after that
   the revellers threw their roses not so much at iranon as at the dancers
   and fluteplayers and day by day that romnod who had been a small boy
   in granite teloth grew coarser and redder with wine till he dreamed
   less and less amd listened with less delight to the songs of iranon
   but though iranon was sad he ceased not to sing and at evening told
   again of his dreams of aira the city of marble and beryl then one
   night the reddened and fattened romnod snorted heavily amidst the
   poppied silks of his banquetcouch and died writhing whilst iranon
   pale and slender sang to himself in a far corner and when iranon had
   wept over the grave of romnod and strewn it with green branches such
   as romnod used to love he put aside his silks and gauds and went
   forgotten out of oonai the city of lutes and dancing clad only in the
   ragged purple in which he had come and garlanded with fresh vines from
   the mountains

   into the sunset wandered iranon seeking still for his native land and
   for men who would understand his songs and dreams in all the cities of
   cydathria and in the lands beyond the bnazie desert gayfaced children
   laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple; but iranon
   stayed ever young and wore wreathes upon his golden head whilst he
   sang of aira delight of the past and hope of the future

   so came he one night to the squallid cot of an antique shepherd bent
   and dirty who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh to
   this man iranon spoke as to so many others:

   canst thou tell me where i may find aira the city of marble and
   beryl where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny
   kra sing to the verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees?
   and the shepherd hearing looked long and strangely at iranon as if
   recalling something very far away in time and noted each line of the
   strangers face and his golden hair and his crown of vineleaves but
   he was old and shook his head as he replied:

   o stranger i have indeed heard the name of aira and the other names
   thou hast spoken but they come to me from afar down the waste of long
   years i heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate a beggars
   boy given to strange dreams who would weave long tales about the moon
   and the flowers and the west wind we used to laugh at him for we knew
   him from his birth though he thought himself a kings son he was
   comely even as thou but full of folly and strangeness; and he ran
   away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and
   dreams how often hath he sung to me of lands that never were and
   things that never can be! of aira did he speak much; of aira and the
   river nithra and the falls of the tiny kra there would he ever say he
   once dwelt as a prince though here we knew him from his birth nor was
   there ever a marble city of aira or those who could delight in strange
   songs save in the dreams of mine old playmate iranon who is gone

   and in the twilight as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast
   on the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the
   floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening there walked into the lethal
   quicksands a very old man in tattered purple crowned with whithered
   vineleaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city
   where dreams are understood that night something of youth and beauty
   died in the elder world

   on 16 july 1923 i moved into exham priory after the last workman had
   finished his labours the restoration had been a stupendous task for
   little had remained of the deserted pile but a shelllike ruin; yet
   because it had been the seat of my ancestors i let no expense deter
   me the place had not been inhabited since the reign of james the
   first when a tragedy of intensely hideous though largely unexplained
   nature had struck down the master five of his children and several
   servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the
   third son my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred
   line

   with this sole heir denounced as a murderer the estate had reverted to
   the crown nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate
   himself or regain his property shaken by some horror greater than that
   of conscience or the law and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude
   the ancient edifice from his sight and memory walter de la poer
   eleventh baron exham fled to virginia and there founded the family
   which by the next century had become known as delapore

   exham priory had remained untenanted though later allotted to the
   estates of the norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly
   composite architecture; an architecture involving gothic towers resting
   on a saxon or romanesque substructure whose foundation in turn was of
   a still earlier order or blend of ordersroman and even druidic or
   native cymric if legends speak truly this foundation was a very
   singular thing being merged on one side with the solid limestone of
   the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley
   three miles west of the village of anchester

   architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of
   forgotten centuries but the country folk hated it they had hated it
   hundreds of years before when my ancestors lived there and they hated
   it now with the moss and mould of abandonment on it i had not been a
   day in anchester before i knew i came of an accursed house and this
   week workmen have blown up exham priory and are busy obliterating the
   traces of its foundations the bare statistics of my ancestry i had
   always known together with the fact that my first american forebear
   had come to the colonies under a strange cloud of details however i
   had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always
   maintained by the delapores unlike our planter neighbours we seldom
   boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and renaissance
   heroes; nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have
   been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the civil war by every
   squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening the glories we
   cherished were those achieved since the migration; the glories of a
   proud and honourable if somewhat reserved and unsocial virginia line

   during the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence
   changed by the burning of carfax our home on the banks of the james
   my grandfather advanced in years had perished in that incendiary
   outrage and with him the envelope that had bound us all to the past i
   can recall that fire today as i saw it then at the age of seven with
   the federal soldiers shouting the women screaming and the negroes
   howling and praying my father was in the army defending richmond and
   after many formalities my mother and i were passed through the lines to
   join him

   when the war ended we all moved north whence my mother had come; and i
   grew to manhood middle age and ultimate wealth as a stolid yankee
   neither my father nor i ever knew what our hereditary envelope had
   contained and as i merged into the greyness of massachusetts business
   life i lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far
   back in my family tree had i suspected their nature how gladly i
   would have left exham priory to its moss bats and cobwebs!

   my father died in 1904 but without any message to leave to me or to
   my only child alfred a motherless boy of ten it was this boy who
   reversed the order of family information for although i could give him
   only jesting conjectures about the past he wrote me of some very
   interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to england in
   1917 as an aviation officer apparently the delapores had a colourful
   and perhaps sinister history for a friend of my sons capt edward
   norrys of the royal flying corps dwelt near the family seat at
   anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists
   could equal for wildness and incredibility norrys himself of course
   did not take them so seriously; but they amused my son and made good
   material for his letters to me it was this legendry which definitely
   turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage and made me resolve
   to purchase and restore the family seat which norrys showed to alfred
   in its picturesque desertion and offered to get for him at a
   surprisingly reasonable figure since his own uncle was the present
   owner

   i bought exham priory in 1918 but was almost immediately distracted
   from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed
   invalid during the two years that he lived i thought of nothing but
   his care having even placed my business under the direction of
   partners

   in 1921 as i found myself bereaved and aimless a retired manufacturer
   no longer young i resolved to divert my remaining years with my new
   possession visiting anchester in december i was entertained by capt
   norrys a plump amiable young man who had thought much of my son and
   secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the
   coming restoration exham priory itself i saw without emotion a jumble
   of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with
   rooks nests perched perilously upon a precipice and denuded of
   floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate
   towers

   as i gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when
   my ancestors left it over three centuries before i began to hire
   workmen for the reconstruction in every case i was forced to go
   outside the immediate locality for the anchester villagers had an
   almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place the sentiment was so
   great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers
   causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to include both
   the priory and its ancient family

   my son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits
   because he was a de la poer and i now found myself subtly ostracized
   for a like reason until i convinced the peasants how little i knew of
   my heritage even then they sullenly disliked me so that i had to
   collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of norrys
   what the people could not forgive perhaps was that i had come to
   restore a symbol so abhorrent to them; for rationally or not they
   viewed exham priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and
   werewolves

   piecing together the tales which norrys collected for me and
   supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied
   the ruins i deduced that exham priory stood on the site of a
   prehistoric temple; a druidical or antedruidical thing which must have
   been contemporary with stonehenge that indescribable rites had been
   celebrated there few doubted and there were unpleasant tales of the
   transference of these rites into the cybele worship which the romans
   had introduced

   inscriptions still visible in the subcellar bore such unmistakable
   letters as div    ops    magna mat    sign of the magna
   mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to roman citizens
   anchester had been the camp of the third augustan legion as many
   remains attest and it was said that the temple of cybele was splendid
   and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the
   bidding of a phrygian priest tales added that the fall of the old
   religion did not end the orgies at the temple but that the priests
   lived on in the new faith without real change likewise was it said
   that the rites did not vanish with the roman power and that certain
   among the saxons added to what remained of the temple and gave it the
   essential outline it subsequently preserved making it the centre of a
   cult feared through half the heptarchy about 1000 ad the place is
   mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a
   strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens
   which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace it was never
   destroyed by the danes though after the norman conquest it must have
   declined tremendously since there was no impediment when henry the
   third granted the site to my ancestor gilbert de la poer first baron
   exham in 1261

   of my family before this date there is no evil report but something
   strange must have happened then in one chronicle there is a reference
   to a de la poer as cursed of god in 1307 whilst village legendry had
   nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on
   the foundations of the old temple and priory the fireside tales were
   of the most grisly description all the ghastlier because of their
   frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness they represented my
   ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom gilles de retz
   and the marquis de sade would seem the veriest tyros and hinted
   whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearances
   of villagers through several generations

   the worst characters apparently were the barons and their direct
   heirs; at least most was whispered about these if of healthier
   inclinations it was said an heir would early and mysteriously die to
   make way for another more typical scion there seemed to be an inner
   cult in the family presided over by the head of the house and
   sometimes closed except to a few members temperament rather than
   ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult for it was entered by
   several who married into the family lady margaret trevor from
   cornwall wife of godfrey the second son of the fifth baron became a
   favourite bane of children all over the countryside and the daemon
   heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the
   welsh border preserved in balladry too though not illustrating the
   same point is the hideous tale of lady mary de la poer who shortly
   after her marriage to the earl of shrewsfield was killed by him and his
   mother both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to
   whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world

   these myths and ballads typical as they were of crude superstition
   repelled me greatly their persistence and their application to so
   long a line of my ancestors were especially annoying; whilst the
   imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the
   one known scandal of my immediate forebearsthe case of my cousin
   young randolph delapore of carfax who went among the negroes and became
   a voodoo priest after he returned from the mexican war

   i was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in
   the barren windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the
   graveyard stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering
   squealing white thing on which sir john claves horse had trod one
   night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he
   saw in the priory in the full light of day these things were hackneyed
   spectral lore and i was at that time a pronounced sceptic the
   accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed though not
   especially significant in view of mediaeval custom prying curiosity
   meant death and more than one severed head had been publicly shown on
   the bastionsnow effacedaround exham priory

   a few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque and made me wish i had
   learnt more of the comparative mythology in my youth there was for
   instance the belief that a legion of batwinged devils kept witches
   sabbath each night at the priorya legion whose sustenance might
   explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested
   in the vast gardens and most vivid of all there was the dramatic
   epic of the ratsthe scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst
   forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to
   desertionthe lean filthy ravenous army which had swept all before
   it and devoured fowl cats dogs hogs sheep and even two hapless
   human beings before its fury was spent around that unforgettable
   rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves for it scattered
   among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train

   such was the lore that assailed me as i pushed to completion with an
   elderly obstinacy the work of restoring my ancestral home it must not
   be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal
   psychological environment on the other hand i was constantly praised
   and encouraged by capt norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and
   aided me when the task was done over two years after its
   commencement i viewed the great rooms wainscoted walls vaulted
   ceilings mullioned windows and broad staircases with a pride which
   fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration

   every attribute of the middle ages was cunningly reproduced and the new
   parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations the
   seat of my fathers was complete and i looked forward to redeeming at
   last the local fame of the line which ended in me i could reside here
   permanently and prove that a de la poer (for i had adopted again the
   original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend my comfort was
   perhaps augmented by the fact that although exham priory was
   mediaevally fitted its interior was in truth wholly new and free from
   old vermin and old ghosts alike

   as i have said i moved in on 16 july 1923 my household consisted of
   seven servants and nine cats of which latter species i am particularly
   fond my eldest cat niggerman was seven years old and had come
   with me from my home in bolton massachusetts; the others i had
   accumulated whilst living with capt norrys family during the
   restoration of the priory

   for five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity my time
   being spent mostly in the codification of old family data i had now
   obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and
   flight of walter de la poer which i conceived to be the probable
   contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at carfax it
   appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed
   all the other members of his household except four servant
   confederates in their sleep about two weeks after a shocking
   discovery which changed his whole demeanour but which except by
   implication he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who
   assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach

   this deliberate slaughter which included a father three brothers and
   two sisters was largely condoned by the villagers and so slackly
   treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured unharmed and
   undisguised to virginia; the general whispered sentiment being that he
   had purged the land of an immemorial curse what discovery had prompted
   an act so terrible i could scarcely even conjecture walter de la poer
   must have known for years the sinister tales about his family so that
   this material could have given him no fresh impulse had he then
   witnessed some appalling ancient rite or stumbled upon some frightful
   and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity? he was reputed to
   have been a shy gentle youth in england in virginia he seemed not so
   much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive he was spoken of in
   the diary of another gentleman adventurer francis harley of bellview
   as a man of unexampled justice honour and delicacy

   on 22 july occurred the first incident which though lightly dismissed
   at the time takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later
   events it was so simple as to be almost negligible and could not
   possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be
   recalled that since i was in a building practically fresh and new
   except for the walls and surrounded by a wellbalanced staff of
   servitors apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality

   what i afterward remembered is merely thisthat my old black cat
   whose moods i know so well was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an
   extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character he roved from
   room to room restless and disturbed and sniffed constantly about the
   walls which formed part of the gothic structure i realize how trite
   this soundslike the inevitable dog in the ghost story which always
   growls before his master sees the sheeted figureyet i cannot
   consistently suppress it

   the following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the
   cats in the house he came to me in my study a lofty west room on the
   second storey with groined arches black oak panelling and a triple
   gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and
   even as he spoke i saw the jetty form of niggerman creeping along the
   west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient
   stone

   i told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from
   the old stonework imperceptible to human senses but affecting the
   delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork this i truly
   believed and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats i
   mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years
   and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be
   found in these high walls where they had never been known to stray
   that afternoon i called on capt norrys and he assured me that it
   would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a
   sudden and unprecedented fashion

   that night dispensing as usual with a valet i retired in the west
   tower chamber which i had chosen as my own reached from the study by a
   stone staircase and short gallerythe former partly ancient the
   latter entirely restored this room was circular very high and
   without wainscoting being hung with arras which i had myself chosen in
   london

   seeing that niggerman was with me i shut the heavy gothic door and
   retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly
   counterfeited candles finally switching off the light and sinking on
   the carved and canopied fourposter with the venerable cat in his
   accustomed place across my feet i did not draw the curtains but gazed
   out at the narrow window which i faced there was a suspicion of aurora
   in the sky and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly
   silhouetted

   at some time i must have fallen quietly asleep for i recall a distinct
   sense of leaving strange dreams when the cat started violently from
   his placid position i saw him in the faint auroral glow head strained
   forward fore feet on my ankles and hind feet stretched behind he was
   looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window a
   point which to my eye had nothing to mark it but toward which all my
   attention was now directed

   and as i watched i knew that niggerman was not vainly excited
   whether the arras actually moved i cannot say i think it did very
   slightly but what i can swear to is that behind it i heard a low
   distinct scurrying as of rats or mice in a moment the cat had jumped
   bodily on the screening tapestry bringing the affected section to the
   floor with his weight and exposing a damp ancient wall of stone;
   patched here and there by the restorers and devoid of any trace of
   rodent prowlers

   niggerman raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall
   clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw
   between the wall and the oaken floor he found nothing and after a
   time returned wearily to his place across my feet i had not moved but
   i did not sleep again that night

   in the morning i questioned all the servants and found that none of
   them had noticed anything unusual save that the cook remembered the
   actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill this cat had
   howled at some unknown hour of the night awaking the cook in time for
   her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs
   i drowsed away the noontime and in the afternoon called again on capt
   norrys who became exceedingly interested in what i told him the odd
   incidentsso slight yet so curiousappealed to his sense of the
   picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscenses of local
   ghostly lore we were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats and
   norrys lent me some traps and paris green which i had the servants
   place in strategic localities when i returned

   i retired early being very sleepy but was harassed by dreams of the
   most horrible sort i seemed to be looking down from an immense height
   upon a twilit grotto kneedeep with filth where a whitebearded
   daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous flabby
   beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing then as
   the swineherd paused and nodded over his task a mighty swarm of rats
   rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man
   alike

   from this terrific vision i was abruptly awakened by the motions of
   niggerman who had been sleeping as usual across my feet this time i
   did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses and of
   the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle unconscious of
   their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive
   with nauseous soundthe verminous slithering of ravenous gigantic
   rats there was now no aurora to show the state of the arrasthe
   fallen section of which had been replacedbut i was not too frightened
   to switch on the light

   as the bulbs leapt into radiance i saw a hideous shaking all over the
   tapestry causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular
   dance of death this motion disappeared almost at once and the sound
   with it springing out of bed i poked at the arras with the long
   handle of a warmingpan that rested near and lifted one section to see
   what lay beneath there was nothing but the patched stone wall and
   even the cat had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences when
   i examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room i found
   all of the openings sprung though no trace remained of what had been
   caught and had escaped

   further sleep was out of the question so lighting a candle i opened
   the door and went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study
   niggerman following at my heels before we had reached the stone
   steps however the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the
   ancient flight as i descended the stairs myself i became suddenly
   aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature which could
   not be mistaken

   the oakpanelled walls were alive with rats scampering and milling
   whilst niggerman was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter
   reaching the bottom i switched on the light which did not this time
   cause the noise to subside the rats continued their riot stampeding
   with such force and distinctness that i could finally assign to their
   motions a definite direction these creatures in numbers apparently
   inexhaustible were engaged in one stupendous migration from
   inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or inconceivably below

   i now heard steps in the corridor and in another moment two servants
   pushed open the massive door they were searching the house for some
   unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a
   snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several
   flights of stairs and squat yowling before the closed door to the
   subcellar i asked them if they had heard the rats but they replied
   in the negative and when i turned to call their attention to the
   sounds in the panels i realized that the noise had ceased

   with the two men i went down to the door of the subcellar but found
   the cats already dispersed later i resolved to explore the crypt
   below but for the present i merely made a round of the traps all were
   sprung yet all were tenantless satisfying myself that no one had
   heard the rats save the felines and me i sat in my study till morning
   thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend i had unearthed
   concerning the building i inhabited i slept some in the forenoon
   leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval
   plan of furnishing could not banish later i telephoned to capt
   norrys who came over and helped me explore the subcellar

   absolutely nothing untoward was found although we could not repress a
   thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by roman hands every
   low arch and massive pillar was romannot the debased romanesque of
   the bungling saxons but the severe and harmonious classicism of the
   age of the caesars; indeed the walls abounded with inscriptions
   familiar to the antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the
   placethings like p getae prop    temp    dona    and l
   praeg    vs    pontifi    atys   

   the reference to atys made me shiver for i had read catullus and knew
   something of the hideous rites of the eastern god whose worship was so
   mixed with that of cybele norrys and i by the light of lanterns
   tried to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain
   irregularly rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars
   but could make nothing of them we remembered that one pattern a sort
   of rayed sun was held by students to imply a nonroman origin
   suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the roman
   priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site
   on one of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder the
   largest in the centre of the room had certain features on the upper
   surface which indicated its connection with fireprobably burnt
   offerings

   such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats howled
   and where norrys and i now determined to pass the night couches were
   brought down by the servants who were told not to mind any nocturnal
   actions of the cats and niggerman was admitted as much for help as
   for companionship we decided to keep the great oak doora modern
   replica with slits for ventilationtightly closed; and with this
   attended to we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever
   might occur

   the vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory and
   undoubtedly far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff
   overlooking the waste valley that it had been the goal of the
   scuffling and unexplainable rats i could not doubt though why i could
   not tell as we lay there expectantly i found my vigil occasionally
   mixed with halfformed dreams from which the uneasy motions of the cat
   across my feet would rouse me

   these dreams were not wholesome but horribly like the one i had had
   the night before i saw again the twilit grotto and the swineherd with
   his unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth and as i looked at
   these things they seemed nearer and more distinctso distinct that i
   could almost observe their features then i did observe the flabby
   features of one of themand awakened with such a scream that
   niggerman started up whilst capt norrys who had not slept laughed
   considerably norrys might have laughed moreor perhaps lesshad he
   known what it was that made me scream but i did not remember myself
   till later ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful way

   norrys waked me when the phenomena began out of the same frightful
   dream i was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to
   the cats indeed there was much to listen to for beyond the closed
   door at the head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline
   yelling and clawing whilst niggerman unmindful of his kindred
   outside was running excitedly round the bare stone walls in which i
   heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the night
   before

   an acute terror now rose within me for here were anomalies which
   nothing normal could well explain these rats if not the creatures of
   a madness which i shared with the cats alone must be burrowing and
   sliding in roman walls i had thought to be solid limestone blocks   
   unless perhaps the action of water through more than seventeen
   centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear
   and ample    but even so the spectral horror was no less; for if
   these were living vermin why did not norrys hear their disgusting
   commotion? why did he urge me to watch niggerman and listen to the
   cats outside and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could
   have aroused them?

   by the time i had managed to tell him as rationally as i could what i
   thought i was hearing my ears gave me the last fading impression of
   scurrying; which had retreated still downward far underneath this
   deepest of subcellars till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were
   riddled with questing rats norrys was not as sceptical as i had
   anticipated but instead seemed profoundly moved he motioned to me to
   notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour as if giving
   up the rats for lost; whilst niggerman had a burst of renewed
   restlessness and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the
   large stone altar in the centre of the room which was nearer norrys
   couch than mine

   my fear of the unknown was at this point very great something
   astounding had occurred and i saw that capt norrys a younger
   stouter and presumably more naturally materialistic man was affected
   fully as much as myselfperhaps because of his lifelong and intimate
   familiarity with local legend we could for the moment do nothing but
   watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base
   of the altar occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that
   persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some
   favour for him

   norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place
   where niggerman was pawing; silently kneeling and scraping away the
   lichens of the centuries which joined the massive preroman block to
   the tessellated floor he did not find anything and was about to
   abandon his efforts when i noticed a trivial circumstance which made me
   shudder even though it implied nothing more than i had already
   imagined

   i told him of it and we both looked at its almost imperceptible
   manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and
   acknowledgment it was only thisthat the flame of the lantern set
   down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a
   draught of air which it had not before received and which came
   indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where norrys was
   scraping away the lichens

   we spent the rest of the night in the brilliantlylighted study
   nervously discussing what we should do next the discovery that some
   vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the romans underlay this
   accursed pile some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of
   three centuries would have been sufficient to excite us without any
   background of the sinister as it was the fascination became twofold;
   and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the
   priory forever in superstitious caution or to gratify our sense of
   adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown
   depths

   by morning we had compromised and decided to go to london to gather a
   group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the
   mystery it should be mentioned that before leaving the subcellar we
   had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognized as
   the gate to a new pit of nameless fear what secret would open the
   gate wiser men than we would have to find

   during many days in london capt norrys and i presented our facts
   conjectures and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities all
   men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future
   explorations might develop we found most of them little disposed to
   scoff but instead intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic it
   is hardly necessary to name them all but i may say that they included
   sir william brinton whose excavations in the troad excited most of the
   world in their day as we all took the train for anchester i felt
   myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations a sensation
   symbolized by the air of mourning among the many americans at the
   unexpected death of the president on the other side of the world

   on the evening of 7 august we reached exham priory where the servants
   assured me that nothing unusual had occurred the cats even old
   niggerman had been perfectly placid and not a trap in the house had
   been sprung we were to begin exploring on the following day awaiting
   which i assigned wellappointed rooms to all my guests

   i myself retired in my own tower chamber with niggerman across my
   feet sleep came quickly but hideous dreams assailed me there was a
   vision of a roman feast like that of trimalchio with a horror in a
   covered platter then came that damnable recurrent thing about the
   swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto yet when i awoke
   it was full daylight with normal sounds in the house below the rats
   living or spectral had not troubled me; and niggerman was still
   quietly asleep on going down i found that the same tranquillity had
   prevailed elsewhere; a condition which one of the assembled servantsa
   fellow named thornton devoted to the psychicrather absurdly laid to
   the fact that i had now been shown the thing which certain forces had
   wished to show me

   all was now ready and at 11 am our entire group of seven men
   bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation
   went down to the subcellar and bolted the door behind us niggerman
   was with us for the investigators found no occasion to depise his
   excitability and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of
   obscure rodent manifestations we noted the roman inscriptions and
   unknown altar designs only briefly for three of the savants had
   already seen them and all knew their characteristics prime attention
   was paid to the momentous central altar and within an hour sir william
   brinton had caused it to tilt backward balanced by some unknown
   species of counterweight

   there now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had
   we not been prepared through a nearly square opening in the tiled
   floor sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that
   it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre was a ghastly
   array of human or semihuman bones those which retained their
   collocation as skeletons showed attitudes of panic fear and over all
   were the marks of rodent gnawing the skulls denoted nothing short of
   utter idiocy cretinism or primitive semiapedom

   above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage
   seemingly chiselled from the solid rock and conducting a current of
   air this current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed
   vault but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it we did not
   pause long but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps it
   was then that sir william examining the hewn walls made the odd
   observation that the passage according to the direction of the
   strokes must have been chiselled from beneath

   i must be very deliberate now and choose my words after ploughing
   down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light
   ahead; not any mystic phosphorescence but a filtered daylight which
   could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that
   overlooked the waste valley that such fissures had escaped notice
   from outside was hardly remarkable for not only is the valley wholly
   uninhabited but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an
   aeronaut could study its face in detail a few steps more and our
   breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally
   that thornton the psychic investigator actually fainted in the arms
   of the dazed men who stood behind him norrys his plump face utterly
   white and flabby simply cried out inarticulately; whilst i think that
   what i did was to gasp or hiss and cover my eyes

   the man behind methe only one of the party older than icroaked the
   hackneyed my god! in the most cracked voice i ever heard of seven
   cultivated men only sir william brinton retained his composure a
   thing the more to his credit because he led the party and must have
   seen the sight first

   it was a twilit grotto of enormous height stretching away farther than
   any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and
   horrible suggestion there were buildings and other architectural
   remainsin one terrified glance i saw a weird pattern of tumuli a
   savage circle of monoliths a lowdomed roman ruin a sprawling saxon
   pile and an early english edifice of woodbut all these were dwarfed
   by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the
   ground for yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human
   bones or bones at least as human as those on the steps like a foamy
   sea they stretched some fallen apart but others wholly or partly
   articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of
   daemoniac frenzy either fighting off some menace or clutching other
   forms with cannibal intent

   when dr trask the anthropologist stopped to classify the skulls he
   found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him they were mostly
   lower than the piltdown man in the scale of evolution but in every
   case definitely human many were of higher grade and a very few were
   the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types all the bones
   were gnawed mostly by rats but somewhat by others of the halfhuman
   drove mixed with them were many tiny bones of ratsfallen members of
   the lethal army which closed the ancient epic

   i wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that
   hideous day of discovery not hoffman nor huysmans could conceive a
   scene more wildly incredible more frenetically repellent or more
   gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven
   staggered; each stumbling on revelation after revelation and trying to
   keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken
   place there three hundred or a thousand or two thousand or ten
   thousand years ago it was the antechamber of hell and poor thornton
   fainted again when trask told him that some of the skeleton things must
   have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more
   generations

   horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural
   remains the quadruped thingswith their occasional recruits from the
   biped classhad been kept in stone pens out of which they must have
   broken in their last delirium of hunger or ratfear there had been
   great herds of them evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose
   remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of
   the huge stone bins older than rome i knew now why my ancestors had
   had such excessive gardenswould to heaven i could forget! the purpose
   of the herds i did not have to ask

   sir william standing with his searchlight in the roman ruin
   translated aloud the most shocking ritual i have ever known; and told
   of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of cybele found
   and mingled with their own norrys used as he was to the trenches
   could not walk straight when he came out of the english building it
   was a butcher shop and kitchenhe had expected thatbut it was too
   much to see familiar english implements in such a place and to read
   familiar english graffiti there some as recent as 1610 i could not go
   in that buildingthat building whose daemon activities were stopped
   only by the dagger of my ancestor walter de la poer

   what i did venture to enter was the low saxon building whose oaken door
   had fallen and there i found a terrible row of ten stone cells with
   rusty bars three had tenants all skeletons of high grade and on the
   bony forefinger of one i found a seal ring with my own coatofarms
   sir william found a vault with far older cells below the roman chapel
   but these cells were empty below them was a low crypt with cases of
   formally arranged bones some of them bearing terrible parallel
   inscriptions carved in latin greek and the tongue of phyrgia

   meanwhile dr trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli and
   brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a
   gorillas and which bore indescribably ideographic carvings through
   all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed once i saw him monstrously
   perched atop a mountain of bones and wondered at the secrets that
   might lie behind his yellow eyes

   having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this
   twilit areaan area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent
   dreamwe turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern
   where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate we shall never
   know what sightless stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we
   went for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind
   but there was plenty to engross us close at hand for we had not gone
   far before the searchlights showed that accursed infinity of pits in
   which the rats had feasted and whose sudden lack of replenishment had
   driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of
   starving things and then to burst forth from the priory in that
   historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget

   god! those carrion black pits of sawed picked bones and opened skulls!
   those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid celtic roman
   and english bones of countless unhallowed centuries! some of them were
   full and none can say how deep they had once been others were still
   bottomless to our searchlights and peopled by unnamable fancies what
   i thought of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the
   blackness of their quests in this grisly tartarus?

   once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink and i had a moment
   of ecstatic fear i must have been musing a long time for i could not
   see any of the party but plump capt norrys then there came a sound
   from that inky boundless farther distance that i thought i knew; and
   i saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged egyptian god
   straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown but i was not far
   behind for there was no doubt after another second it was the
   eldritch scurrying of those fiendborn rats always questing for new
   horrors and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns
   of earths centre where nyarlathotep the mad faceless god howls
   blindly in the darkness to the piping of two amorphous idiot
   fluteplayers

   my searchlight expired but still i ran i heard voices and yowls and
   echoes but above all there gently rose that impious insidious
   scurrying; gently rising rising as a stiff bloated corpse gently
   rises above an oily river that flows under the endless onyx bridges to
   a black putrid sea

   something bumped into mesomething soft and plump it must have been
   the rats; the viscous gelatinous ravenous army that feast on the dead
   and the living    why shouldnt rats eat a de la poer as a de la
   poer eats forbidden things?    the war ate my boy damn them
   all    and the yanks ate carfax with flames and burnt grandsire
   delapore and the secret    no no i tell you i am not that daemon
   swineherd in the twilit grotto! it was not edward norrys fat face on
   that flabby fungous thing! who says i am a de la poer? he lived but my
   boy died!    shall a norrys hold the land of a de la poer?   
   its voodoo i tell you    that spotted snake    curse you
   thornton ill teach you to faint at what my family do!    sblood
   thou stinkard ill learn ye how to gust    wolde ye swynke me

   this is what they say i said when they found me in the blackness after
   three hours; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump
   halfeaten body of capt norrys with my own cat leaping and tearing at
   my throat now they have blown up exham priory taken my niggerman
   away from me and shut me into this barred room at hanwell with fearful
   whispers about my heredity and experience thornton is in the next
   room but they prevent me from talking to him they are trying too to
   suppress most of the facts concerning the priory when i speak of poor
   norrys they accuse me of this hideous thing but they must know that i
   did not do it they must know it was the rats; the slithering scurrying
   rats whose scampering will never let me sleep; the daemon rats that
   race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater
   horrors than i have ever known; the rats they can never hear; the rats
   the rats in the walls

   the rose of england
   by h p lovecraft
   12314the rose of englandh p lovecraft

   at morn the rosebud greets the sun
   and sheds the evening dew
   expanding ere the day is done
      in bloom of radiant hue
   and when the sun his rest hath found
   rosepetals strew the garden round!

   thus that blest isle that owns the rose
   from mist and darkness came
   a million glories to disclose
      and spread britannias name;
   and ere lifes sun shall leave the blue
   england shall reign the whole world through!

   the rutted road by hp lovecraft

   bleak autumn mists send down their chilly load a raven shivers as he
   flutters by; thro lonely pasture winds the rutted road where bordring
   elms loom bare against the sky

   those deepsunk tracks which dumbly point ahead oer travelld sands
   that stretch to visions rim wake hidden thoughtsa longing half a
   dread till fancy pauses at the prospect dim

   descending shadows bid me haste along the ancient ruts so many knew
   before; a cricket mocks me with his mirthless song i fear the pathi
   fain would see no more

   yet here with oxdrawn cart each thoughtless swain his course
   pursud nor left the common way; can i superior to the rustic train
   on brighter byroads find the dawning day?

   with questing look i scan the darkning moor; perchance oer yonder
   mound all blessings wait but still the rutted roads resistless lure
   constrains my progress to the path of fate

   so must i grope between the brooding trees where those before me found
   the mystic night; i travel onward past the witherd leas but what
   beyond the bend awaits my sight?

   do fairer lands than this invite my feet? will fate on me her choicest
   boon bestow? what lies head my weary soul to greet? why is it that i
   do not wish to know?

   1406212the secret cave or john lees adventureh p lovecraft18981899

   now be good children said mrs lee while i am away & dont get into
   mischief mr & mrs lee were going off for the day & to leave the two
   children john 10 yrs old & alice 2 yrs old yes replied john

   as soon as the elder lees were away the younger lees went down cellar &
   began to rummage among the rubbish little alice leaned against the wall
   watching john as john was making a boat of barrel staves the little
   girl gave a piercing cry as the bricks behind her crumbled away he
   rushed up to her & lifted her out screaming loudly as soon as her
   screams subsided she said the wall went away john went up & saw that
   there was a passage he said to the little girl lets come & see what
   this is yes she said the entered the place they could stand up it
   the passage was farther than they could see they john went back
   upstairs & went to the kitchen drawer & got 2 candles & some matches &
   then they went back to the cellar passage the two once more entered
   there was plastering on the walls ceiling & floor nothing was visible
   but a box this was for a seat nevertheless they examined it & found it
   to contain nothing the walked on farther & pretty soon the plastering
   left off & they were in a cave little alice was frightened at first but
   at her brothers assurance that it was all right she allayed her
   fears soon they came to a small box which john took up & carried
   within pretty soon they came on a boat in it were two oars he dragged
   it with difficulty along with him soon they found the passage came to
   an abrupt stop he pulled the obstacle away & to his dismay water rushed
   in in torrents john was an expert swimmer & long breathede he had just
   taken a breath so he tried to rise but with the box & his sister he
   found it quite impossible then he caught sight of the boat rising he
   grasped it   

   the next he knew he was on the surface clinging tightly to the body of
   his sister & the mysterious box he could not imagine how the water got
   in but a new peril menaced them if the water continued rising it would
   rise to the top suddenly a thought presented itself he could shut off
   the water he speedily did this & lifting the now lifeless body of his
   sister into the boat he himself climed in & sailed down the passage it
   was gruesome & uncanny absolutely dark his candle being put out by the
   flood & a dead body lying near he did not gaze about him but rowed for
   his life when he did look up he was floating in his own cellar he
   quickly rushed up stairs with the body to find his parents had come
   home he told them the story

        

   the funeral of alice occupied so much time that john quite forgot about
   the boxbut when they did open it they found it to be a solid gold
   chunk worth about $10000 enough to pay for any thing but the death of
   his sister

   the shunned house

                             by h p lovecraft

      a posthumous story of immense power written by a master of weird
   fictiona tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old house in
                                 new england

   from even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent sometimes it
   enters directly into the composition of the events while sometimes it
   relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places the
   latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of
   providence where in the late forties edgar allan poe used to sojourn
   often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess mrs
   whitman poe generally stopped at the mansion house in benefit
   streetthe renamed golden ball inn whose roof has sheltered
   washington jefferson and lafayetteand his favorite walk led
   northward along the same street to mrs whitmans home and the
   neighboring hillside churchyard of st johns whose hidden expanse of
   eighteenth century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination
   o howard phillips lovecraft died last march at the height of his
   career though only fortysix years of age he had built up an
   international reputation by the artistry and impeccable literary
   craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides of
   the atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of weird
   fiction his ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding dread and
   unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the posthumous tale
   presented here: the shunned house

   now the irony is this in this walk so many times repeated the
   worlds greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to
   pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy
   antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill with a
   great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open
   country it does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it nor is
   there any evidence that he even noticed it and yet that house to the
   two persons in possession of certain information equals or outranks in
   horror the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it
   unknowingly and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is
   unutterably hideous

   the house wasand for that matter still isof a kind to attract the
   attention of the curious originally a farm or semifarm building it
   followed the average new england colonial lines of the middle
   eighteenth centurythe prosperous peakedroof sort with two stories
   and dormerless attic and with the georgian doorway and interior
   panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time it faced
   south with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward
   rising hill and the other exposed to the foundations toward the
   street its construction over a century and a half ago had followed
   the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity;
   for benefit streetat first called back streetwas laid out as a lane
   winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers and straightened
   only when the removal of the bodies to the north burial ground made it
   decently possible to cut through the old family plots

   at the start the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a
   precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at
   about the time of the revolution sheared off most of the intervening
   space exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be
   made giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window
   above ground close to the new line of public travel when the sidewalk
   was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was
   removed; and poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of
   dull gray brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of
   ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper

   picture of a man leaving a house inset in a picture of a naked
   bearded man cowering among plants

   that awful door in benefit street which i had left ajar

   the farmlike ground extended back very deeply up the hill almost to
   wheaton street the space south of the house abutting on benefit
   street was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level
   forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp mossy stone
   pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between
   canyonlike surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn rheumy brick
   walks and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns rusted
   kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks and similar paraphernalia
   set off the weatherbeaten front door with its broken fanlight rotting
   ionic pilasters and wormy triangular pediment

   what i heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people
   died there in alarmingly great numbers that i was told was why the
   original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the
   place it was plainly unhealthy perhaps because of the dampness and
   fungous growths in the cellar the general sickish smell the drafts of
   the hallways or the quality of the well and pump water these things
   were bad enough and these were all that gained belief among the
   persons whom i knew only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle doctor
   elihu whipple revealed to me at length the darker vaguer surmises
   which formed an undercurrent of folklore among oldtime servants and
   humble folk; surmises which never travelled far and which were largely
   forgotten when providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting
   modern population

   the general fact is that the house was never regarded by the solid
   part of the community as in any real sense haunted there were no
   widespread tales of rattling chains cold currents of air extinguished
   lights or faces at the window extremists sometimes said the house was
   unlucky but that is as far as even they went what was really beyond
   dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more
   accurately had died there since after some peculiar happenings over
   sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer
   impossibility of renting it these persons were not all cut off
   suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was
   insidiously sapped so that each one died the sooner from whatever
   tendency to weakness he may have naturally had and those who did not
   die displayed in varying degree a type of anemia or consumption and
   sometimes a decline of the mental faculties which spoke ill for the
   salubriousness of the building neighboring houses it must be added
   seemed entirely free from the noxious quality

   this much i knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show
   me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous
   investigation in my childhood the shunned house was vacant with
   barren gnarled and terrible old trees long queerly pale grass and
   nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds
   never lingered we boys used to overrun the place and i can still
   recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this
   sinister vegetation but at the eldritch atmosphere and odor of the
   dilapidated house whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest
   of shudders the smallpaned windows were largely broken and a
   nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling shaky
   interior shutters peeling wallpaper falling plaster rickety
   staircases and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained
   the dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful; and brave indeed
   was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic a
   vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the
   gable ends and filled with a massed wreckage of chests chairs and
   spinningwheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and
   festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes

   but after all the attic was not the most terrible part of the house
   it was the dank humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest
   repulsion on us even though it was wholly above ground on the street
   side with only a thin door and windowpierced brick wall to separate
   it from the busy sidewalk we scarcely knew whether to haunt it in
   spectral fascination or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our
   sanity for one thing the bad odor of the house was strongest there;
   and for another thing we did not like the white fungous growths which
   occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth
   floor those fungi grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard
   outside were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of
   toadstools and indianpipes whose like we had never seen in any other
   situation they rotted quickly and at one stage became slightly
   phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passersby sometimes spoke of
   witchfires glowing behind the broken panes of the fetorspreading
   windows

   we nevereven in our wildest halloween moodsvisited this cellar by
   night but in some of our daytime visits could detect the
   phosphorescence especially when the day was dark and wet there was
   also a subtler thing we often thought we detecteda very strange thing
   which was however merely suggestive at most i refer to a sort of
   cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floora vague shifting deposit of
   mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the
   sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen
   once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny
   resemblance to a doubledup human figure though generally no such
   kinship existed and often there was no whitish deposit whatever

   on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally
   strong and when in addition i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin
   yellowish shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward
   the yawning fireplace i spoke to my uncle about the matter he smiled
   at this odd conceit but it seemed that his smile was tinged with
   reminiscence later i heard that a similar notion entered into some of
   the wild ancient tales of the common folka notion likewise alluding
   to ghoulish wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney and
   queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous treeroots that thrust
   their way into the cellar through the loose foundationstones

   not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data
   which he had collected concerning the shunned house doctor whipple was
   a sane conservative physician of the old school and for ail his
   interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward
   the abnormal his own view postulating simply a building and location
   of markedly unsanitary qualities had nothing to do with abnormality;
   but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own
   interest would in a boys fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome
   imaginative associations

   the doctor was a bachelor; a whitehaired cleanshaven oldfashioned
   gentleman and a local historian of note who had often broken a lance
   with such controversial guardians of tradition as sidney s rider and
   thomas w bicknell he lived with one manservant in a georgian
   homestead with knocker and ironrailed steps balanced eerily on the
   steep ascent of north court street beside the ancient brick court and
   colony house where his grandfathera cousin of that celebrated
   privateersman captain whipple who burnt his majestys armed schooner
   gaspee in 1772had voted in the legislature on may 4 1776 for the
   independence of the rhode island colony around him in the damp
   lowceiled library with the musty white panelling heavy carved
   overmantel and smallpaned vineshaded windows were the relics and
   records of his ancient family among which were many dubious allusions
   to the shunned house in benefit street that pest spot lies not far
   distantfor benefit runs iedgewise just above the court house along
   the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed

   when in the end my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from
   my uncle the hoarded lore i sought there lay before me a strange
   enough chronicle longwinded statistical and drearily genealogical
   as some of the matter was there ran through it a continuous thread of
   brooding tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which
   impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor separate
   events fitted together uncannily and seemingly irrelevant details held
   mines of hideous possibilities a new and burning curiosity grew in me
   compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate

   the first revelation led to an exhaustive research and finally to that
   shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine for at
   the last my uncle insisted on joining the search i had commenced and
   after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me i am
   lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with
   honor virtue good taste benevolence and learning i have reared a
   marble urn to his memory in st johns churchyardthe place that poe
   lovedthe hidden grove of giant willows on the hill where tombs and
   headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the
   houses and bank walls of benefit street

   the history of the house opening amidst a maze of dates revealed no
   trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the
   prosperous and honorable family who built it yet from the first a
   taint of calamity soon increased to boding significance was apparent
   my uncles carefully compiled record began with the building of the
   structure in 1763 and followed the theme with an unusual amount of
   detail the shunned house it seems was first inhabited by william
   harris and his wife rhoby dexter with their children elkanah born in
   1755 abigail born in 1757 william jr born in 1759 and ruth born
   in 1761 harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the west india
   trade connected with the firm of obadiah brown and his nephews after
   browns death in 1761 the new firm of nicholas brown & company made
   him master of the brig prudence providencebuilt of 120 tons thus
   enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his
   marriage

   the site he had chosena recently straightened part of the new and
   fashionable back street which ran along the side of the hill above
   crowded cheapsidewas all that could be wished and the building did
   justice to the location it was the best that moderate means could
   afford and harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth
   child which the family expected that child a boy came in december;
   but was stillborn nor was any child to be born alive in that house for
   a century and a half

   the next april sickness occurred among the children and abigail and
   ruth died before the month was over doctor job ives diagnosed the
   trouble as some infantile fever though others declared it was more of
   a mere wastingaway or decline it seemed in any event to be
   contagious; for hannah bowen one of the two servants died of it in
   the following june eli lideason the other servant constantly
   complained of weakness; and would have returned to his fathers farm in
   rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for mehitabel pierce who was
   hired to succeed hannah he died the next yeara sad year indeed
   since it marked the death of william harris himself enfeebled as he
   was by the climate of martinique where his occupation had kept him for
   considerable periods during the preceding decade

   the widowed rhoby harris never recovered from the shock of her
   husbands death and the passing of her firstborn elkanah two years
   later was the final blow to her reason in 1768 she fell victim to a
   mild form of insanity and was thereafter confined to the upper part of
   the house; her elder maiden sister mercy dexter having moved in to
   take charge of the family mercy was a plain rawboned woman of great
   strength; but her health visibly declined from the time of her advent
   she was greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister and had an especial
   affection for her only surviving nephew william who from a sturdy
   infant had become a sickly spindling lad in this year the servant
   mehitabel died and the other servant preserved smith left without
   coherent explanationor at least with only some wild tales and a
   complaint that he disliked the smell of the place for a time mercy
   could secure no more help since the seven deaths and case of madness
   all occurring within five years space had begun to set in motion the
   body of fireside rumor which later became so bizarre ultimately
   however she obtained new servants from out of town; ann white a
   morose woman from that part of north kingstown now set off as the
   township of exeter and a capable boston man named zenas low

   it was ann white who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle
   talk mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the
   nooseneck hill country for that remote bit of backwoods was then as
   now a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions as lately as 1892
   an exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its
   heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the
   public health and peace and one may imagine the point of view of the
   same section in 1768 anns tongue was perniciously active and within
   a few months mercy discharged her filling her place with a faithful
   and amiable amazon from newport maria robbins

   meanwhile poor rhoby harris in her madness gave voice to dreams and
   imaginings of the most hideous sort at times her screams became
   insupportable and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors
   which necessitated her sons temporary residence with his cousin peleg
   harris in presbyterian lane near the new college building the boy
   would seem to improve after these visits and had mercy been as wise as
   she was wellmeaning she would have let him live permanently with
   peleg just what mrs harris cried out in her fits of violence
   tradition hesitates to say; or rather presents such extravagant
   accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity
   certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the
   rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic
   form of that language or that the same person alone and guarded
   complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her in
   1772 the servant zenas died and when mrs harris heard of it she
   laughed with a shocking delight utterly foreign to her the next year
   she herself died and was laid to rest in the north burial ground
   beside her husband

   upon the outbreak of trouble with great britain in 1775 william
   harris despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution
   managed to enlist in the army of observation under general greene; and
   from that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige in
   1780 as a captain in the rhode island forces in new jersey under
   colonel angell he met and married phebe hetfield of elizabeth town
   whom he brought to providence upon his honorable discharge in the
   following year

   the young soldiers return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness
   the house it is true was still in good condition; and the street had
   been widened and changed in name from back street to benefit street
   but mercy dexters once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious
   decay so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow
   voice and disconcerting pallorqualities shared to a singular degree
   by the one remaining servant maria in the autumn of 1782 phebe harris
   gave birth to a stillborn daughter and on the fifteenth of the next
   may mercy dexter took leave of a useful austere and virtuous life

   william harris at last thoroughly convinced of the radically
   unhealthful nature of his abode now took steps toward quitting it and
   closing it for ever securing temporary quarters for himself and his
   wife at the newly opened golden ball inn he arranged for the building
   of a new and finer house in westminster street in the growing part of
   the town across the great bridge there in 1785 his son dutee was
   born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce
   drove them back across the river and over the hill to angell street in
   the newer east side residence district where the late archer harris
   built his sumptuous but hideous frenchroofed mansion in 1876 william
   and phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797 but
   dutee was brought up by his cousin rathbone harris pelegs son

   rathbone was a practical man and rented the benefit street house
   despite williams wish to keep it vacant he considered it an
   obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boys property nor
   did he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so
   many changes of tenants or the steadily growing aversion with which
   the house was generally regarded it is likely that he felt only
   vexation when in 1804 the town council ordered him to fumigate the
   place with sulfur tar and gum camphor on account of the
   muchdiscussed deaths of four persons presumably caused by the then
   diminishing fever epidemic they said the place had a febrile smell

   dutee himself thought little of the house for he grew up to be a
   privateersman and served with distinction on the vigilant under
   captain cahoone in the war of 1812 he returned unharmed married in
   1814 and became a father on that memorable night of september 23
   1815 when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town
   and floated a tall sloop well up westminster street so that its masts
   almost tapped the harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new
   boy welcome was a seamans son

   welcome did not survive his father but lived to perish gloriously at
   fredericksburg in 1862 neither he nor his son archer knew of the
   shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to
   rentperhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt
   old age indeed it never was rented after a series of deaths
   culminating in 1861 which the excitement of the war tended to throw
   into obscurity carrington harris last of the male line knew it only
   as a deserted and somewhat picturesque center of legend until i told
   him my experience he had meant to tear it down and build an apartment
   house on the site but after my account decided to let it stand
   install plumbing and rent it nor has he yet had any difficulty in
   obtaining tenants the horror has gone

                                      3

   it may well be imagined how powerfully i was affected by the annals of
   the harrises in this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a
   persistent evil beyond anything in nature as i had known it; an evil
   clearly connected with the house and not with the family this
   impression was confirmed by my uncles less systematic array of
   miscellaneous datalegends transcribed from servant gossip cuttings
   from the papers copies of death certificates by fellowphysicians and
   the like all of this material i cannot hope to give for my uncle was
   a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;
   but i may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their
   recurrence through many reports from diverse sources for example the
   servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous
   and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence
   there had been servantsann white especiallywho would not use the
   cellar kitchen and at least three welldefined legends bore upon the
   queer quasihuman or diabolic outlines assumed by treeroots and
   patches of mold in that region these latter narratives interested me
   profoundly on account of what i had seen in my boyhood but i felt
   that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by
   additions from the common stock of local ghost lore

   ann white with her exeter superstition had promulgated the most
   extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that
   there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampiresthe dead
   who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the
   livingwhose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits
   abroad by night to destroy a vampire one must the grandmothers say
   exhume it and burn its heart or at least drive a stake through that
   organ; and anns dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had
   been prominent in bringing about her discharge

   her tales however commanded a wide audience and were the more
   readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for
   burial purposes to me their interest depended less on this
   circumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they
   dovetailed with certain other thingsthe complaint of the departing
   servant preserved smith who had preceded ann and never heard of her
   that something sucked his breath at night; the deathcertificates of
   the fever victims of 1804 issued by doctor chad hopkins and showing
   the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood; and the
   obscure passages of poor rhoby harriss ravings where she complained
   of the sharp teeth of a glassyeyed halfvisible presence

   free from unwarranted superstitition though i am these things produced
   in me an odd sensation which was intensified by a pair of widely
   separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned
   houseone from the providence gazette and countryjournal of april 12
   1815 and the other from the daily transcript and chronicle of october
   27 1845each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance
   whose duplication was remarkable it seems that in both instances the
   dying person in 1815 a gentle old lady named stafford and in 1845 a
   schoolteacher of middle age named eleazar durfee became transfigured
   in a horrible way glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat
   of the attending physician even more puzzling though was the final
   case which put an end to the renting of the housea series of anemia
   deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would
   craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or
   wrist

   this was in 1860 and 1861 when my uncle had just begun his medical
   practise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his
   elder professional colleagues the really inexplicable thing was the
   way in which the victimsignorant people for the illsmelling and
   widely shunned house could now be rented to no otherswould babble
   maledictions in french a language they could not possibly have studied
   to any extent it made one think of poor rhoby harris nearly a century
   before and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical
   data on the house after listening some time subsequent to his return
   from the war to the firsthand account of doctors chase and whitmarsh
   indeed i could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject
   and that he was glad of my own interestan openminded and sympathetic
   interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others
   would merely have laughed his fancy had not gone so far as mine but
   he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities and
   worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and
   macabre

   for my part i was disposed to take the whole subject with profound
   seriousness and began at once not only to review the evidence but to
   accumulate as much more as i could i talked with the elderly archer
   harris then owner of the house many times before his death in 1916;
   and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister alice an
   authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected
   when however i asked them what connection with france or its language
   the house could have they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and
   ignorant as i archer knew nothing and all that miss harris could say
   was that an old allusion her grandfather dutee harris had heard of
   might have shed a little light the old seaman who had survived his
   son welcomes death in battle by two years had not himself known the
   legend but recalled that his earliest nurse the ancient maria
   robbins seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird
   significance to the french raving of rhoby harris which she had so
   often heard during the last days of that hapless woman maria had been
   at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783
   and had seen mercy dexter die once she hinted to the child dutee of a
   somewhat peculiar circumstance in mercys last moments but lie had
   soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar the
   granddaughter moreover recalled even this much with difficulty she
   and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was
   archers son carrington the present owner with whom i talked after my
   experience

   having exhausted the harris family of all the information it could
   furnish i turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a
   zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown
   in the same work what i wished was a comprehensive history of the site
   from its very settlement in 1636or even before if any narragansett
   indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data i found at the
   start that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot
   granted originally to john throckmorton; one of many similar strips
   beginning at the town street beside the river and extending up over the
   hill to a line roughly corresponding with the modern hope street the
   throckmorton lot had later of course been much subdivided; and i
   became very assiduous in tracing that section through which back or
   benefit street was later run it had as rumor indeed said been the
   throckmorton graveyard; but as i examined the records more carefully i
   found that the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the
   north burial ground on the pawtucket west road

   then suddenly i cameby a rare piece of chance since it was not in
   the main body of records and might easily have been missed upon
   something which aroused my keenest eagerness fitting in as it did with
   several of the queerest phases of the affair it was the record of a
   lease in 1697 of a small tract of ground to an etienne roulet and
   wife at last the french element had appearedthat and another deeper
   element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses
   of my weird and heterogeneous readingand i feverishly studied the
   platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and
   partial straightening of back street between 1747 and 1758 i found
   what i had half expected that where the shunned house now stood the
   roulets had laid out their graveyard behind a onestory and attic
   cottage and that no record of any transfer of graves existed
   document indeed ended in much confusion; and i was forced to ransack
   both the rhode island historical society and shepley library before i
   could find a local door which the name of etienne roulet would unlock
   in the end i did find something; something of such vague but monstrous
   import that i set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned
   house itself with a new and excited minuteness

   the roulets it seemed had come in 1696 from east greenwich down the
   west shore of narragansett bay they were huguenots from canude and
   had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed
   them to settle in the town unpopularity had dogged them in east
   greenwich whither they had come in 1686 after the revocation of the
   edict of nantes and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended
   beyond mere racial and national prejudice or the land disputes which
   involved other french settlers with the english in rivalries which not
   even governor andros could quell but their ardent protestantismtoo
   ardent some whisperedand their evident distress when virtually
   driven from the village down the bay had moved the sympathy of the
   town fathers here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the
   swarthy etienne roulet less apt at agriculture than at reading queer
   books and drawing queer diagrams was given a clerical post in the
   warehouse at pardon tillinghasts wharf far south in town street
   there had however been a riot of some sort later onperhaps forty
   years later after old roulets deathand no one seemed to hear of the
   family after that

   for a century and more it appeared the roulets had been well
   remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet
   life of a new england seaport etiennes son paul a surly fellow whose
   erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the
   family was particularly a source of speculation; and though providence
   never shared the witchcraft panics of her puritan neighbors it was
   freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at
   the proper time nor directed toward the proper object all this had
   undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old maria robbins
   what relation it had to the french ravings of rhoby harris and other
   inhabitants of the shunned house imagination or future discovery alone
   could determine i wondered how many of those who had known the legends
   realized that additional link with the terrible which my wider reading
   had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror whiich
   tells of the creature jacques roulet of caude who in 1598 was
   condemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake by
   the paris parliament and shut in a madhouse he had been found covered
   with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood shortly after the killing and
   rending of a boy by a pair of wolves one wolf was seen to lope away
   unhurt surely a pretty hearthside tale with a queer significance as
   to name and place; but i decided that the providence gossips could not
   have generally known of it had they known the coincidence of names
   would have brought some drastic and frightened actionindeed might
   not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which
   erased the roulets from the town?

   i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the
   unwholesome vegetation of the garden examining all the walls of the
   building and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor
   finally with carrington harriss permission i fitted a key to the
   disused door opening from the cellar directly upon benefit street
   preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than
   the dark stairs groundfloor hall and front door could give there
   where morbidity lurked most thickly i searched and poked during long
   afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed
   aboveground windows and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked
   door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside
   nothing new rewarded my effortsonly the same depressing mustiness and
   faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the
   floorand i fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously
   through the broken panes

   at length upon a suggestion of my uncles i decided to try the spot
   nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch
   over the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted
   halfphosphorescent fungi the place had dispirited me curiously that
   evening and i was almost prepared when i sawor thought i sawamidst
   the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the huddled
   form i had suspected from boyhood its clearness was astonishing and
   unprecedentedand as i watched i seemed to see again the thin
   yellowish shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy
   afternoon so many years before

   above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; a
   subtle sickish almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in
   the dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form
   gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the
   blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake it was truly
   horrible and the more so to me because of what i knew of the spot
   refusing to flee i watched it fadeand as i watched i felt that it
   was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than
   visible when i told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and
   after a tense hour of reflection arrived at a definite and drastic
   decision weighing in his mind the importance of the matter and the
   significance of our relation to it he insisted that we both testand
   if possible destroythe horror of the house by a joint night or nights
   of aggressive vigil in that musty and funguscursed cellar

                                      4

   on wednesday june 25 1919 after a proper notification of carrington
   harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find
   my uncle and i conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a
   folding camp cot together with some scientific mechanism of greater
   weight and intricacy these we placed in the cellar during the day
   screening the windows with paper and planning to return in the evening
   for our first vigil we had locked the door from the cellar to the
   ground floor; and having a key to the outside cellar door were
   prepared to leave our expensive and delicate apparatuswhich we had
   obtained secretly and at great costas many days as our vigils might
   be protracted it was our design to sit up together till very late and
   then watch singly till dawn in twohour stretches myself first and
   then my companion; the inactive member resting on the cot

   the natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments
   from the laboratories of brown university and the cranston street
   armory and instinctively assumed direction of our venture was a
   marvelous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man
   of eightyone elihu whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws
   he had preached as a physician and but for what happened later would
   be here in full vigor today only two persons suspected what did
   happencarrington harris and myself i had to tell harris because he
   owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it then too
   we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and i felt after my
   uncles going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally
   necessary public explanations he turned very pale but agreed to help
   me and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house

   to declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching
   would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous we were not as i
   have said in any sense childishly superstitious but scientific study
   and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three
   dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of
   substance and energy in this case an overwhelming preponderance of
   evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious
   existence of certain forces of great power and so far as the human
   point of view is concerned exceptional malignancy to say that we
   actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly
   inclusive statement rather must it be said that we were not prepared
   to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified
   modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very
   infrequently in threedimensional space because of its more intimate
   connection with other spatial units yet close enough to the boundary
   of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we for lack
   of a proper vantagepoint may never hope to understand

   in short it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array
   of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;
   traceable to one or another of the illfavored french settlers of two
   centuries before and still operative through rare and unknown laws of
   atomic and electronic motion that the family of roulet had possessed
   an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entitydark spheres which
   for normal folk hold only repulsion and terrortheir recorded history
   seemed to prove had not then the riots of those bygone
   seventeenthirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid
   brain of one or more of them notably the sinister paul rouletwhich
   obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob and
   continued to function in some multipledimensioned space along the
   original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the
   encroaching community?

   such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in
   the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity
   and intraatomic action one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of
   substance or energy formless or otherwise kept alive by imperceptible
   or immaterial subtractions from the lifeforce or bodily tissue and
   fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it
   penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself
   it might be actively hostile or it might be dictated merely by blind
   motives of selfpreservation in any case such a monster must of
   necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder whose
   extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the
   worlds life health and sanity

   what baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might
   encounter the thing no sane person had ever seen it and few had ever
   felt it definitely it might be pure energya form ethereal and
   outside the realm of substanceor it might be partly material; some
   unknown and equivocal mass of plasticity capable of changing at will
   to nebulous approximations of the solid liquid gaseous or tenuously
   unparticled states the anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor the
   form of the yellowish vapor and the curvature of the treeroots in
   some of the old tales all argued at least a remote and reminiscent
   connection with the human shape; but how representative or permanent
   that similarity might be none could say with any kind of certainty

   we had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted
   crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with
   peculiar screens and reflectors in case it proved intangible and
   opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations and a pair
   of military flamethrowers of the sort used in the world war in case
   it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical
   destructionfor like the superstitious exeter rustics we were
   prepared to burn the things heart out if heart existed to burn all
   this aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully
   arranged with reference to the cot and chairs and to the spot before
   the fireplace where the mold had taken strange shapes that suggestive
   patch by the way was only faintly visible when we placed our
   furniture and instruments and when we returned that evening for the
   actual vigil for a moment i half doubted that i had ever seen it in
   the more definitely limned formbut then i thought of the legends

   our cellar vigil began at ten p m daylight saving time and as it
   continued we found no promise of pertinent developments a weak
   filtered glow from the rainharassed streetlamps outside and a feeble
   phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within showed the dripping
   stone of the walls from which all traces of whitewash had vanished;
   the dank fetid and mildewtainted hard earth floor with its obscene
   fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools chairs and tables
   and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams
   of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins
   and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone
   staircase with ruined wooden handrail; and the crude and cavernous
   fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the
   pasrpresence of hooks and irons spit crane and a door to the dutch
   oventhese things and our austere cot and camp chairs and the heavy
   and intricate destructive machinery we had brought

   we had as in my own former explorations left the door to the street
   unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open
   in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with it was our
   idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever
   malign entity lurked there; and that being prepared we could dispose
   of the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we
   had recognized and observed it sufficiently how long it might require
   to evoke and extinguish the thing we had no notion it occurred to us
   too that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thing
   might appear no one could tell but we deemed the game worth the
   hazard and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the
   seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps
   defeat our entire purpose such was our frame of mind as we talkedfar
   into the night till my uncles growing drowsiness made me remind him
   to he down for his twohour sleep

   something like fear chilled me as i sat there in the small hours
   alonei say lone for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;
   perhaps more alone than he can realize my uncle breathed heavily his
   deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside and
   punctuated by another nerveracking sound of distant dripping water
   withinfor the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather and in
   this storm positively swamplike i studied the loose antique masonry
   of the walls in the funguslight and the feeble rays which stole in
   from the street through the screened window; and once when the noisome
   atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me i opened the door
   and looked up and down the street feasting my eyes on familiar sights
   and my nostrils on wholesome air still nothing occurred to reward my
   watching; and i yawned repeatedly fatigue getting the better of
   apprehension

   then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice he had
   turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of
   the first hour but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity
   occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities
   of a choking moan

   i turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so
   rising and crossing to the other side of the cot i again flashed the
   light to see if he seemed in any pain what i saw unnerved me most
   surprizingly considering its relative triviality it must have been
   merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature
   of our location and mission for surely the circumstance was not in
   itself frightful or unnatural it was merely that my uncles facial
   expression disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our
   situation prompted betrayed considerable agitation and seemed not at
   all characteristic of him his habitual expression was one of kindly
   and wellbred calm whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling
   within him i think on the whole that it was this variety which
   chiefly disturbed me my uncle as he gasped and tossed in increasing
   perturbation and with eyes that had now started open seemed not one
   but many men and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself

   all at once he commenced to mutter and i did not like the look of his
   mouth and teeth as he spoke the words were at first indistinguishable
   and thenwith a tremendous starti recognized something about them
   which filled me with icy fear till i recalled the breadth of my uncles
   education and the interminable translations he had made from
   anthropological and antiquarian articles in the revue des deux mondes
   for the venerable elihu whipple was muttering in french and the few
   phrases i could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he
   had ever adapted from the famous paris magazine

   suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleepers forehead and he
   leaped abruptly up half awake the jumble of french changed to a cry
   in english and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly my breath my
   breath! then the awakening became complete and with a subsidence of
   facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began
   to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance i could only surmise
   with a kind of awe

   he had he said floated oif from a very ordinary series of
   dreampictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he
   had ever read it was of this world and yet not of ita shadowy
   geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar
   things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations there was a
   suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon
   another; an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of
   space seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion in this
   kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snapshots
   if one might use the term of singular clearness but unaccountable
   heterogeneity

   once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit with a crowd
   of angry faces framed by straggling locks and threecornered hats
   frowning down on him again he seemed to be in the interior of a
   housean old house apparentlybut the details and inhabitants were
   constantly changing and he could never be certain of the faces or the
   furniture or even of the room itself since doors and windows seemed
   in just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects
   it was queerdamnably queerand my uncle spoke almost sheepishly as
   if half expecting not to be believed when he declared that of the
   strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris
   family and all the while there was a personal sensation of choking as
   if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and
   sought to possess itself of his vital processes

   i shuddered at the thought of those vital processes worn as they were
   by eightyone years of continuous functioning in conflict with unknown
   forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;
   but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams and that
   these uncomfortable visions could be at most no more than my uncles
   reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled
   our minds to the exclusion of all else

   conversation also soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and
   in time i yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber my uncle
   seemed now very wakeful and welcomed his period of watching even
   though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his alotted two
   hours

   sleep seized me quickly and i was at once haunted with dreams of the
   most disturbing kind i felt in my visions a cosmic and abysmal
   loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where
   i lay confined i seemed bound and gagged and taunted by the echoing
   yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood my uncles face
   came to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours and i
   recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream it was not a
   pleasant sleep and for a second i was not sorry for the echoing shriek
   which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and
   startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood
   out with more than natural clearness and reality

                                      5

   i had been lying with my face away from my uncles chair so that in
   this sudden flash of awakening i saw only the door to the street the
   window and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the
   room all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light
   brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street
   outside it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly
   not nearly strong enough to read an average book by but it cast a
   shadow of myself and the cot on the floor and had a yellowish
   penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity
   this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of
   my other senses were violently assailed for on my ears rang the
   reverberations of that shocking scream while my nostrils revolted at
   the stench which filled the place my mind as alert as my senses
   recognized the gravely unusual; and almost automatically i leaped up
   and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left
   trained on the moldy spot before the fireplace as i turned i dreaded
   what i was to see; for the scream had been in my uncles voice and i
   knew not against what menace i should have to defend him and myself

   yet after all the sight was worse than i had dreaded there are
   horrors beyond horrors and this was one of those nuclei of all
   dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and
   unhappy few out of the fungusridden earth steamed up a vaporous
   corpselight yellow and diseased which bubbled and lapped to a
   gigantic height in vague outlines half human and half monstrous
   through which i could see the chimney and fireplace beyond it was all
   eyeswolfish and mockingand the rugose insectlike head dissolved at
   the top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and
   finally vanished up the chimney i say that i saw this thing but it is
   only in conscious retrospection that i ever definitely traced its
   damnable approach to form at the time it was to me only a seething
   dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness enveloping and
   dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my
   attention was focussed that object was my unclethe venerable elihu
   whipplewho with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered
   at me and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this
   horror had brought

   it was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad i had drilled
   myself in preparation for the crucial moment and blind training saved
   me recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter
   or material chemistry and therefore ignoring the flamethrower which
   loomed on my left i threw on the current of the crookes tube
   apparatus and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness
   the strongest ether radiations which mans art can arouse from the
   spaces and fluids of nature there was a bluish haze and a frenzied
   sputtering and the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes
   but i saw the dimness was only that of contrast and that the waves
   from the machine had no effect whatever

   then in the midst of that demoniac spectacle i saw a fresh horror
   which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering
   toward that unlocked door to the quiet street careless of what
   abnormal terrors i loosed upon the world or what thoughts or judgments
   of men i brought down upon my head in that dim blend of blue and
   yellow the form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose
   essence eludes all description and in which there played across his
   vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive
   he was at once a devil and a multitude a charnelhouse and a pageant
   lit by the mixed and uncertain beams that gelatinous face assumed a
   dozena scorea hundredaspects; grinning as it sank to the ground
   on a body that melted like tallow in the caricatured likeness of
   legions strange and yet not strange

   i saw the features of the harris line masculine and feminine adult
   and infantile and other features old and young coarse and refined
   familiar and unfamiliar for a second there flashed a degraded
   counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad rhoby harris that i had seen in
   the school of design museum and another time i thought i caught the
   rawboned image of mercy dexter as i recalled her from a painting in
   carrington harriss house it was frightful beyond conception; toward
   the last when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered
   close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was
   spreading it seemed as though the shifting features fought against
   themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncles kindly
   face i like to think that he existed at that moment and that he tried
   to bid me farewell it seems to me i hiccupped a farewell from my own
   parched throat as i lurched out into the street; a thin stream of
   grease following me through the door to the raindrenched sidewalk

   the rest is shadowy and monstrous there was no one in the soaking
   street and in all the world there was no one i dared tell i walked
   aimlessly south past college hill and the athenæum down hopkins
   street and over the bridge to the business section where tall
   buildings seemed to guard me as modern material things guard the world
   from ancient and unwholesome wonder then gray dawn unfolded wetly from
   the east silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples and
   beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished
   and in the end i went wet hatless and dazed in the morning light
   and entered that awful door in benefit street which i had left ajar
   and which still swung cryptically in full sight of the early
   householders to whom i dared not speak

   the grease was gone for the moldy floor was porous and in front of
   the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubledup form traced in
   niter i looked at the cot the chairs the instruments my neglected
   hat and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle dazedness was uppermost
   and i could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality then
   thought trickled back and i knew that i had witnessed things more
   horrible than i had dreamed sitting down i tried to conjecture as
   nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened and how i might
   end the horror if indeed it had been real matter it seemed not to be
   nor ether nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind what then
   but some exotic emanation; some vampirish vapor such as exeter rustics
   tell of as lurking over certain churchyards? this i felt was the clue
   and again i looked at the floor before the fireplace where the mold and
   niter had taken strange forms

   in ten minutes my mind was made up and taking my hat i set out for
   home where i bathed ate and gave by telephone an order for a pickax
   a spade a military gasmask and six carboys of sulfuric acid all to
   be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house
   in benefit street after that i tried to sleep; and failing passed the
   hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract
   my mood

   at eleven a m the next day i commenced digging it was sunny weather
   and i was glad of that i was still alone for as much as i feared the
   unknown horror i sought there was more fear in the thought of telling
   anybody later i told harris only through sheer necessity and because
   he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so
   little toward belief as i turned up the stinking black earth in front
   of the fireplace my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from
   the white fungi which it severed i trembled at the dubious thoughts of
   what i might uncover some secrets of inner earth are not good for
   mankind and this seemed to me one of them

   my hand shook perceptibly but still i delved; after a while standing
   in the large hole i had made with the deepening of the hole which was
   about six feet square the evil smell increased; and i lost all doubt
   of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had
   cursed the house for over a century and a half i wondered what it
   would look likewhat its form and substance would be and how big it
   might have waxed through long ages of lifesucking at length i climbed
   out of the hole and dispersed the heapedup dirt then arranging the
   great carboys of acid around and near two sides so that when necessary
   i might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession after
   that i dumped earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly
   and donning my gasmask as the smell grew i was nearly unnerved at my
   proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit

   suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth i shuddered and
   made a motion as if to climb out of the hole which was now as deep as
   my neck then courage returned and i scraped away more dirt in the
   light of the electric torch i had provided the surface i uncovered was
   fishy and glassya kind of semiputrid congealed jelly with
   suggestions of translucency i scraped further and saw that it had
   form there was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over
   the exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft
   bluewhite stovepipe doubled in two its largest part some two feet in
   diameter still more i scraped and then abruptly i leaped out of the
   hole and away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting
   the heavy carboys and precipitating their corrosive contents one after
   another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality
   whose titan elbow i had seen

   the blinding maelstrom of greenishyellow vapor which surged
   tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended will
   never leave my memory all along the hill people tell of the yellow
   day when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste
   dumped in the providence river but i know how mistaken they are as to
   the source they tell too of the hideous roar which at the same time
   came from some disordered waterpipe or gas main underground^but again
   i could correct them if i dared it was unspeakably shocking and i do
   not see how i lived through it i did faint after emptying the fourth
   carboy which i had to handle after the fumes had began to penetrate my
   mask; but when i recovered i saw that the hole was emitting no fresh
   vapors

   the two remaining carboys i emptied down without particular result and
   after a time i felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit it
   was twilight before i was done but fear had gone out of the place the
   dampness was less fetid and all the strange fungi had withered to a
   kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ashlike along the floor
   one of earths nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there
   be a hell it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed
   thing and as i patted down the last spadeful of mold i shed the first
   of the many tears with which i have paid unaffected tribute to my
   beloved uncles memory

   the next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the
   shunned houses terraced garden and shortly afterward carrington
   harris rented the place it is still spectral but its strangeness
   fascinates me and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret
   when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment
   building the barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small
   sweet apples and last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs

   the silver key
   by h p lovecraft
   8524the silver keyh p lovecraft

   when randolph carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams
   prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly
   excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space and lovely
   unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age
   hardened upon him he felt those liberties slipping away little by
   little until at last he was cut off altogether no more could his
   galleys sail up the river oukranos past the gilded spires of thran or
   his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in kled where
   forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken
   under the moon
         he had read much of things as they are and talked with too many
   people wellmeaning philosophers had taught him to look into the
   logical relations of things and analyse the processes which shaped his
   thoughts and fancies wonder had gone away and he had forgotten that
   all life is only a set of pictures in the brain among which there is
   no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of
   inward dreamings and no cause to value the one above the other custom
   had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which
   tangibly and physically exists and had made him secretly ashamed to
   dwell in visions wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and
   childish and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying
   them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly
   on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again
   neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of the minds that
   flicker for a second now and then in the darkness
         they had chained him down to things that are and had then
   explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the
   world when he complained and longed to escape into twilight realms
   where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized
   associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and
   unquenchable delight they turned him instead toward the newfound
   prodigies of science bidding him find wonder in the atoms vortex and
   mystery in the skys dimensions and when he had failed to find these
   boons in things whose laws are known and measurable they told him he
   lacked imagination and was immature because he preferred
   dreamillusions to the illusions of our physical creation
         so carter had tried to do as others did and pretended that the
   common events and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the
   fantasies of rare and delicate souls he did not dissent when they told
   him that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real
   life is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of narath with its
   hundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony which he dimly remembered
   from his dreams; and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking
   sense of pity and tragedy
         once in a while though he could not help seeing how shallow
   fickle and meaningless all human aspirations are and how emptily our
   real impulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold
   then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him
   to use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw
   that the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and
   artificial and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in
   beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and
   purpose in this way he became a kind of humorist for he did not see
   that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true
   standard of consistency or inconsistency
         in the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle
   churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers for
   thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from
   life only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty the
   stale and prosy triteness and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims
   of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most
   of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it
   sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of
   a primal race confronting the unknown it wearied carter to see how
   solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which
   every step of their boasted science confuted and this misplaced
   seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient
   creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional
   outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy
         but when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths
   he found them even more ugly than those who had not they did not know
   that beauty lies in harmony and that loveliness of life has no
   standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams
   and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little
   spheres out of the rest of chaos they did not see that good and evil
   and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective
   whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers
   think and feel and whose finer details are different for every race
   and culture instead they either denied these things altogether or
   transferred them to the crude vague instincts which they shared with
   the beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously
   out in pain ugliness and disproportion yet filled with a ludicrous
   pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which
   still held them they had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety
   for those of license and anarchy
         carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their
   cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone while his
   reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to
   gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had
   discarded he saw that most of them in common with their castoff
   priestcraft could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning
   apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the
   crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty even
   when all nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal
   unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries warped and
   bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice freedom and
   consistency they cast off the old lore and the old way with the old
   beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were
   the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments and the sole
   guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or
   stable points of reference having lost these artificial settings
   their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at
   length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended
   usefulness noise and excitement barbaric display and animal
   sensation when these things palled disappointed or grew nauseous
   through revulsion they cultivated irony and bitterness and found
   fault with the social order never could they realize that their brute
   foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their
   elders and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the
   next calm lasting beauty comes only in a dream and this solace the
   world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the
   secrets of childhood and innocence
         amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest carter tried to live
   as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage with his dreams
   fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything
   but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and
   station he walked impassive through the cities of men and sighed
   because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow
   sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the
   first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once
   known and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew
   how to find travel was only a mockery; and even the great war stirred
   him but little though he served from the first in the foreign legion
   of france for a while he sought friends but soon grew weary of the
   crudeness of their emotions and the sameness and earthiness of their
   visions he felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and
   out of touch with him for they would not have understood his mental
   life that is none but his grandfather and greatuncle christopher
   could and they were long dead
         then he began once more the writing of books which he had left
   off when dreams first failed him but here too was there no
   satisfaction or fulfillment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind
   and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore ironic
   humor dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared and the earthy
   fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in
   his faery gardens the convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on
   his characters while the myth of an important reality and significant
   human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thinveiled
   allegory and cheap social satire his new novels were successful as his
   old ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to
   please an empty herd he burned them and ceased his writing they were
   very graceful novels in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he
   lightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all
   their life away
         it was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion and
   dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote
   for the commonplace most of these however soon showed their poverty
   and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are
   as dry and inflexible as those of science yet without even the slender
   palliative of truth to redeem them gross stupidity falsehood and
   muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind
   trained above their own level so carter bought stranger books and
   sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving
   into arcana of consciousness that few have trod and learning things
   about the secret pits of life legend and immemorial antiquity which
   disturbed him ever afterward he decided to live on a rarer plane and
   furnished his boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for
   each hung in appropriate colours furnished with befitting books and
   objects and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light
   heat sound taste and odour
         once he heard of a man in the south who was shunned and feared
   for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay
   tablets smuggled from india and arabia him he visited living with him
   and sharing his studies for seven years till horror overtook them one
   midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard and only one emerged
   where two had entered then he went back to arkham the terrible
   witchhaunted old town of his forefathers in new england and had
   experiences in the dark amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel
   roofs which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a
   wildminded ancestor but these horrors took him only to the edge of
   reality and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth;
   so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world
   grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dreams
         having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real
   things carter spent his days in retirement and in wistful disjointed
   memories of his dreamfilled youth he thought it rather silly that he
   bothered to keep on living at all and got from a south american
   acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without
   suffering inertia and force of habit however caused him to defer
   action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times
   taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house
   as it was in his early boyhood  purple panes victorian furniture and
   all
         with the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered
   for his relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and
   sophistication seem very distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of
   magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers for years
   those slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of everyday
   things as the commonest slumbers know but now there returned a flicker
   of something stranger and wilder; something of vaguely awesome
   imminence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his
   childhood days and made him think of little inconsequential things he
   had long forgotten he would often awake calling for his mother and
   grandfather both in their graves a quarter of a century
         then one night his grandfather reminded him of the key the grey
   old scholar as vivid as in life spoke long and earnestly of their
   ancient line and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive
   men who composed it he spoke of the flameeyed crusader who learnt
   wild secrets of the saracens that held him captive; and of the first
   sir randolph carter who studied magic when elizabeth was queen he
   spoke too of that edmund carter who had just escaped hanging in the
   salem witchcraft and who had placed in an antique box a great silver
   key handed down from his ancestors before carter awaked the gentle
   visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of
   archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two
   centuries
         in the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it remote
   and forgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest it was about a
   foot square and its gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not
   marvel no person since edmund carter had dared to open it it gave
   forth no noise when shaken but was mystic with the scent of
   unremembered spices that it held a key was indeed only a dim legend
   and randolph carters father had never known such a box existed it was
   bound in rusty iron and no means was provided for working the
   formidable lock carter vaguely understood that he would find within it
   some key to the lost gate of dreams but of where and how to use it his
   grandfather had told him nothing
         an old servant forced the carven lid shaking as he did so at the
   hideous faces leering from the blackened wood and at some unplaced
   familiarity inside wrapped in a discoloured parchment was a huge key
   of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any
   legible explanation there was none the parchment was voluminous and
   held only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an
   antique reed carter recognized the characters as those he had seen on
   a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the
   south who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery the man had
   always shivered when he read this scroll and carter shivered now
         but he cleaned the key and kept it by him nightly in its
   aromatic box of ancient oak his dreams were meanwhile increasing in
   vividness and though showing him none of the strange cities and
   incredible gardens of the old days were assuming a definite cast whose
   purpose could not be mistaken they were calling him back along the
   years and with the mingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him
   toward some hidden and ancestral source then he knew he must go into
   the past and merge himself with old things and day after day he
   thought of the hills to the north where haunted arkham and the rushing
   miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay
         in the brooding fire of autumn carter took the old remembered way
   past graceful lines of rolling hill and stonewalled meadow distant
   vale and hanging woodland curving road and nestling farmstead and the
   crystal windings of the miskatonic crossed here and there by rustic
   bridges of wood or stone at one bend he saw the group of giant elms
   among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before
   and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them then there was
   the crumbling farmhouse of old goody fowler the witch with its little
   evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north
   side he speeded up his car as he passed it and did not slacken till
   he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her
   were born and where the old white house still looked proudly across
   the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant
   valley with the distant spires of kingsport on the horizon and hints
   of the archaic dreamladen sea in the farthest background
         then came the steeper slope that held the old carter place he had
   not seen in over forty years afternoon was far gone when he reached
   the foot and at the bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread
   countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured
   out by a western sun all the strangeness and expectancy of his recent
   dreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape and he
   thought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced
   out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their
   tumbled walls and clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of
   purple hills beyond hills and the spectral wooded valley dipping down
   in shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled
   among swollen and distorted roots
         something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm
   he was seeking so he left his car at the edge of the forest and
   putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill woods
   now engulfed him utterly though he knew the house was on a high knoll
   that cleared the trees except to the north he wondered how it would
   look for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect
   since the death of his strange greatuncle christopher thirty years
   before in his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there and
   had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard
         shadows thickened around him for the night was near once a gap
   in the trees opened up to the right so that he saw off across leagues
   of twilight meadow and spied the old congregational steeple on central
   hill in kingsport; pink with the last flush of day the panes of the
   little round windows blazing with reflected fire then when he was in
   deep shadow again he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have
   come from childish memory alone since the old white church had long
   been torn down to make room for the congregational hospital he had
   read of it with interest for the paper had told about some strange
   burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath
         through his puzzlement a voice piped and he started again at its
   familiarity after long years old benijah corey had been his uncle
   christophers hired man and was aged even in those faroff times of
   his boyhood visits now he must be well over a hundred but that piping
   voice could come from no one else he could distinguish no words yet
   the tone was haunting and unmistakable to think that old benijy
   should still be alive!
         mister randy! mister randy! wharbe ye? dye want to skeer yer
   aunt marthy plumb to death? haint she tuld ye to keep nigh the place
   in the arternoon an git back afur dark? randy! ran dee! hes the
   beatinest boy fer runnin off in the woods i ever see; haff the time
   asettin moonin raound that snakeden in the upper timberlot!  hey
   yew ran  dee!
         randolph carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand
   across his eyes something was queer he had been somewhere he ought
   not to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not
   belonged and was now inexcusably late he had not noticed the time on
   the kingsport steeple though he could easily have made it out with his
   pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange
   and unprecedented he was not sure he had his little telescope with
   him and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see no it was not
   there but there was the big silver key he had found in a box
   somewhere uncle chris had told him something odd once about an old
   unopened box with a key in it but aunt martha had stopped the story
   abruptly saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was
   already too full of queer fancies he tried to recall just where he had
   found the key but something seemed very confused he guessed it was in
   the attic at home in boston and dimly remembered bribing parks with
   half his weeks allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet about
   it; but when he remembered this the face of parks came up very
   strangely as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk
   little cockney
         ran  dee! ran  dee! hi! hi! randy!
         a swaying lantern came around the black bend and old benijah
   pounced on the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim
         durn ye boy so thar ye be! aint ye got a tongue in yer head
   that ye cant answer a body! i ben callin this haff hour an ye must
   a heerd me long ago! dunt ye know yer aunt marthys all afidget over
   yer bein off arter dark? wait till i tell yer uncle chris when he gits
   hum! yed orta know these here woods aint no fitten place to be
   traipsin this hour! theys things abroad what dunt do nobody no good
   as my gransir knowed afur me come mister randy or hannah wunt keep
   supper no longer!
         so randolph carter was marched up the road where wondering stars
   glimmered through high autumn boughs and dogs barked as the yellow
   light of smallpaned windows shone out at the farther turn and the
   pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof
   stood black against the dim west aunt martha was in the doorway and
   did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in she knew
   uncle chris well enough to expect such things of the carter blood
   randolph did not show his key but ate his supper in silence and
   protested only when bedtime came he sometimes dreamed better when
   awake and he wanted to use that key
         in the morning randolph was up early and would have run off to
   the upper timberlot if uncle chris had not caught him and forced him
   into his chair by the breakfast table he looked impatiently around the
   lowpitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and
   cornerposts and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the
   leaded panes of the rear window the trees and the hills were close to
   him and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his true
   country
         then when he was free he felt in his blouse pocket for the key;
   and being reassured skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond
   where the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless
   knoll the floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious and great
   lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like druid
   monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove once
   in his ascent randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little
   way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and aegipans and
   dryads
         then he came to the strange cave in the forest slope the dreaded
   snakeden which country folk shunned and away from which benijah had
   warned him again and again it was deep; far deeper than anyone but
   randolph suspected for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost
   black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond  a haunting
   sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of
   conscious artifice on this occasion he crawled in as usual lighting
   his way with matches filched from the sittingroom matchsafe and
   edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even
   to himself he could not tell why he approached the farther wall so
   confidently or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as
   he did so but on he went and when he danced back to the house that
   night he offered no excuses for his lateness nor heeded in the least
   the reproofs he gained for ignoring the noontide dinnerhorn
   altogether
         now it is agreed by all the distant relatives of randolph carter
   that something occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year
   his cousin ernest b aspinwall esq of chicago is fully ten years
   his senior; and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn
   of 1883 randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can
   ever have beheld and stranger still were some of the qualities which
   he showed in relation to very mundane things he seemed in fine to
   have picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to things
   which though at the time without meaning were later found to justify
   the singular impressions in subsequent decades as new inventions new
   names and new events appeared one by one in the book of history
   people would now and then recall wonderingly how carter had years
   before let fall some careless word of undoubted connection with what
   was then far in the future he did not himself understand these words
   or know why certain things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied
   that some unremembered dream must be responsible it was as early as
   1897 that he turned pale when some traveller mentioned the french town
   of belloyensanterre and friends remembered it when he was almost
   mortally wounded there in 1916 while serving with the foreign legion
   in the great war
         carters relatives talk much of these things because he has
   lately disappeared his little old servant parks who for years bore
   patiently with his vagaries last saw him on the morning he drove off
   alone in his car with a key he had recently found parks had helped him
   get the key from the old box containing it and had felt strangely
   affected by the grotesque carvings on the box and by some other odd
   quality he could not name when carter left he had said he was going
   to visit his old ancestral country around arkham
         half way up elm mountain on the way to the ruins of the old
   carter place they found his motor set carefully by the roadside; and
   in it was a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the
   countrymen who stumbled on it the box held only a queer parchment
   whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher
   or identify rain had long effaced any possible footprints though
   boston investigators had something to say about evidences of
   disturbances among the fallen timbers of the carter place it was they
   averred as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant
   period a common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the
   hillside beyond cannot be identified as belonging to the missing man
         there is talk of apportioning randolph carters estate among his
   heirs but i shall stand firmly against this course because i do not
   believe he is dead there are twists of time and space of vision and
   reality which only a dreamer can divine; and from what i know of
   carter i think he has merely found a way to traverse these mazes
   whether or not he will ever come back i cannot say he wanted the
   lands of dream he had lost and yearned for the days of his childhood
   then he found a key and i somehow believe he was able to use it to
   strange advantage
         i shall ask him when i see him for i expect to meet him shortly
   in a certain dreamcity we both used to haunt it is rumoured in
   ulthar beyond the river skai that a new king reigns on the opal
   throne of ilekvad that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow
   cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and
   finny gnorri build their singular labyrinths and i believe i know how
   to interpret this rumour certainly i look forward impatiently to the
   sight of that great silver key for in its cryptical arabesques there
   may stand symbolised all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal
   cosmos

   1364032the slaying of the monsterby h p lovecraft and r h
   barlow1933

   great was the clamour in laen; for smoke had been spied in the hills of
   the dragon that surely meant the stirrings of the monsterthe monster
   who spat lava and shook the earth as he writhed in its depths and when
   the men of laen spoke together they swore to slay the monster and keep
   his fiery breath from searing their minaretstudded city and toppling
   their alabaster domes

   so it was that by torchlight gathered fully a hundred of the little
   people prepared to battle the evil one in his hidden fasthold with
   the coming of night they began marching in ragged columns into the
   foothills beneath the fulgent lunar rays ahead a burning cloud shone
   clearly through the purple dusk a guide to their goal

   for the sake of truth it is to be recorded that their spirits sank low
   long ere they sighted the foe and as the moon grew dim and the coming
   of the dawn was heralded by gaudy clouds they wished themselves more
   than ever at home dragon or no dragon but as the sun rose they
   cheered up slightly and shifting their spears resolutely trudged the
   remaining distance

   clouds of sulphurous smoke hung palllike over the world darkening
   even the newrisen sun and always replenished by sullen puffs from the
   mouth of the monster little tongues of hungry flame made the laenians
   move swiftly over the hot stones but where is the dragon?? whispered
   onefearfully and hoping it would not accept the query as an
   invitation in vain they lookedthere was nothing solid enough to
   slay

   so shouldering their weapons they wearily returned home and there set
   up a stone tablet graven to this effectbeing troubled by a fierce
   monster the brave citizens of laen did set upon it and slay it in its
   fearful lair saving the land from a dreadful doom these words were
   hard to read when we dug that stone from its deep ancient layers of
   encrusting lava

   the sorcery of aphlar
   by duane w rimel
      sister projects sister projects: data item

   1347100the sorcery of aphlarduane w rimel

   the council of twelve seated on the jewelled celestial dais ordered
   that aphlar be cast from the gates of belhazen he sat too much
   alone they decreed and brooded when toil should have been his lot
   and in his obscure and hidden delvings he read all too frequently those
   papyri of elder æons which reposed in the guothic shrine and were to be
   consulted only for rare and special purposes

   the twilight city of belhazen had climbed backward in its knowledge
   no longer did philosophers sit upon street corners speaking wise words
   to the populace for stupid ignorance ruled within the crumbling and
   immemorially ancient walls where once the wisdom of the stars
   abounded only feebleness and desolation now lay upon the place
   spreading like a monstrous blight and sucking foul nurture from the
   stupid dwellers and out of the waters of the oll that meandered from
   the mountains of azlakka to pass by the aged city there rose often
   great clouds of pestilence that racked the people sorely leaving them
   pale and near to dying all this their loss of wisdom brought and now
   the council had sent their last and greatest wise man from them

   aphlar wandered to the mountains far above the city and built a cavern
   for protection from the summer heat and winter chill there he read his
   scrolls in silence and told his mighty wisdom to the wind about the
   crags and to the swallows on the wing all day he sat and watched below
   or drew queer drawings on small bits of stone and chanted to them for
   he knew that someday men would seek the cave and slay him the cunning
   of the twelve did not mislead him had not the last exiled wise mans
   screams rent the night two moonrounds before when people thought him
   safely gone? had not his own eyes seen the priests swordslashed form
   floating by in the poison waters? he knew no lion had killed old azik
   let the council say what they might does a lion slash with a sword and
   leave his prey uneaten?

   through many seasons aphlar sat upon the mountain gazing at the muddy
   oll as it wound into the misty distance to the land where none ever
   ventured he spoke his words of wisdom to the snails that worked in the
   ground by his feet they seemed to understand and waved their slimy
   feelers before they sank beneath the sand again on moonlit nights he
   climbed the hill above his cave and made strange offerings to the
   moongod ale; arid when the nightbirds heard the sound they drew close
   and listened to the whispering and when queer winged things flapped
   across the darkened sky and loomed up dimly against the moon aphlar was
   content those which he had addressed had heeded his beckoning his
   thoughts were always far away and his prayers were offered to the pale
   fancies of dusk

   then one day past noontide aphlar rose from his earthen chair and
   strode down the rock mountainside his eyes heeding not the rotten
   stonewalled city held steadfast to the river when he drew near its
   muddy brink he paused and looked up the bosom of the stream a small
   object floated near the rushes and this aphlar rescued with tender and
   curious care then wrapping the thing in the folds of his robe he
   climbed up again to his cave in the hills all day he sat and gazed
   upon the object; rummaging now and then in his musty chronicles and
   muttering awful syllables as he drew faint figures on a piece of
   parchment

   that night the gibbous moon rose high but aphlar did not climb above
   his dwelling queer nightbirds flew past the caverns mouth chirped
   eerily and fled away into the shadows

   many days passed before the council sent their messengers of murder;
   but at last the time was thought ripe and seven darkbrowed men stole
   away to the hills yet when that grim seven ventured within the cave
   they saw not the wise man aphlar instead small blades of grass were
   sprouting in his natural chair of earth all about lay papyri dim and
   musty with faint figures drawn upon them the seven shuddered and left
   forthwith when they beheld these things but as the last man
   tremblingly withdrew he saw a round and unknown thing lying on the
   ground he picked it up and his fellows drew close in curiosity; but
   they saw upon it only alien symbols which they could not read yet
   which made them shrink and quaver without knowing why then he who had
   found it cast it quickly over the steep precipice beside him but no
   sound came from the slope below whereon it should have fallen and the
   thrower trembled fearing many things that are not known but only
   whispered about then when he told how the sphere he had held was
   without the weight a thing of stone should have; how it was like to
   have floated on air as the thistledown floats; he and the six with him
   slunk as one from the spot and swore it was a place accursed

   but after they had gone a snail crawled slowly from a sandy crevice and
   slid intently over to where the blades of grass were growing and when
   it reached the spot two slimy feelers stretched forth and bent oddly
   downward as if eager to watch forever the winding river

   the statement of randolph carter

   by h p lovecraft

   telling ghost stories in dark and lonely places is an honored
   tradition as a rule such tales recited from memory are not the type
   that make for literaturethey are terse grim and usually described
   as true occurrences the works of the greats of modern fantasysave
   perhaps for ambrose bierceare not easily adapted to such recitation;
   they are too complex or too esoteric but here is an h p lovecraft
   tale that lends itself to recitation not word for word but the plot
   idea is one to be worked into a midnight tale your editor has related
   it several timesusually on deserted rural roadswith marked effect

   i repeat to you gentlemen that your inquisition is fruitless detain
   me here for ever if you will; confine or execute me if you must have a
   victim to propitiate the illusion you call justice; but i can say no
   more than i have said already everything that i can remember i have
   told with perfect candor nothing has been distorted or concealed and
   if anything remains vague it is only because of the dark cloud which
   has come over my mindthat cloud and the nebulous nature of the
   horrors which brought it upon me

   again i say i do not know what has become of harley warren though i
   thinkalmost hopethat he is in peaceful oblivion if there be
   anywhere so blessed a thing it is true that i have for five years been
   his closest friend and a partial sharer of his terrible researches
   into the unknown i will not deny though my memory is uncertain and
   indistinct that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he
   says on the gainsville pike walking toward big cypress swamp at half
   past eleven on that awful night that we bore electric lanterns
   spades and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments i will
   even affirm; for these things all played a part in the single hideous
   scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection but of what
   followed and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of
   the swamp next morning i must insist that i know nothing save what i
   have told you over and over again you say to me that there is nothing
   in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful
   episode i reply that i knew nothing beyond what i saw vision or
   nightmare it may have beenvision or nightmare i fervently hope it
   wasyet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those
   shocking hours after we left the sight of men and why harley warren
   did not return he or his shadeor some nameless thing i cannot
   describealone can tell

   as i have said before the weird studies of harley warren were well
   known to me and to some extent shared by me of his vast collection of
   strange rare books on forbidden subjects i have read all that are
   written in the languages of which i am master; but these are few as
   compared with those in languages i cannot understand most i believe
   are in arabic; and the fiendinspired book which brought on the
   endthe book which he carried in his pocket out of the worldwas
   written in characters whose like i never saw elsewhere warren would
   never tell me just what was in that book as to the nature of our
   studiesmust i say again that i no longer retain full comprehension?
   it seems to me rather merciful that i do not for they were terrible
   studies which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than
   through actual inclination warren always dominated me and sometimes i
   feared him i remember how i shuddered at his facial expression on the
   night before the awful happening when he talked so incessantly of his
   theory why certain corpses never decay but rest firm and fat in their
   tombs for a thousand years but i do not fear him now for i suspect
   that he has known horrors beyond my ken now i fear for him

   once more i say that i have no clear idea of our object on that night
   certainly it had much to do with something in the book which warren
   carried with himthat ancient book in undecipherable characters which
   had come to him from india a month beforebut i swear i do not know
   what it was that we expected to find your witness says he saw us at
   half past eleven on the gainsville pike headed for big cypress swamp
   this is probably true but i have no distinct memory of it the picture
   seared into my soul is of one scene only and the hour must have been
   long after midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the
   vaporous heavens

   the place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that i trembled at the
   manifold signs of immemorial years it was in a deep damp hollow
   overgrown with rank grass moss and curious creeping weeds and filled
   with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with
   rotting stone on every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude
   and i seemed haunted by the notion that warren and i were the first
   living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries over the
   valleys rim a wan waning crescent moon peered through the noisome
   vapors that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs and by its
   feeble wavering beams i could distinguish a repellent array of antique
   slabs urns cenotaphs and mausoleum facades; all crumbling
   mossgrown and moisturestained and partly concealed by the gross
   luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation

   my first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible
   necropolis concerns the act of pausing with warren before a certain
   halfobliterated sepulcher and of throwing down some burdens which we
   seemed to have been carrying i now observed that i had with me an
   electric lantern and two spades whilst my companion was supplied with
   a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit no word was uttered
   for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without delay we
   seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass weeds and
   drifted earth from the flat archaic mortuary after uncovering the
   entire surface which consisted of three immense granite slabs we
   stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene; and warren
   appeared to make some mental calculations then he returned to the
   sepulcher and using his spade as a lever sought to pry up the slab
   lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its
   day he did not succeed and motioned to me to come to his assistance
   finally our combined strength loosened the stone which we raised and
   tipped to one side

   the removal of the slab revealed a black aperture from which rushed an
   effluence of miasmal gases so nauseous that we started back in horror
   after an interval however we approached the pit again and found the
   exhalations less unbearable our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight
   of stone steps dripping with some detestable ichor of the inner earth
   and bordered by moist walls encrusted with niter and now for the first
   time my memory records verbal discourse warren addressing me at length
   in his mellow tenor voice; a voice singularly unperturbed by our
   awesome surroundings

   im sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface he said but it
   would be a crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there
   you cant imagine even from what you have read and from what ive told
   you the things i shall have to see and do its fiendish work carter
   and i doubt if any man without ironclad sensibilities could ever see it
   through and come up alive and sane i dont wish to offend you and
   heaven knows id be glad enough to have you with me; but the
   responsibility is in a certain sense mine and i couldnt drag a bundle
   of nerves like you down to probable death or madness i tell you you
   cant imagine what the thing is really like! but i promise to keep you
   informed over the telephone of every moveyou see ive enough wire
   here to reach to the center of the earth and back!

   i can still hear in memory those coolly spoken words; and i can still
   remember my remonstrances i seemed desperately anxious to accompany my
   friend into those sepulchral depths yet he proved inflexibly obdurate
   at one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if i remained
   insistent; a threat which proved effective since he alone held the key
   to the thing all this i can still remember though i no longer know
   what manner of thing we sought after he had obtained my reluctant
   acquiescence in his design warren picked up the reel of wire and
   adjusted the instruments at his nod i took one of the latter and
   seated myself upon an aged discolored gravestone close by the newly
   uncovered aperture then he shook my hand shouldered the coil of wire
   and disappeared within that indescribable ossuary

   for a minute i kept sight of the glow of his lantern and heard the
   rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him; but the glow soon
   disappeared abruptly as if a turn in the stone staircase had been
   encountered and the sound died away almost as quickly i was alone
   yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated
   surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent
   moon

   in the lone silence of that hoary and deserted city of the dead my
   mind conceived the most ghastly fantasies and illusions; and the
   grotesque shrines and monoliths seemed to assume a hideous
   personalitya halfsentience amorphous shadows seemed to lurk in the
   darker recesses of the weedchoked hollow and to flit as in some
   blasphemous ceremonial procession past the portals of the mouldering
   tombs in the hillside; shadows which could not have been cast by that
   pallid peering crescent moon

   i constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern
   and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone;
   but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing then a faint
   clicking came from the instrument and i called down to my friend in a
   tense voice apprehensive as i was i was nevertheless unprepared for
   the words which came up from that uncanny vault in accents more alarmed
   and quivering than any i had heard before from harley warren he who
   had so calmly left me a little while previously now called from below
   in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriek:

   god! if you could see what i am seeing!

   i could not answer speechless i could only wait then came the
   frenzied tones again:

   carter its terriblemonstrousunbelievable!

   this time my voice did not fail me and i poured into the transmitter a
   flood of excited questions terrified i continued to repeat warren
   what is it? what is it?

   once more came the voice of my friend still hoarse with fear and now
   apparently tinged with despair:

   i cant tell you carter! its too utterly beyond thoughti dare not
   tell youno man could know it and livegreat god! i never dreamed of
   this!

   stillness again save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering
   inquiry then the voice of warren in a pitch of wilder consternation:

   carter! for the love of god put back the slab and get out of this if
   you can! quick!leave everything else and make for the outsideits
   your only chance! do as i say and dont ask me to explain!

   i heard yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions around me
   were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows; below me some peril
   beyond the radius of the human imagination but my friend was in
   greater danger than i and through my fear i felt a vague resentment
   that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such
   circumstances more clicking and after a pause a piteous cry from
   warren:

   beat it! for gods sake put back the slab and beat it carter!

   something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion
   unleashed my faculties i formed and shouted a resolution warren
   brace up! im coming down! but at this offer the tone of my auditor
   changed to a scream of utter despair:

   dont! you cant understand! its too lateand my own fault put back
   the slab and runtheres nothing else you or anyone can do now!

   the tone changed again this time acquiring a softer quality as of
   hopeless resignation yet it remained tense through anxiety for me

   quickbefore its too late!

   i tried not to heed him; tried to break through the paralysis which
   held me and to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid but his next
   whisper found me still held inert in the chains of stark horror

   carterhurry! its no useyou must gobetter one than twothe
   slab

   a pause more clicking then the faint voice of warren:

   nearly over nowdont make it hardercover up those damned steps and
   run for your lifeyoure losing timeso long carterwont see you
   again

   here warrens whisper swelled into a cry; a cry that gradually rose to
   a shriek fraught with all the horror of the ages:

   curse these hellish thingslegionsmy god! beat it! beat it! beat
   it!

   after that was silence i know not how many interminable eons i sat
   stupefied; whispering muttering calling screaming into that
   telephone over and over again through those eons i whispered and
   muttered called shouted and screamed warren! warren! answer
   meare you there?

   and then there came to me the crowning horror of allthe unbelievable
   unthinkable almost unmentionable thing i have said that eons seemed
   to elapse after warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning and
   that only my own cries now broke the hideous silence but after a while
   there was a further clicking in the receiver and i strained my ears to
   listen again i called down warren are you there? and in answer
   heard the thing which has brought this cloud over my mind i do not
   try gentlemen to account for that thingthat voicenor can i
   venture to describe it in detail since the first words took away my
   consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of
   my awakening in the hospital shall i say that the voice was deep;
   hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied? what shall
   i say? it was the end of my experience and is the end of my story i
   heard it and knew no moreheard it as i sat petrified in that unknown
   cemetery in the hollow amidst the crumbling stones and the falling
   tombs the rank vegetation and the miasmal vaporsheard it well up
   from the innermost depths of that damnable open sepulcher as i watched
   amorphous necrophagous shadows dance beneath an accursed waning moon

   and this is what it said:

   you fool warren is dead!

   in the morning mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond
   kingsport white and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers
   the clouds full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan and
   later in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets the clouds
   scatter bits of those dreams that men shall not live without rumor of
   old strange secrets and wonders that planets tell planets alone in the
   night when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons and conchs in
   seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones then great
   eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore and oceanward eyes on tile
   rocks see only a mystic whiteness as if the cliffs rim were the rim
   of all earth and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether
   of faery

   now north of archaic kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious
   terrace on terrace till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a gray
   frozen windcloud alone it is a bleak point jutting in limitless
   space for there the coast turns sharp where the great miskatonic pours
   out of the plains past arkham bringing woodland legends and little
   quaint memories of new englands hills the seafolk of kingsport look
   up at that cliff as other seafolk look up at the polestar and time
   the nights watches by the way it hides or shows the great bear
   cassiopeia and the dragon among them it is one with the firmament and
   truly it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun

   some of the cliffs they love as that whose grotesque profile they call
   father neptune or that whose pillared steps they term the causeway;
   but this one they fear because it is so near the sky the portuguese
   sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see
   it and the old yankees believe it would be a much graver matter than
   death to climb it if indeed that were possible nevertheless there is
   an ancient house on that cliff and at evening men see lights in the
   smallpaned windows

   the ancient house has always been there and people say one dwells
   within who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep and
   perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliffs
   rim becomes the rim of all earth and solemn buoys toll free in the
   white aether of faery this they tell from hearsay for that forbidding
   crag is always unvisited and natives dislike to train telescopes on
   it summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars but
   have never seen more than the gray primeval roof peaked and shingled
   whose eaves come nearly to the gray foundations and the dim yellow
   light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the
   dusk these summer people do not believe that the same one has lived in
   the ancient house for hundreds of years but can not prove their heresy
   to any real kingsporter even the terrible old man who talks to leaden
   pendulums in bottles buys groceries with centuried spanish gold and
   keeps stone idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in water
   street can only say these things were the same when his grandfather was
   a boy and that must have been inconceivable ages ago when belcher or
   shirley or pownall or bernard was governor of his majestys province of
   the massachusettsbay

   then one summer there came a philosopher into kingsport his name was
   thomas olney and he taught ponderous things in a college by
   narragansett bay with stout wife and romping children he came and his
   eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many years and
   thinking the same welldisciplined thoughts he looked at the mists
   from the diadem of father neptune and tried to walk into their white
   world of mystery along the titan steps of the causeway morning after
   morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the worlds rim at the
   cryptical aether beyond listening to spectral bells and the wild cries
   of what might have been gulls then when the mist would lift and the
   sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers he would sigh and
   descend to the town where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up
   and down hill and study the crazy tottering gables and oddpillared
   doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy seafolk
   and he even talked with the terrible old man who was not fond of
   strangers and was invited into his fearsomely archaic cottage where
   low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting
   soliloquies in the dark small hours

   of course it was inevitable that olney should mark the gray unvisited
   cottage in the sky on that sinister northward crag which is one with
   the mists and the firmament always over kingsport it hung and always
   its mystery sounded in whispers through kingsports crooked alleys the
   terrible old man wheezed a tale that his father had told him of
   lightning that shot one night up from that peaked cottage to the clouds
   of higher heaven; and granny orne whose tiny gambrelroofed abode in
   ship street is all covered with moss and ivy croaked over something
   her grandmother had heard at secondhand about shapes that flapped out
   of the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that
   unreachable place  for the door is set close to the edge of the crag
   toward the ocean and glimpsed only from ships at sea

   at length being avid for new strange things and held back by neither
   the kingsporters fear nor the summer boarders usual indolence olney
   made a very terrible resolve despite a conservative training  or
   because of it for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown
    he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit
   the abnormally antique gray cottage in the sky very plausibly his
   saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached
   it from inland along the easier ridge beside the miskatonics estuary
   probably they traded in arkham knowing how little kingsport liked
   their habitation or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the
   kingsport side olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the
   great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things and
   became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on
   that beetling southern slope east and north it rose thousands of feet
   perpendicular from the water so only the western side inland and
   toward arkham remained

   one early morning in august olney set out to find a path to the
   inaccessible pinnacle he worked northwest along pleasant back roads
   past hoopers pond and the old brick powderhouse to where the pastures
   slope up to the ridge above the miskatonic and give a lovely vista of
   arkhams white georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow
   here he found a shady road to arkham but no trail at all in the
   seaward direction he wished woods and fields crowded up to the high
   bank of the rivers mouth and bore not a sign of mans presence; not
   even a stone wall or a straying cow but only the tall grass and giant
   trees and tangles of briars that the first indian might have seen as
   he climbed slowly east higher and higher above the estuary on his left
   and nearer and nearer the sea he found the way growing in difficulty
   till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed
   to reach the world outside and whether they came often to market in
   arkham

   then the trees thinned and far below him on his right he saw the hills
   and antique roofs and spires of kingsport even central hill was a
   dwarf from this height and he could just make out the ancient
   graveyard by the congregational hospital beneath which rumor said some
   terrible caves or burrows lurked ahead lay sparse grass and scrub
   blueberry bushes and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the
   thin peak of the dreaded gray cottage now the ridge narrowed and
   olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky south of him the frightful
   precipice above kingsport north of him the vertical drop of nearly a
   mile to the rivers mouth suddenly a great chasm opened before him
   ten feet deep so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop
   to a slanting floor and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in
   the opposite wall so this was the way the folk of the uncanny house
   journeyed betwixt earth and sky!

   when he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering but he
   clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as gray as
   the rock and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the
   seaward vapors and he perceived that there was no door on this
   landward end but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy
   bullseye panes leaded in seventeenth century fashion all around him
   was cloud and chaos and he could see nothing below the whiteness of
   illimitable space he was alone in the sky with this queer and very
   disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that
   the wall stood flush with the cliffs edge so that the single narrow
   door was not to be reached save from the empty aether he felt a
   distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain and it was very
   odd that shingles so wormeaten could survive or bricks so crumbled
   still form a standing chimney

   as the mist thickened olney crept around to the windows on the north
   and west and south sides trying them but finding them all locked he
   was vaguely glad they were locked because the more he saw of that
   house the less he wished to get in then a sound halted him he heard a
   lock rattle and a bolt shoot and a long creaking follow as if a heavy
   door were slowly and cautiously opened this was on the oceanward side
   that he could not see where the narrow portal opened on blank space
   thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves

   then there was heavy deliberate tramping in the cottage and olney
   heard the windows opening first on the north side opposite him and
   then on the west just around the corner next would come the south
   windows under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it
   must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the
   detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other
   when a fumbling came in the nearer casements he crept around to the
   west again flattening himself against the wall beside the now opened
   windows it was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come
   from the land nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined
   steps sounded again and olney edged round to the north; but before he
   could find a haven a voice called softly and he knew he must confront
   his host

   stuck out of the west window was a great blackbearded face whose eyes
   were phosphorescent with the imprint of unheardof sights but the
   voice was gentle and of a quaint olden kind so that olney did not
   shudder when a brown hand reached out to help him over the sill and
   into that low room of black oak wainscots and carved tudor furnishings
   the man was clad in very ancient garments and had about him an
   unplaceable nimbus of sealore and dreams of tall galleons olney does
   not recall many of the wonders he told or even who he was; but says
   that he was strange and kindly and filled with the magic of unfathomed
   voids of time and space the small room seemed green with a dim aqueous
   light and olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open
   but shut against the misty aether with dull panes like the bottoms of
   old bottles

   that bearded host seemed young yet looked out of eyes steeped in the
   elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvelous ancient things he
   related it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying
   he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky
   ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from
   the plain below and the day wore on and still olney listened to
   rumors of old times and far places and heard how the kings of atlantis
   fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in
   oceans floor and how the pillared and weedy temple of poseidon is
   still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships who knew by its sight that
   they are lost years of the titans were recalled but the host grew
   timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or
   even the elder ones were born and when the other gods came to dance on
   the peak of hathegkia in the stony desert near ulthar beyond the
   river skai

   it was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that
   ancient door of nailstudded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of
   white cloud olney started in fright but the bearded man motioned him
   to be still and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small
   peephole what he saw he did not like so pressed his fingers to his
   lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before
   returning to the ancient settle beside his guest then olney saw
   lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim
   windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved
   inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his host had not
   answered the knocking for there are strange objects in the great
   abyss and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet
   the wrong ones

   then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the
   table and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners and the
   bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer and lit tall candles
   in curiously wrought brass candlesticks frequently he would glance at
   the door as if he expected some one and at length his glance seemed
   answered by a singular rapping which must have followed some very
   ancient and secret code this time he did not even glance through the
   peephole but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt unlatching
   the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist

   and then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room
   from the deep all the dreams and memories of earths sunken mighty
   ones and golden flames played about weedy locks so that olney was
   dazzled as he did them homage tridentbearing neptune was there and
   sportive tritons and fantastic nereids and upon dolphins backs was
   balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the gay and awful form of
   primal nodens lord of the great abyss and the conchs of the tritons
   gave weird blasts and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on
   the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black seacaves
   then hoary nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped olney and his
   host into the vast shell whereat the conchs and the gongs set up a
   wild and awesome clamor and out into the limitless aether reeled that
   fabulous train the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of
   thunder

   all night in kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and
   the mists gave them glimpses of it and when toward the small hours the
   little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster and
   olneys children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of
   baptists and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and
   rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning then dawn swam dripping and
   mistwreathed out of the sea and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices
   of white aether and at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as olney
   dry and lightfooted climbed down from the cliffs to antique kingsport
   with the look of far places in his eyes he could not recall what he
   had dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit or say
   how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet nor could he
   talk of these matters at all save with the terrible old man who
   afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the
   man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up
   and that somewhere under that gray peaked roof or amidst inconceivable
   reaches of that sinister white mist there lingered still the lost
   spirit of him who was thomas olney

   and ever since that hour through dull dragging years of grayness and
   weariness the philosopher has labored and eaten and slept and done
   uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen not any more does he
   long for the magic of farther hills or sigh for secrets that peer like
   green reefs from a bottomless sea the sameness of his days no longer
   gives him sorrow and welldisciplined thoughts have grown enough for
   his imagination his good wife waxes stouter and his children older and
   prosier and more useful and he never fails to smile correctly with
   pride when the occasion calls for it in his glance there is not any
   restless light and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin
   horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering he has never
   seen kingsport again for his family disliked the funny old houses and
   complained that the drains were impossibly bad they have a trim
   bungalow now at bristol highlands where no tall crags tower and the
   neighbors are urban and modern

   but in kingsport strange tales are abroad and even the terrible old
   man admits a thing untold by his grandfather for now when the wind
   sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is
   one with the firmament there is broken at last that ominous brooding
   silence ever before the bane of kingsports maritime cotters and old
   folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there and of laughter that
   swells with joys beyond earths joys; and say that at evening the
   little low windows are brighter than formerly they say too that the
   fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot shining blue in the north
   with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black
   and fantastic against wild coruscations and the mists of the dawn are
   thicker and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward
   ringing is that of the solemn buoys

   worst of all though is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of
   kingsports young men who grow prone to listen at night to the north
   winds faint distant sounds they swear no harm or pain can inhabit
   that high peaked cottage for in the new voices gladness beats and
   with them the tinkle of laughter and music what tales the seamists
   may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know
   but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the
   cliffyawning door when clouds are thickest and patriarchs dread lest
   some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky
   and learn what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof
   which is part of the rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of
   kingsport that those venturesome youths will come back they do not
   doubt but they think a light may be gone from their eyes and a will
   from their hearts and they do not wish quaint kingsport with its
   climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the years while
   voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that
   unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to
   rest on their way from the sea to the skies

   they do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant
   hearths and gambrelroofed taverns of old kingsport nor do they wish
   the laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder for as
   the voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea and from
   the north fresh lights so do they say that still other voices will
   bring more mists and more lights till perhaps the olden gods (whose
   existence they hint only in whispers for fear the congregational parson
   shall hear) may come out of the deep and from unknown kadath in the
   cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so
   close to the gentle hills and valleys of quiet simple fisher folk
   this they do not wish for to plain people things not of earth are
   unwelcome; and besides the terrible old man often recalls what olney
   said about a knock that the lone dweller feared and a shape seen black
   and inquisitive against the mist through those queer translucent
   windows of leaded bullseyes

   all these things however the elder ones only may decide; and
   meanwhile the morning mist still comes up by that lovely vertiginous
   peak with the steep ancient house that gray loweaved house where
   none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north
   wind tells of strange revels white and feathery it comes from the deep
   to its brothers the clouds full of dreams of dank pastures and caves
   of leviathan and when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons and
   conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones
   then great eager vapors flock to heaven laden with lore; and kingsport
   nestling uneasy in its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging
   sentinel of rock sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness as if the
   cliffs rim were the rim of all earth and the solemn bells of the
   buoys tolled free in the aether of faery

   there be those who say that things and places have souls and there be
   those who say they have not; i dare not say myself but i will tell of
   the street

   men of strength and honour fashioned that street: good valiant men of
   our blood who had come from the blessed isles across the sea at first
   it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring
   to the cluster of houses by the beach then as more men came to the
   growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell they
   built cabins along the north side cabins of stout oaken logs with
   masonry on the side toward the forest for many indians lurked there
   with firearrows and in a few years more men built cabins on the
   south side of the street

   up and down the street walked grave men in conical hats who most of
   the time carried muskets or fowling pieces and there were also their
   bonneted wives and sober children in the evening these men with their
   wives and children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak
   very simple were the things of which they read and spoke yet things
   which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue
   the forest and till the fields and the children would listen and learn
   of the laws and deeds of old and of that dear england which they had
   never seen or could not remember

   there was war and thereafter no more indians troubled the street the
   men busy with labour waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how
   to be and the children grew up comfortable and more families came
   from the mother land to dwell on the street and the childrens
   children and the newcomers children grew up the town was now a
   city and one by one the cabins gave place to housessimple beautiful
   houses of brick and wood with stone steps and iron railings and
   fanlights over the doors no flimsy creations were these houses for
   they were made to serve many a generation within there were carven
   mantels and graceful stairs and sensible pleasing furniture china
   and silver brought from the mother land

   so the street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its
   dwellers became more graceful and happy where once had been only
   strength and honour taste and learning now abode as well books and
   paintings and music came to the houses and the young men went to the
   university which rose above the plain to the north in the place of
   conical hats and smallswords of lace and snowy periwigs there were
   cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many
   a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and
   hitchingposts

   there were in that street many trees: elms and oaks and maples of
   dignity; so that in the summer the scene was all soft verdure and
   twittering birdsong and behind the houses were walled rosegardens
   with hedged paths and sundials where at evening the moon and stars
   would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew

   so the street dreamed on past wars calamities and change once most
   of the young men went away and some never came back that was when
   they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars
   but though men talked of great changes the street felt them not for
   its folk were still the same speaking of the old familiar things in
   the old familiar accounts and the trees still sheltered singing birds
   and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the
   walled rosegardens

   in time there were no more swords threecornered hats or periwigs in
   the street how strange seemed the inhabitants with their
   walkingsticks tall beavers and cropped heads! new sounds came from
   the distancefirst strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile
   away and then many years later strange puffings and shrieks and
   rumblings from other directions the air was not quite so pure as
   before but the spirit of the place had not changed the blood and soul
   of their ancestors had fashioned the street nor did the spirit change
   when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes or when they
   set up tall posts bearing weird wires there was so much ancient lore
   in that street that the past could not easily be forgotten

   then came days of evil when many who had known the street of old knew
   it no more and many knew it who had not known it before and went
   away for their accents were coarse and strident and their mien and
   faces unpleasing their thoughts too fought with the wise just
   spirit of the street so that the street pined silently as its houses
   fell into decay and its trees died one by one and its rosegardens
   grew rank with weeds and waste but it felt a stir of pride one day
   when again marched forth young men some of whom never came back these
   young men were clad in blue

   with the years worse fortune came to the street its trees were all
   gone now and its rosegardens were displaced by the backs of cheap
   ugly new buildings on parallel streets yet the houses remained
   despite the ravages of the years and the storms and worms for they had
   been made to serve many a generation new kinds of faces appeared in
   the street swarthy sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features
   whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and
   unknown characters upon most of the musty houses pushcarts crowded
   the gutters a sordid undefinable stench settled over the place and
   the ancient spirit slept

   great excitement once came to the street war and revolution were
   raging across the seas; a dynasty had collapsed and its degenerate
   subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the western land many of
   these took lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the
   songs of birds and the scent of roses then the western land itself
   awoke and joined the mother land in her titanic struggle for
   civilization over the cities once more floated the old flag
   companioned by the new flag and by a plainer yet glorious tricolour
   but not many flags floated over the street for therein brooded only
   fear and hatred and ignorance again young men went forth but not
   quite as did the young men of those other days something was lacking
   and the sons of those young men of other days who did indeed go forth
   in olivedrab with the true spirit of their ancestors went from
   distant places and knew not the street and its ancient spirit

   over the seas there was a great victory and in triumph most of the
   young men returned those who had lacked something lacked it no longer
   yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street; for
   many had stayed behind and many strangers had come from distance
   places to the ancient houses and the young men who had returned dwelt
   there no longer swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers yet
   among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned the
   street and moulded its spirit like and yet unlike for there was in
   the eyes of all a weird unhealthy glitter as of greed ambition
   vindictiveness or misguided zeal unrest and treason were abroad
   amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the western land its death
   blow that they might mount to power over its ruins even as assassins
   had mounted in that unhappy frozen land from whence most of them had
   come and the heart of that plotting was in the street whose crumbling
   houses teemed with alien makers of discord and echoed with the plans
   and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed day of blood flame
   and crime

   of the various odd assemblages in the street the law said much but
   could prove little with great diligence did men of hidden badges
   linger and listen about such places as petrovitchs bakery the squalid
   rifkin school of modern economics the circle social club and the
   liberty cafe there congregated sinister men in great numbers yet
   always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue and still the
   old houses stood with their forgotten lore of nobler departed
   centuries; of sturdy colonial tenants and dewy rosegardens in the
   moonlight sometimes a lone poet or traveler would come to view them
   and would try to picture them in their vanished glory; yet of such
   travelers and poets there were not many

   the rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of
   a vast band of terrorists who on a designated day were to launch an
   orgy of slaughter for the extermination of america and of all the fine
   old traditions which the street had loved handbills and papers
   fluttered about filthy gutters; handbills and papers printed in many
   tongues and in many characters yet all bearing messages of crime and
   rebellion in these writings the people were urged to tear down the
   laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted to stamp out the soul of
   the old americathe soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a
   half years of anglosaxon freedom justice and moderation it was said
   that the swart men who dwelt in the street and congregated in its
   rotting edifices were the brains of a hideous revolution that at their
   word of command many millions of brainless besotted beasts would
   stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities
   burning slaying and destroying till the land of our fathers should be
   no more all this was said and repeated and many looked forward in
   dread to the fourth day of july about which the strange writings
   hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt none could
   tell just whose arrest might cut off the damnable plotting at its
   source many times came bands of bluecoated police to search the shaky
   houses though at last they ceased to come; for they too had grown
   tired of law and order and had abandoned all the city to its fate
   then men in olivedrab came bearing muskets till it seemed as if in
   its sad sleep the street must have some haunting dreams of those other
   days when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from the
   woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach yet could no act
   be performed to check the impending cataclysm for the swart sinister
   men were old in cunning

   so the street slept uneasily on till one night there gathered in
   petrovitchs bakery and the rifkin school of modern economics and the
   circle social club and liberty cafe and in other places as well vast
   hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and
   expectation over hidden wires strange messages traveled and much was
   said of still stranger messages yet to travel; but most of this was not
   guessed till afterward when the western land was safe from the peril
   the men in olivedrab could not tell what was happening or what they
   ought to do; for the swart sinister men were skilled in subtlety and
   concealment

   and yet the men in olivedrab will always remember that night and will
   speak of the street as they tell of it to their grandchildren; for many
   of them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which
   they had expected it was known that this nest of anarchy was old and
   that the houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the
   storms and worms; yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise
   because of its very queer uniformity it was indeed an exceedingly
   singular happening though after all a simple one for without
   warning in one of the small hours beyond midnight all the ravages of
   the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and
   after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two
   ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall nor did anything that
   had been alive come alive from the ruins a poet and a traveler who
   came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene tell odd stories the
   poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins
   indistinctly in the glare of the arclights; that there loomed above
   the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe moonlight and
   fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity and the traveler
   declares that instead of the places wonted stench there lingered a
   delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom but are not the dreams of
   poets and the tales of travelers notoriously false?

   there be those who say that things and places have souls and there be
   those who say they have not; i dare not say myself but i have told
   you of the street

   manuscript found on the coast of yucatan

   on august 20 1917 i karl heinrich graf von altbergehrenstein
   lieutenantcommander in the imperial german navy and in charge of the
   submarine u29 deposit this bottle and record in the atlantic ocean at
   a point to me unknown but probably about n latitude 20 degrees w
   longitude 35 degrees where my ship lies disabled on the ocean floor i
   do so because of my desire to set certain unusual facts before the
   public; a thing i shall not in all probability survive to accomplish in
   person since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing as they
   are extraordinary and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the
   u29 but the impairment of my iron german will in a manner most
   disastrous

   on the afternoon of june 18 as reported by wireless to the u61 bound
   for kiel we torpedoed the british freighter victory new york to
   liverpool in n latitude 45 degrees 16 minutes w longitude 28
   degrees 34 minutes; permitting the crew to leave in boats in order to
   obtain a good cinema view for the admiralty records the ship sank
   quite picturesquely bow first the stem rising high out of the water
   whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea our
   camera missed nothing and i regret that so fine a reel of film should
   never reach berlin after that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and
   submerged

   when we rose to the surface about sunset a seamans body was found on
   the deck hands gripping the railing in curious fashion the poor
   fellow was young rather dark and very handsome; probably an italian
   or greek and undoubtedly of the victorys crew he had evidently
   sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own
    one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the english
   pigdogs are waging upon the fatherland our men searched him for
   souvenirs and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved
   to represent a youths head crowned with laurel my fellowofficer
   lieutenant kienze believed that the thing was of great age and
   artistic value so took it from the men for himself how it had ever
   come into the possession of a common sailor neither he nor i could
   imagine

   as the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which
   created much disturbance amongst the crew the fellows eyes had been
   closed; but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred
   open and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed
   steadily and mockingly at schmidt and zimmer who were bent over the
   corpse the boatswain muller an elderly man who would have known
   better had he not been a superstitious alsatian swine became so
   excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water; and
   swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming
   position and sped away to the south under the waves kienze and i did
   not like these displays of peasant ignorance and severely reprimanded
   the men particularly muller

   the next day a very troublesome situation was created by the
   indisposition of some of the crew they were evidently suffering from
   the nervous strain of our long voyage and had had bad dreams several
   seemed quite dazed and stupid; and after satisfying myself that they
   were not feigning their weakness i excused them from their duties the
   sea was rather rough so we descended to a depth where the waves were
   less troublesome here we were comparatively calm despite a somewhat
   puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our
   oceanographic charts the moans of the sick men were decidedly
   annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralize the rest of the
   crew we did not resort to extreme measures it was our plan to remain
   where we were and intercept the liner dacia mentioned in information
   from agents in new york

   in the early evening we rose to the surface and found the sea less
   heavy the smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon but our
   distance and ability to submerge made us safe what worried us more was
   the talk of boatswain muller which grew wilder as night came on he
   was in a detestably childish state and babbled of some illusion of
   dead bodies drifting past the undersea portholes; bodies which looked
   at him intensely and which he recognized in spite of bloating as
   having seen dying during some of our victorious german exploits and he
   said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard was their
   leader this was very gruesome and abnormal so we confined muller in
   irons and had him soundly whipped the men were not pleased at his
   punishment but discipline was necessary we also denied the request of
   a delegation headed by seaman zimmer that the curious carved ivory
   head be cast into the sea

   on june 20 seaman bohin and schmidt who had been ill the day before
   became violently insane i regretted that no physician was included in
   our complement of officers since german lives are precious; but the
   constant ravings of the two concerning a terrible curse were most
   subversive of discipline so drastic steps were taken the crew
   accepted the event in a sullen fashion but it seemed to quiet muller;
   who thereafter gave us no trouble in the evening we released him and
   he went about his duties silently

   in the week that followed we were all very nervous watching for the
   dacia the tension was aggravated by the disappearance of muller and
   zimmer who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears
   which had seemed to harass them though they were not observed in the
   act of jumping overboard i was rather glad to be rid of muller for
   even his silence had unfavorably affected the crew everyone seemed
   inclined to be silent now as though holding a secret fear many were
   ill but none made a disturbance lieutenant kienze chafed under the
   strain and was annoyed by the merest trifle  such as the school of
   dolphins which gathered about the u29 in increasing numbers and the
   growing intensity of that southward current which was not on our chart

   it at length became apparent that we had missed the dacia altogether
   such failures are not uncommon and we were more pleased than
   disappointed since our return to wilhelmshaven was now in order at
   noon june 28 we turned northeastward and despite some rather comical
   entanglements with the unusual masses of dolphins were soon under way

   the explosion in the engine room at 2 am was wholly a surprise no
   defect in the machinery or carelessness in the men had been noticed
   yet without warning the ship was racked from end to end with a colossal
   shock lieutenant kienze hurried to the engine room finding the
   fueltank and most of the mechanism shattered and engineers raabe and
   schneider instantly killed our situation had suddenly become grave
   indeed; for though the chemical air regenerators were intact and
   though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship and
   opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries
   might hold out we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine to
   seek rescue in the lifeboats would be to deliver ourselves into the
   hands of enemies unreasonably embittered against our great german
   nation and our wireless had failed ever since the victory affair to
   put us in touch with a fellow uboat of the imperial navy

   from the hour of the accident till july 2 we drifted constantly to the
   south almost without plans and encountering no vessel dolphins still
   encircled the u29 a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the
   distance we had covered on the morning of july 2 we sighted a warship
   flying american colors and the men became very restless in their
   desire to surrender finally lieutenant menze had to shoot a seaman
   named traube who urged this ungerman act with especial violence this
   quieted the crew for the time and we submerged unseen

   the next afternoon a dense flock of seabirds appeared from the south
   and the ocean began to heave ominously closing our hatches we awaited
   developments until we realized that we must either submerge or be
   swamped in the mounting waves our air pressure and electricity were
   diminishing and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender
   mechanical resources; but in this case there was no choice we did not
   descend far and when after several hours the sea was calmer we
   decided to return to the surface here however a new trouble
   developed; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of
   all that the mechanics could do as the men grew more frightened at
   this undersea imprisonment some of them began to mutter again about
   lieutenant kienzes ivory image but the sight of an automatic pistol
   calmed them we kept the poor devils as busy as we could tinkering at
   the machinery even when we knew it was useless

   kienze and i usually slept at different times; and it was during my
   sleep about 5 am july 4 that the general mutiny broke loose the
   six remaining pigs of seamen suspecting that we were lost had
   suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the
   yankee battleship two days before and were in a delirium of cursing
   and destruction they roared like the animals they were and broke
   instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such
   nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who
   looked at them and swam away lieutenant kienze seemed paralyzed and
   inefficient as one might expect of a soft womanish rhinelander i
   shot all six men for it was necessary and made sure that none
   remained alive

   we expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the
   u29 kienze seemed very nervous and drank heavily it was decided
   that we remain alive as long as possible using the large stock of
   provisions and chemical supply of oxygen none of which had suffered
   from the crazy antics of those swinehound seamen our compasses depth
   gauges and other delicate instruments were ruined; so that henceforth
   our only reckoning would be guess work based on our watches the
   calendar and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we might spy
   through the portholes or from the conning tower fortunately we had
   storage batteries still capable of long use both for interior lighting
   and for the searchlight we often cast a beam around the ship but saw
   only dolphins swimming parallel to our own drifting course i was
   scientifically interested in those dolphins; for though the ordinary
   delphinus delphis is a cetacean mammal unable to subsist without air
   i watched one of the swimmers closely for two hours and did not see
   him alter his submerged condition

   with the passage of time kienze and i decided that we were still
   drifting south meanwhile sinking deeper and deeper we noted the
   marine fauna and flora and read much on the subject in the books i had
   carried withme for spare moments i could not help observing however
   the inferior scientific knowledge of my companion his mind was not
   prussian but given to imaginings and speculations which have no value
   the fact of our coming death affected him curiously and he would
   frequently pray in remorse over the men women and children we had
   sent to the bottom; forgetting that all things are noble which serve
   the german state after a time he became noticeably unbalanced gazing
   for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost
   and forgotten things under the sea sometimes as a psychological
   experiment i would lead him on in the wanderings and listen to his
   endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships i was very sorry
   for him for i dislike to see a german suffer; but he was not a good
   man to die with for myself i was proud knowing how the fatherland
   would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be men like
   me

   on august 9 we espied the ocean floor and sent a powerful beam from
   the searchlight over it it was a vast undulating plain mostly covered
   with seaweed and strewn with the shells of small mollusks here and
   there were slimy objects of puzzling contour draped with weeds and
   encrusted with barnacles which kienze declared must be ancient ships
   lying in their graves he was puzzled by one thing a peak of solid
   matter protruding above the oceanbed nearly four feet at its apex;
   about two feet thick with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which
   met at a very obtuse angle i called the peak a bit of outcropping
   rock but kienze thought he saw carvings on it after a while he began
   to shudder and turned away from the scene as if frightened; yet could
   give no explanation save that he was overcome with the vastness
   darkness remoteness antiquity and mystery of the oceanic abysses
   his mind was tired but i am always a german and was quick to notice
   two things: that the u29 was standing the deepsea pressure
   splendidly and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us even at
   a depth where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible
   by most naturalists that i had previously overestimated our depth i
   was sure; but none the less we must still have been deep enough to make
   these phenomena remarkable our southward speed as gauged by the ocean
   floor was about as i had estimated from the organisms passed at higher
   levels

   it was at 3:15 pm august 12 that poor kienze went wholly mad he had
   been in the conning tower using the searchlight when i saw him bound
   into the library compartment where i sat reading and his face at once
   betrayed him i will repeat here what he said underlining the words he
   emphasized: he is calling! he is calling! i hear him! we must go! as
   he spoke he took his ivory image from the table pocketed it and
   seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck
   in a moment i understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge
   with me into the water outside a vagary of suicidal and homicidal
   mania for which i was scarcely prepared as i hung back and attempted
   to soothe him he grew more violent saying: come now  do not wait
   until later; it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be
   condemned then i tried the opposite of the soothing plan and told
   him he was mad  pitifully demented but he was unmoved and cried: if
   i am mad it is mercy may the gods pity the man who in his callousness
   can remam sane to the hideous end! come and be mad whilst he still
   calls with mercy!

   this outburst seemed to relieve a pressure in his brain; for as he
   finished he grew much milder asking me to let him depart alone if i
   would not accompany him my course at once became clear he was a
   german but only a rhinelander and a commoner; and he was now a
   potentially dangerous madman by complying with his suicidal request i
   could immediately free myself from one who was no longer a companion
   but a menace i asked him to give me the ivory image before he went
   but this request brought from him such uncanny laughter that i did not
   repeat it then i asked him if he wished to leave any keepsake or lock
   of hair for his family in germany in case i should be rescued but
   again he gave me that strange laugh so as he climbed the ladder i went
   to the levers and allowing proper timeintervals operated the
   machinery which sent him to his death after i saw that he was no
   longer in the boat i threw the searchlight around the water in an
   effort to obtain a last glimpse of him since i wished to ascertain
   whether the waterpressure would flatten him as it theoretically
   should or whether the body would be unaffected like those
   extraordinary dolphins i did not however succeed in finding my late
   companion for the dolphins were massed thickly and obscuringly about
   the conning tower

   that evening i regretted that i had not taken the ivory image
   surreptitiously from poor kienzes pocket as he left for the memory of
   it fascinated me i could not forget the youthful beautiful head with
   its leafy crown though i am not by nature an artist i was also sorry
   that i had no one with whom to converse kienze though not my mental
   equal was much better than no one i did not sleep well that night
   and wondered exactly when the end would come surely i had little
   enough chance of rescue

   the next day i ascended to the conning tower and commenced the
   customary searchlight explorations northward the view was much the
   same as it had been all the four days since we had sighted the bottom
   but i perceived that the drifting of the u29 was less rapid as i
   swung the beam around to the south i noticed that the ocean floor
   ahead fell away in a marked declivity and bore curiously regular
   blocks of stone in certain places disposed as if in accordance with
   definite patterns the boat did not at once descend to match the
   greater ocean depth so i was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to
   cast a sharply downward beam owing to the abruptness of the change a
   wire was disconnected which necessitated a delay of many minutes for
   repairs; but at length the light streamed on again flooding the marine
   valley below me

   i am not given to emotion of any kind but my amazement was very great
   when i saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow and yet as one
   reared in the best kultur of prussia i should not have been amazed
   for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in
   oceanic and continental areas what i saw was an extended and elaborate
   array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified
   architecture and in various stages of preservation most appeared to
   be of marble gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight and the
   general plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley with
   numerous isolated temples and villas on the steep slopes above roofs
   were fallen and columns were broken but there still remained an air of
   immemorially ancient splendor which nothing could efface

   confronted at last with the atlantis i had formerly deemed largely a
   myth i was the most eager of explorers at the bottom of that valley a
   river once had flowed; for as i examined the scene more closely i
   beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and seawalls and
   terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful in my enthusiasm i
   became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor kienze and was very
   tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last
   allowing the u29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an
   airplane settles upon a town of the upper earth i was slow too in
   realizing that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished

   in about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky
   wall of the valley on one side i could view the entire city as it
   sloped from the plaza down to the old riverbank; on the other side in
   startling proximity i was confronted by the richly ornate and
   perfectly preserved facade of a great building evidently a temple
   hollowed from the solid rock of the original workmanship of this
   titanic thing i can only make conjectures the facade of immense
   magnitude apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its
   windows are many and widely distributed in the center yawns a great
   open door reached by an impressive flight of steps and surrounded by
   exquisite carvings like the figures of bacchanals in relief foremost
   of all are the great columns and frieze both decorated with sculptures
   of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealized pastoral scenes
   and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial
   devices in adoration of a radiant god the art is of the most
   phenomenal perfection largely hellenic in idea yet strangely
   individual it imparts an impression of terrible antiquity as though
   it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of greek art
   nor can i doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned
   from the virgin hillside rock of our planet it is palpably a part of
   the valley wall though how the vast interior was ever excavated i
   cannot imagine perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the
   nucleus neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur
   of this awful fane  for fane indeed it must be  and today after
   thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless
   night and silence of an oceanchasm

   i cannot reckon the number of hours i spent in gazing at the sunken
   city with its buildings arches statues and bridges and the colossal
   temple with its beauty and mystery though i knew that death was near
   my curiosity was consuming; and i threw the searchlight beam about in
   eager quest the shaft of light permitted me to learn many details but
   refused to show anything within the gaping door of the rockhewn
   temple; and after a time i turned off the current conscious of the
   need of conserving power the rays were now perceptibly dimmer than
   they had been during the weeks of drifting and as if sharpened by the
   coming deprivation of light my desire to explore the watery secrets
   grew i a german should be the first to tread those eonforgotten
   ways!

   i produced and examined a deepsea diving suit of jointed metal and
   experimented with the portable light and air regenerator though i
   should have trouble in managing the double hatches alone i believed i
   could overcome all obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk
   about the dead city in person

   on august 16 i effected an exit from the u29 and laboriously made my
   way through the ruined and mudchoked streets to the ancient river i
   found no skeletons or other human remains but gleaned a wealth of
   archeological lore from sculptures and coins of this i cannot now
   speak save to utter my awe at a culture in the full noon of glory when
   cavedwellers roamed europe and the nile flowed unwatched to the sea
   others guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found must
   unfold the mysteries at which i can only hint i returned to the boat
   as my electric batteries grew feeble resolved to explore the rock
   temple on the following day

   on the 17th as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple
   waxed still more insistent a great disappointment befell me; for i
   found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had
   perished in the mutiny of those pigs in july my rage was unbounded
   yet my german sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly
   black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine
   monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings i could never
   extricate myself all i could do was to turn on the waning searchlight
   of the u29 and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the
   exterior carvings the shaft of light entered the door at an upward
   angle and i peered in to see if i could glimpse anything but all in
   vain not even the roof was visible; and though i took a step or two
   inside after testing the floor with a staff i dared not go farther
   moreover for the first time in my life i experienced the emotion of
   dread i began to realize how some of poor kienzes moods had arisen
   for as the temple drew me more and more i feared its aqueous abysses
   with a blind and mounting terror returning to the submarine i turned
   off the lights and sat thinking in the dark electricity must now be
   saved for emergencies

   saturday the 18th i spent in total darkness tormented by thoughts and
   memories that threatened to overcome my german will kienze had gone
   mad and perished before reaching this sinster remnant of a past
   unwholesomely remote and had advised me to go with him was indeed
   fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more
   horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of? clearly my
   nerves were sorely taxed and i must cast off these impressions of
   weaker men

   i could not sleep saturday night and turned on the lights regardless
   of the future it was annoying that the electricity should not last out
   the air and provisions i revived my thoughts of euthanasia and
   examined my automatic pistol toward morning i must have dropped asleep
   with the lights on for i awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find
   the batteries dead i struck several matches in succession and
   desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to
   use up the few candles we carried

   after the fading of the last match i dared to waste i sat very quietly
   without a light as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over
   preceding events and developed a hitherto dormant impression which
   would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder the
   head of the radiant god in the sculptures on the rock temple is the
   same as that carven bit of ivory which the dead sailor brought from the
   sea and which poor kienze carried back into the sea

   i was a little dazed by this coincidence but did not become terrified
   it is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and
   the complex by the primitive shortcut of supernaturalism the
   coincidence was strange but i was too sound a reasoner to connect
   circumstances which admit of no logical connection or to associate in
   any uncanny fashion the disastrous events which had led from the
   victory affair to my present plight feeling the need of more rest i
   took a sedative and secured some more sleep my nervous condition was
   reflected in my dreams for i seemed to hear the cries of drowning
   persons and to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the
   boat and among the dead faces was the living mocking face of the
   youth with the ivory image

   i must be careful how i record my awakening today for i am unstrung
   and much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact psychologically
   my case is most interesting and i regret that it cannot be observed
   scientifically by a competent german authority upon opening my eyes my
   first sensation was an overmastering desire to visit the rock temple; a
   desire which grew every instant yet which i automatically sought to
   resist through some emotion of fear which operated in the reverse
   direction next there came to me the impression of light amidst the
   darkness of dead batteries and i seemed to see a sort of
   phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened
   toward the temple this aroused my curiosity for i knew of no deepsea
   organism capable of emitting such luminosity

   but before i could investigate there came a third impression which
   because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of
   anything my senses might record it was an aural delusion; a sensation
   of rhythmic melodic sound as of some wild yet beautiful chant or
   choral hymn coming from the outside through the absolutely soundproof
   hull of the u29 convinced of my psychological and nervous
   abnormallty i lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium
   bromide solution which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling
   the illusion of sound but the phosphorescence remained and i had
   difficulty in repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and
   seek its source it was horribly realistic and i could soon
   distinguish by its aid the familiar objects around me as well as the
   empty sodium bromide glass of which i had had no former visual
   impression in its present location this last circumstance made me
   ponder and i crossed the room and touched the glass it was indeed in
   the place where i had seemed to see it now i knew that the light was
   either real or part of an hallucination so fixed and consistent that i
   could not hope to dispel it so abandoning all resistance i ascended to
   the conning tower to look for the luminous agency might it not
   actually be another uboat offering possibilities of rescue?

   it is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective
   truth for since the events transcend natural law they are necessily
   the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind when i
   attained the conning tower i found the sea in general far less luminous
   than i had expected there was no animal or vegetable phosphorescence
   about and the city that sloped down to the river was invisible in
   blackness what i did see was not spectacular not grotesque or
   terrifying yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my
   consciousness for the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn
   from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance as
   from a mighty altarflame far within

   later incidents are chaotic as i stared at the uncannily lighted door
   and windows i became subject to the most extravagant visions  visions
   so extravagant that i cannot even relate them i fancied that i
   discerned objects in the temple; objects both stationary and moving;
   and seemed to hear again the unreal chant that had floated to me when
   first i awaked and over all rose thoughts and fears which centered in
   the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated
   on the frieze and columns of the temple before me i thought of poor
   kienze and wondered where his body rested with the image he had
   carried back into the sea he had warned me of something and i had not
   heeded  but he was a softheaded rhinelander who went mad at troubles
   a prussian could bear with ease

   the rest is very simple my impulse to visit and enter the temple has
   now become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately
   cannot be denied my own german will no longer controls my acts and
   volition is henceforward possible only in minor matters such madness
   it was which drove kienze to his death bareheaded and unprotected in
   the ocean; but i am a prussian and a man of sense and will use to the
   last what little will i have when first i saw that i must go i
   prepared my diving suit helmet and air regenerator for instant
   donning and immediately commenced to write this hurried chronicle in
   the hope that it may some day reach the world i shall seal the
   manuscript in a bottle and entrust it to the sea as i leave the u29
   for ever

   i have no fear not even from the prophecies of the madman kienze what
   i have seen cannot be true and i know that this madness of my own will
   at most lead only to suffocation when my air is gone the light in the
   temple is a sheer delusion and i shall die calmly like a german in
   the black and forgotten depths this demoniac laughter which i hear as
   i write comes only from my own weakening brain so i will carefully don
   my suit and walk boldly up the steps into the primal shrine that
   silent secret of unfathomed waters and uncounted years

   8528the terrible old manh p lovecraft

   it was the design of angelo ricci and joe czanek and manuel silva to
   call on the terrible old man this old man dwells all alone in a very
   ancient house on water street near the sea and is reputed to be both
   exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble; which forms a situation very
   attractive to men of the profession of messrs ricci czanek and
   silva for that profession was nothing less dignified than robbery

   the inhabitants of kingsport say and think many things about the
   terrible old man which generally keep him safe from the attention of
   gentlemen like mr ricci and his colleagues despite the almost certain
   fact that he hides a fortune of indefinite magnitude somewhere about
   his musty and venerable abode he is in truth a very strange person
   believed to have been a captain of east india clipper ships in his day;
   so old that no one can remember when he was young and so taciturn that
   few know his real name among the gnarled trees in the front yard of
   his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large
   stones oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in
   some obscure eastern temple this collection frightens away most of the
   small boys who love to taunt the terrible old man about his long white
   hair and beard or to break the smallpaned windows of his dwelling
   with wicked missiles; but there are other things which frighten the
   older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer
   in through the dusty panes these folk say that on a table in a bare
   room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles in each a small
   piece of lead suspended pendulumwise from a string and they say that
   the terrible old man talks to these bottles addressing them by such
   names as jack scarface long tom spanish joe peters and mate
   ellis and that whenever he speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum
   within makes certain definite vibrations as if in answer

   those who have watched the tall lean terrible old man in these
   peculiar conversations do not watch him again but angelo ricci and
   joe czanek and manuel silva were not of kingsport blood; they were of
   that new and heterogeneous alien stock which lies outside the charmed
   circle of new england life and traditions and they saw in the terrible
   old man merely a tottering almost helpless greybeard who could not
   walk without the aid of his knotted cane and whose thin weak hands
   shook pitifully they were really quite sorry in their way for the
   lonely unpopular old fellow whom everybody shunned and at whom all
   the dogs barked singularly but business is business and to a robber
   whose soul is in his profession there is a lure and a challenge about
   a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank and who
   pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and
   silver minted two centuries ago

   messrs ricci czanek and silva selected the night of april 11th for
   their call mr ricci and mr silva were to interview the poor old
   gentleman whilst mr czanek waited for them and their presumable
   metallic burden with a covered motorcar in ship street by the gate in
   the tall rear wall of their hosts grounds desire to avoid needless
   explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these
   plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure

   as prearranged the three adventurers started out separately in order
   to prevent any evilminded suspicions afterward messrs ricci and
   silva met in water street by the old mans front gate and although
   they did not like the way the moon shone down upon the painted stones
   through the budding branches of the gnarled trees they had more
   important things to think about than mere idle superstition they
   feared it might be unpleasant work making the terrible old man
   loquacious concerning his hoarded gold and silver for aged
   seacaptains are notably stubborn and perverse still he was very old
   and very feeble and there were two visitors messrs ricci and silva
   were experienced in the art of making unwilling persons voluble and
   the screams of a weak and exceptionally venerable man can be easily
   muffled so they moved up to the one lighted window and heard the
   terrible old man talking childishly to his bottles with pendulums then
   they donned masks and knocked politely at the weatherstained oaken
   door

   waiting seemed very long to mr czanek as he fidgeted restlessly in the
   covered motorcar by the terrible old mans back gate in ship street
   he was more than ordinarily tenderhearted and he did not like the
   hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour
   appointed for the deed had he not told his colleagues to be as gentle
   as possible with the pathetic old seacaptain? very nervously he
   watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivyclad stone wall
   frequently he consulted his watch and wondered at the delay had the
   old man died before revealing where his treasure was hidden and had a
   thorough search become necessary? mr czanek did not like to wait so
   long in the dark in such a place then he sensed a soft tread or
   tapping on the walk inside the gate heard a gentle fumbling at the
   rusty latch and saw the narrow heavy door swing inward and in the
   pallid glow of the single dim streetlamp he strained his eyes to see
   what his colleagues had brought out of that sinister house which loomed
   so close behind but when he looked he did not see what he had
   expected; for his colleagues were not there at all but only the
   terrible old man leaning quietly on his knotted cane and smiling
   hideously mr czanek had never before noticed the colour of that mans
   eyes; now he saw that they were yellow

   little things make considerable excitement in little towns which is
   the reason that kingsport people talked all that spring and summer
   about the three unidentifiable bodies horribly slashed as with many
   cutlasses and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel
   bootheels which the tide washed in and some people even spoke of
   things as trivial as the deserted motorcar found in ship street or
   certain especially inhuman cries probably of a stray animal or
   migratory bird heard in the night by wakeful citizens but in this
   idle village gossip the terrible old man took no interest at all he
   was by nature reserved and when one is aged and feeble ones reserve
   is doubly strong besides so ancient a seacaptain must have witnessed
   scores of things much more stirring in the faroff days of his
   unremembered youth

   the thing in the moonlight  (1941)
   by jack chapman miske
      sister projects sister projects: wikipedia article

   the thing in the moonlight is a short story by j chapman miske based
   on a letter from h p lovecraft to donald wandrei dated november 24
   1927 this letter describes a dream that lovecraft had the story was
   prepared for publication by miske who filled in the story surrounding
   the description of the dream in places the letter and published story
   are identical wordforword it was first published in bizarre
   magazine in january 1941 excerpted from the thing in the moonlight
   on wikipedia the free encyclopedia
   88176the thing in the moonlightjack chapman miske1941

   morgan is not a literary man; in fact he cannot speak english with any
   degree of coherency that is what makes me wonder about the words he
   wrote though others have laughed

   he was alone the evening it happened suddenly an unconquerable urge to
   write came over him and taking pen in hand he wrote the following:

   my name is howard phillips i live at 66 college street in providence
   rhode island on november 24 1927for i know not even what the year
   may be now i fell asleep and dreamed since when i have been unable
   to awaken

   my dream began in a dank reedchoked marsh that lay under a gray
   autumn sky with a rugged cliff of lichencrusted stone rising to the
   north impelled by some obscure quest i ascended a rift or cleft in
   this beetling precipice noting as i did so the black mouths of many
   fearsome burrows extending from both walls into the depths of the stony
   plateau

   at several points the passage was roofed over by the choking of the
   upper parts of the narrow fissure; these places being exceeding dark
   and forbidding the perception of such burrows as may have existed
   there in one such dark space i felt conscious of a singular accession
   of fright as if some subtle and bodiless emanation from the abyss were
   engulfing my spirit; but the blackness was too great for me to perceive
   the source of my alarm

   at length i emerged upon a tableland of mossgrown rock and scanty
   soil lit by a faint moonlight which had replaced the expiring orb of
   day casting my eyes about i beheld no living object; but was sensible
   of a very peculiar stirring far below me amongst the whispering rushes
   of the pestilential swamp i had lately quitted

   after walking for some distance i encountered the rusty tracks of a
   street railway and the wormeaten poles which still held the limp and
   sagging trolley wire following this line i soon came upon a yellow
   vestibuled car numbered 1852of a plain doubletrucked type common
   from 1900 to 1910 it was untenanted but evidently ready to start; the
   trolley being on the wire and the airbrake now and then throbbing
   beneath the floor i boarded it and looked vainly about for the light
   switchnoting as i did so the absence of the controller handle which
   thus implied the brief absence of the motorman then i sat down in one
   of the cross seats of the vehicle presently i heard a swishing in the
   sparse grass toward the left and saw the dark forms of two men looming
   up in the moonlight they had the regulation caps of a railway company
   and i could not doubt but that they were conductor and motorman then
   one of them sniffed with singular sharpness and raised his face to
   howl to the moon the other dropped on all fours to run toward the car

   i leaped up at once and raced madly out of that car and across endless
   leagues of plateau till exhaustion forced me to stopdoing this not
   because the conductor had dropped on all fours but because the face of
   the motorman was a mere white cone tapering to one
   bloodredtentacle

   i was aware that i only dreamed but the very awareness was not
   pleasant since that fearful night i have prayed only for
   awakeningit has not come!

   instead i have found myself an inhabitant of this terrible dreamworld!
   that first night gave way to dawn and i wandered aimlessly over the
   lonely swamplands when night came i still wandered hoping for
   awakening but suddenly i parted the weeds and saw before me the
   ancient railway carand to one side a conefaced thing lifted its head
   and in the streaming moonlight howled strangely!

   it has been the same each day night takes me always to that place of
   horror i have tried not moving with the coming of nightfall but i
   must walk in my slumber for always i awaken with the thing of dread
   howling before me in the pale moonlight and i turn and flee madly

   god! when will i awaken?

   that is what morgan wrote i would go to 66 college street in
   providence but i fear for what i might find there

i[edit]

   it is true that i have sent six bullets through the head of my best
   friend and yet i hope to show by this statement that i am not his
   murderer at first i shall be called a madman  madder than the man i
   shot in his cell at the arkham sanitarium later some of my readers
   will weigh each statement correlate it with the known facts and ask
   themselves how i could have believed otherwise than i did after facing
   the evidence of that horror  that thing on the doorstep

   until then i also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales i have
   acted on even now i ask myself whether i was misled  or whether i am
   not mad after all i do not know  but others have strange things to
   tell of edward and asenath derby and even the stolid police are at
   their wits ends to account for that last terrible visit they have
   tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by
   discharged servants yet they know in their hearts that the truth is
   something infinitely more terrible and incredible

   so i say that i have not murdered edward derby rather have i avenged
   him and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might
   have loosed untold terrors on all mankind there are black zones of
   shadow close to our daily paths and now and then some evil soul breaks
   a passage through when that happens the man who knows must strike
   before reckoning the consequences

   i have known edward pickman derby all his life eight years my junior
   he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was
   eight and i was sixteen he was the most phenomenal child scholar i
   have ever known and at seven was writing verse of a sombre fantastic
   almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him perhaps
   his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with
   his premature flowering an only child he had organic weaknesses which
   startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained
   to their side he was never allowed out without his nurse and seldom
   had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children all this
   doubtless fostered a strange secretive life in the boy with
   imagination as his one avenue of freedom

   at any rate his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his
   facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age about
   that time i had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast and i
   found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit what lay behind our
   joint love of shadows and marvels was no doubt the ancient
   mouldering and subtly fearsome town in which we live  witchcursed
   legendhaunted arkham whose huddled sagging gambrel roofs and
   crumbling georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the
   darkly muttering miskatonic

   as time went by i turned to architecture and gave up my design of
   illustrating a book of edwards demoniac poems yet our comradeship
   suffered no lessening young derbys odd genius developed remarkably
   and in his eighteenth year his collected nightmarelyrics made a real
   sensation when issued under the title azathoth and other horrors he
   was a close correspondent of the notorious baudelairean poet justin
   geoffrey who wrote the people of the monolith and died screaming in a
   madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister illregarded village in
   hungary

   in selfreliance and practical affairs however derby was greatly
   retarded because of his coddled existence his health had improved but
   his habits of childish dependence were fostered by overcareful
   parents so that he never travelled alone made independent decisions
   or assumed responsibilities it was early seen that he would not be
   equal to a struggle in the business or professional arena but the
   family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy as he grew to
   years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness blond
   and blueeyed he had the fresh complexion of a child; and his attempt
   to raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty his voice
   was soft and light and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile
   chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age he was
   of good height and his handsome face would have made him a notable
   gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness

   derbys parents took him abroad every summer and he was quick to seize
   on the surface aspects of european thought and expression his poelike
   talents turned more and more toward the decadent and other artistic
   sensitiveness and yearnings were halfaroused in him we had great
   discussions in those days i had been through harvard had studied in a
   boston architects office had married and had finally returned to
   arkham to practise my profession  settling in the family homestead in
   saltonstall street since my father had moved to florida for his health
   edward used to call almost every evening till i came to regard him as
   one of the household he had a characteristic way of ringing the
   doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code
   signal so that after dinner i always listened for the familiar three
   brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause less frequently i
   would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his
   constantly growing library

   derby went through miskatonic university in arkahm since his parents
   would not let him board away from them he entered at sixteen and
   completed his course in three years majoring in english and french
   literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and
   the sciences he mingled very little with the other students though
   looking enviously at the daring or bohemian set  whose
   superficially smart language and meaningless ironic pose he aped and
   whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt

   what he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of
   subterranean magical lore for which miskatonics library was and is
   famous always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness he
   now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous
   past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity he read things like
   the frightful book of eibon the unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt
   and the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred though
   he did not tell his parents he had seen them edward was twenty when my
   son and only child was born and seemed pleased when i named the
   newcomer edward derby upton after him

   by the time he was twentyfive edward derby was a prodigiously learned
   man and a fairly well known poet and fantaisiste though his lack of
   contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by
   making his products derivative and overbookish i was perhaps his
   closest friend  finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical
   topics while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not
   wish to refer to his parents he remained single  more through
   shyness inertia and parental protectiveness than through inclination
    and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory
   extent when the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him
   at home i went to plattsburg for a commission but never got overseas

   so the years wore on edwards mother died when he was thirty four and
   for months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady his
   father took him to europe however and he managed to pull out of his
   trouble without visible effects afterward he seemed to feel a sort of
   grotesque exhilaration as if of partial escape from some unseen
   bondage he began to mingle in the more advanced college set despite
   his middle age and was present at some extremely wild doings  on one
   occasion paying heavy blackmail (which he borrowed of me) to keep his
   presence at a certain affair from his fathers notice some of the
   whispered rumors about the wild miskatonic set were extremely singular
   there was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond
   credibility

ii[edit]

   edward was thirtyeight when he met asenath waite she was i judge
   about twentythree at the time; and was taking a special course in
   mediaeval metaphysics at miskatonic the daughter of a friend of mine
   had met her before  in the hall school at kingsport  and had been
   inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation she was dark
   smallish and very goodlooking except for overprotuberant eyes; but
   something in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people it
   was however largely her origin and conversation which caused average
   folk to avoid her she was one of the innsmouth waites and dark
   legends have clustered for generations about crumbling halfdeserted
   innsmouth and its people there are tales of horrible bargains about
   the year 1850 and of a strange element not quite human in the
   ancient families of the rundown fishing port  tales such as only
   oldtime yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness

   asenaths case was aggravated by the fact that she was ephraim waites
   daughter  the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went
   veiled ephraim lived in a halfdecayed mansion in washington street
   innsmouth and those who had seen the place (arkham folk avoid going to
   innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were
   always boarded and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within
   as evening drew on the old man was known to have been a prodigious
   magical student in his day and legend averred that he could raise or
   quell storms at sea according to his whim i had seen him once or twice
   in my youth as he came to arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the
   college library and had hated his wolfish saturnine face with its
   tangle of irongrey beard he had died insane  under rather queer
   circumstances  just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal
   ward of the principal) entered the hall school but she had been his
   morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times

   the friend whose daughter had gone to school with asenath waite
   repeated many curious things when the news of edwards acquaintance
   with her began to spread about asenath it seemed had posed as a kind
   of magician at school; and had really seemed able to accomplish some
   highly baffling marvels she professed to be able to raise
   thunderstorms though her seeming success was generally laid to some
   uncanny knack at prediction all animals markedly disliked her and she
   could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand there
   were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very
   singular  and very shocking  for a young girl; when she would
   frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind
   and would seem to extract an obscene zestful irony from her present
   situation

   most unusual though were the wellattested cases of her influence
   over other persons she was beyond question a genuine hypnotist by
   gazing peculiarly at a fellowstudent she would often give the latter a
   distinct feeling of exchanged personality  as if the subject were
   placed momentarily in the magicians body and able to stare half across
   the room at her real body whose eyes blazed and protruded with an
   alien expression asenath often made wild claims about the nature of
   consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame  or at
   least from the lifeprocesses of the physical frame her crowning rage
   however was that she was not a man; since she believed a male brain
   had certain unique and farreaching cosmic powers given a mans brain
   she declared she could not only equal but surpass her father in
   mastery of unknown forces

   edward met asenath at a gathering of intelligentsia held in one of
   the students rooms and could talk of nothing else when he came to see
   me the next day he had found her full of the interests and erudition
   which engrossed him most and was in addition wildly taken with her
   appearance i had never seen the young woman and recalled casual
   references only faintly but i knew who she was it seemed rather
   regrettable that derby should become so upheaved about her; but i said
   nothing to discourage him since infatuation thrives on opposition he
   was not he said mentioning her to his father

   in the next few weeks i heard of very little but asenath from young
   derby others now remarked edwards autumnal gallantry though they
   agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age or seem at all
   inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity he was only a
   trifle paunchy despite his indolence and selfindulgence and his face
   was absolutely without lines asenath on the other hand had the
   premature crows feet which come from the exercises of an intense will

   about this time edward brought the girl to call on me and i at once
   saw that his interest was by no means onesided she eyed him
   continually with an almost predatory air and i perceived that their
   intimacy was beyond untangling soon afterward i had a visit from old
   mr derby whom i had always admired and respected he had heard the
   tales of his sons new friendship and had wormed the whole truth out
   of the boy edward meant to marry asenath and had even been looking
   at houses in the suburbs knowing my usually great influence with his
   son the father wondered if i could help to break the illadvised
   affair off; but i regretfully expressed my doubts this time it was not
   a question of edwards weak will but of the womans strong will the
   perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image
   to a new and stronger image and nothing could be done about it

   the wedding was performed a month later  by a justice of the peace
   according to the brides request mr derby at my advice offered no
   opposition and he my wife my son and i attended the brief ceremony
    the other guests being wild young people from the college asenath
   had bought the old crowninshield place in the country at the end of
   high street and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to
   innsmouth whence three servants and some books and household goods
   were to be brought it was probably not so much consideration for
   edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college its
   library and its crowd of sophisticates that made asenath settle in
   arkham instead of returning permanently home

   when edward called on me after the honeymoon i thought he looked
   slightly changed asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped
   moustache but there was more than that he looked soberer and more
   thoughtful his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being
   exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness i was puzzled to decide
   whether i liked or disliked the change certainly he seemed for the
   moment more normally adult than ever before perhaps the marriage was a
   good thing  might not the change of dependence form a start toward
   actual neutralisaton leading ultimately to responsible independence?
   he came alone for asenath was very busy she had brought a vast store
   of books and apparatus from innsmouth (derby shuddered as he spoke the
   name) and was finishing the restoration of the crowninshield house and
   grounds

   her home  in that town  was a rather disgusting place but certain
   objects in it had taught him some surprising things he was progressing
   fast in esoteric lore now that he had asenaths guidance some of the
   experiments she proposed were very daring and radical  he did not feel
   at liberty to describe them  but he had confidence in her powers and
   intentions the three servants were very queer  an incredibly aged
   couple who had been with old ephraim and referred occasionally to him
   and to asenaths dead mother in a cryptic way and a swarthy young
   wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a
   perpetual odour of fish

iii[edit]

   for the next two years i saw less and less of derby a fortnight would
   sometimes slip by without the familiar threeandtwo strokes at the
   front door; and when he did call  or when as happened with increasing
   infrequency i called on him  he was very little disposed to converse
   on vital topics he had become secretive about those occult studies
   which he used to describe and discuss so minutely and preferred not to
   talk of his wife she had aged tremendously since her marriage till
   now  oddly enough  she seemed the elder of the two her face held the
   most concentratedly determined expression i had ever seen and her
   whole aspect seemed to gain a vague unplaceable repulsiveness my wife
   and son noticed it as much as i and we all ceased gradually to call on
   her  for which edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless
   moments she was unmitigatedly grateful occasionally the derbys would
   go on long trips  ostensibly to europe though edward sometimes hinted
   at obscurer destinations

   it was after the first year that people began talking about the change
   in edward derby it was very casual talk for the change was purely
   psychological; but it brought up some interesting points now and then
   it seemed edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things
   wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature for example 
   although in the old days he could not drive a car he was now seen
   occasionally to dash into or out of the old crowninshield driveway with
   asenaths powerful packard handling it like a master and meeting
   traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to
   his accustomed nature in such cases he seemed always to be just back
   from some trip or just starting on one  what sort of trip no one
   could guess although he mostly favoured the innsmouth road

   oddly the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing people said
   he looked too much like his wife or like old ephraim waite himself in
   these moments  or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they
   were so rare sometimes hours after starting out in this way he would
   return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an
   obviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove also his preponderant
   aspect on the streets during his decreasing round of social contacts
   (including i may say his calls on me) was the oldtime indecisive one
    its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past
   while asenaths face aged edward  aside from those exceptional
   occasions  actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity
   save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash
   across it it was really very puzzling meanwhile the derbys almost
   dropped out of the gay college circle  not through their own disgust
   we heard but because something about their present studies shocked
   even the most callous of the other decadents

   it was in the third year of the marriage that edward began to hint
   openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction he would let fall
   remarks about things going too far and would talk darkly about the
   need of gaining his identity at first i ignored such references but
   in time i began to question him guardedly remembering what my friends
   daughter had said about asenaths hypnotic influence over the other
   girls at school  the cases where students had thought they were in her
   body looking across the room at themselves this questioning seemed to
   make him at once alarmed and grateful and once he mumbled something
   about having a serious talk with me later about this time old mr
   derby died for which i was afterward very thankful edward was badly
   upset though by no means disorganized he had seen astonishingly
   little of his parent since his marriage for asenath had concentrated
   in herself all his vital sense of family linkage some called him
   callous in his loss  especially since those jaunty and confident moods
   in the car began to increase he now wished to move back into the old
   family mansion but asenath insisted on staying in the crowninshield
   house to which she had become well adjusted

   not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend  one of
   the few who had not dropped the derbys she had been out to the end of
   high street to call on the couple and had seen a car shoot briskly out
   of the drive with edwards oddly confident and almost sneering face
   above the wheel ringing the bell she had been told by the repulsive
   wench that asenath was also out; but had chanced to look at the house
   in leaving there at one of edwards library windows she had glimpsed
   a hastily withdrawn face  a face whose expression of pain defeat and
   wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description it was 
   incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast  asenaths;
   yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad muddled eyes of
   poor edward were gazing out from it

   edwards calls now grew a trifle more frequent and his hints
   occasionally became concrete what he said was not to be believed even
   in centuried and legendhaunted arkham; but he threw out his dark lore
   with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity
   he talked about terrible meetings in lonely places of cyclopean ruins
   in the heart of the maine woods beneath which vast staircases led down
   to abysses of nighted secrets of complex angles that led through
   invisible walls to other regions of space and time and of hideous
   exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and
   forbidden places on other worlds and in different spacetime
   continua

   he would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects
   which utterly nonplussed me  elusively coloured and bafflingly
   textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth whose insane
   curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no
   conceivable geometry these things he said came from outside; and
   his wife knew how to get them sometimes  but always in frightened and
   ambiguous whisper  he would suggest things about old ephraim waite
   whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days
   these adumbrations were never specific but seemed to revolve around
   some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really
   dead  in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense

   at times derby would halt abruptly in his revelations and i wondered
   whether asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance
   and cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism 
   some power of the kind she had displayed at school certainly she
   suspected that he told me things for as the weeks passed she tried to
   stop his visits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency
   only with difficulty could he get to see me for although he would
   pretend to be going somewhere else some invisible force would
   generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the
   time being his visits usually came when asenath was way  away in her
   own body as he once oddly put it she always found out later  the
   servants watched his goings and coming  but evidently she thought it
   inexpedient to do anything drastic

iv[edit]

   derby had been married more than three years on that august day when i
   got that telegram from maine i had not seen him for two months but
   had heard he was away on business asenath was supposed to be with
   him though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in the
   house behind the doubly curtained windows they had watched the
   purchases made by the servants and now the town marshal of chesuncook
   had wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with
   delirious ravings and screamed to me for protection it was edward 
   and he had been just able to recall his own name and address

   chesuncook is close to the wildest deepest and least explored forest
   belt in maine and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through
   fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car i found derby
   in a cell at the town farm vacillating between frenzy and apathy he
   knew me at once and began pouring out a meaningless halfincoherent
   torrent of words in my direction

   dan for gods sake! the pit of the shoggoths! down the six thousand
   steps the abomination of abominations i never would let her take
   me and then i found myself there  ia! shubniggurath!  the shape
   rose up from the altar and there were five hundred that howled  the
   hooded thing bleated kamog! kamog!  that was old ephraims secret
   name in the coven  i was there where she promised she wouldnt take
   me  a minute before i was locked in the library and then i was there
   where she had gone with my body  in the place of utter blasphemy the
   unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate
    i saw a shoggoth  it changed shape  i cant stand it  ill kill
   her if she ever sends me there again  ill kill that entity  her
   him it  ill kill it! ill kill it with my own hands!

   it took me an hour to quiet him but he subsided at last the next day
   i got him decent clothes in the village and set out with him for
   arkham his fury of hysteria was spent and he was inclined to be
   silent though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed
   through augusta  as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant
   memories it was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering
   the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife  delusions
   undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had
   been subjected  i thought it would be better if he did not i would i
   resolved put him up myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness
   it would make with asenath later i would help him get a divorce for
   most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage
   suicidal for him when we struck open country again derbys muttering
   faded away and i let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as i
   drove

   during our sunset dash through portland the muttering commenced again
   more distinctly than before and as i listened i caught a stream of
   utterly insane drivel about asenath the extent to which she had preyed
   on edwards nerves was plain for he had woven a whole set of
   hallucinations around her his present predicament he mumbled
   furtively was only one of a long series she was getting hold of him
   and he knew that some day she would never let go even now she probably
   let him go only when she had to because she couldnt hold on long at a
   time she constantly took his body and went to nameless places for
   nameless rites leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs  but
   sometimes she couldnt hold on and he would find himself suddenly in
   his own body again in some faroff horrible and perhaps unknown
   place sometimes shed get hold of him again and sometimes she
   couldnt often he was left stranded somewhere as i had found him 
   time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances
   getting somebody to drive the car after he found it

   the worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at
   a time she wanted to be a man  to be fully human  that was why she
   got hold of him she had sensed the mixture of finewrought brain and
   weak will in him some day she would crowd him out and disappear with
   his body  disappear to become a great magician like her father and
   leave him marooned in that female shell that wasnt even quite human
   yes he knew about the innsmouth blood now there had been traffick
   with things from the sea  it was horrible and old ephraim  he had
   known the secret and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep
   alive  he wanted to live forever  asenath would succeed  one
   successful demonstration had taken place already

   as derby muttered on i turned to look at him closely verifying the
   impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me
   paradoxically he seemed in better shape than usual  harder more
   normally developed and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused
   by his indolent habits it was as if he had been really active and
   properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life and i judged
   that asenaths force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of
   motion and alertness but just now his mind was in a pitiable state;
   for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife about black
   magic about old ephraim and about some revelation which would
   convince even me he repeated names which i recognized from bygone
   browsings in forbidden volumes and at times made me shudder with a
   certain thread of mythological consistency  or convincing coherence 
   which ran through his maundering again and again he would pause as if
   to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure

   dan dan dont you remember him  wild eyes and the unkempt beard
   that never turned white? he glared at me once and i never forgot it
   now she glares that way and i know why! he found it in the
   necronomicon  the formula i dont dare tell you the page yet but
   when i do you can read and understand then you will know what has
   engulfed me on on on on  body to body to body  he means never to
   die the lifeglow  he knows how to break the link it can flicker
   on a while even when the body is dead ill give you hints and maybe
   youll guess listen dan  do you know why my wife always takes such
   pains with that silly backhand writing? have you ever seen a manuscript
   of old ephraims? do you want to know why i shivered when i saw some
   hasty notes asenath had jotted down?

   asenath  is there such a person? why did they halfthink there was
   poison in old ephraims stomach? why do the gilmans whisper about the
   way he shrieked  like a frightened child  when he went mad and
   asenath locked him up in the padded attic room where  the other  had
   been? was it old ephraims soul that was locked in? who locked in whom?
   why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a
   weak will?  why did he curse that his daughter wasnt a son? tell me
   daniel upton  what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of
   horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting weakwilled
   halfhuman child at his mercy? didnt he make it permanent  as shell
   do in the end with me? tell me why that thing that calls itself asenath
   writes differently off guard so that you cant tell its script from 
   

   then the thing happened derbys voice was rising to a thin treble
   scream as he raved when suddenly it was shut off with an almost
   mechanical click i thought of those other occasions at my home when
   his confidences had abruptly ceased  when i had halffancied that some
   obscure telepathic wave of asenaths mental force was intervening to
   keep him silent this though was something altogether different 
   and i felt infinitely more horrible the face beside me was twisted
   almost unrecognizably for a moment while through the whole body there
   passed a shivering motion  as if all the bones organs muscles
   nerves and glands were adjusting themselves to a radically different
   posture set of stresses and general personality

   just where the supreme horror lay i could not for my life tell; yet
   there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsion 
   such a freezing petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormality 
   that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain the figure beside
   me seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous
   intrusion from outer space  some damnable utterly accursed focus of
   unknown and malign cosmic forces

   i had faltered only a moment but before another moment was over my
   companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him
   the dusk was now very thick and the lights of portland far behind so
   i could not see much of his face the blaze of his eyes though was
   phenomenal; and i knew that he must now be in that queerly energized
   state  so unlike his usual self  which so many people had noticed it
   seemed odd and incredible that listless edward derby  he who could
   never assert himself and who had never learned to drive  should be
   ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car yet that was
   precisely what had happened he did not speak for some time and in my
   inexplicable horror i was glad he did not

   in the lights of biddeford and saco i saw his firmly set mouth and
   shivered at the blaze of his eyes the people were right  he did look
   damnably like his wife and like old ephraim when in these moods i did
   not wonder that the moods were disliked  there was certainly something
   unnatural in them and i felt the sinister element all the more because
   of the wild ravings i had been hearing this man for all my lifelong
   knowledge of edward pickman derby was a stranger  an intrusion of
   some sort from the black abyss

   he did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road and when he
   did his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar it was deeper firmer and
   more decisive than i had ever known it to be; while its accent and
   pronunciation were altogether changed  though vaguely remotely and
   rather disturbingly recalling something i could not quite place there
   was i thought a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the
   timbre  not the flashy meaninglessly jaunty pseudoirony of the
   callow sophisticate which derby had habitually affected but
   something grim basic pervasive and potentially evil i marvelled at
   the selfpossession so soon following the spell of panicstruck
   muttering

   i hope youll forget my attack back there upton he was saying you
   know what my nerves are and i guess you can excuse such things im
   enormously grateful of course for this lift home

   and you must forget too any crazy things i may have been saying
   about my wife  and about things in general thats what comes from
   overstudy in a field like mine my philosophy is full of bizarre
   concepts and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of
   imaginary concrete applications i shall take a rest from now on  you
   probably wont see me for some time and you neednt blame asenath for
   it

   this trip was a bit queer but its really very simple there are
   certain indian relics in the north wood  standing stones and all that
    which mean a good deal in folklore and asenath and i are following
   that stuff up it was a hard search so i seem to have gone off my
   head i must send somebody for the car when i get home a months
   relaxation will put me on my feet

   i do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was for the
   baffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness with
   every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased till at
   length i was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive
   derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel and i was glad of the
   speed with which portsmouth and newburyport flashed by

   at the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids
   innsmouth i was halfafraid my driver would take the bleak shore road
   that goes through that damnable place he did not however but darted
   rapidly past rowley and ipswich toward our destination we reached
   arkham before midnight and found the lights still on at the old
   crowninshield house derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his
   thanks and i drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief it had
   been a terrible drive  all the more terrible because i could not quite
   tell why  and i did not regret derbys forecast of a long absence from
   my company

   the next two months were full of rumours people spoke of seeing derby
   more and more in his new energized state and asenath was scarcely ever
   in to her callers i had only one visit from edward when he called
   briefly in asenaths car  duly reclaimed from wherever he had left it
   in maine  to get some books he had lent me he was in his new state
   and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks it was
   plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this condition 
   and i noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old
   threeandtwo signal when ringing the doorbell as on that evening in
   the car i felt a faint infinitely deep horror which i could not
   explain; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief

   in midseptember derby was away for a week and some of the decadent
   college set talked knowingly of the matter  hinting at a meeting with
   a notorious cultleader lately expelled from england who had
   established headquarters in new york for my part i could not get that
   strange ride from maine out of my head the transformation i had
   witnessed had affected me profoundly and i caught myself again and
   again trying to account for the thing  and for the extreme horror it
   had inspired in me

   but the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old
   crowninshield house the voice seemed to be a womans and some of the
   younger people thought it sounded like asenaths it was heard only at
   rare intervals and would sometimes be choked off as if by force there
   was talk of an investigation but this was dispelled one day when
   asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a
   large number of acquaintances  apologizing for her recent absence and
   speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a
   guest from boston the guest was never seen but asenaths appearance
   left nothing to be said and then someone complicated matters by
   whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a mans voice

   one evening in midoctober i heard the familiar threeandtwo ring at
   the front door answering it myself i found edward on the steps and
   saw in a moment that his personality was the old one which i had not
   encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from
   chesuncook his face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in
   which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion and he looked
   furtively over his shoulder as i closed the door behind him

   following me clumsily to the study he asked for some whiskey to steady
   his nerves i forbore to question him but waited till he felt like
   beginning whatever he wanted to say at length he ventured some
   information in a choking voice

   asenath has gone dan we had a long talk last night while the
   servants were out and i made her promise to stop preying on me of
   course i had certain  certain occult defences i never told you about
   she had to give in but got frightfully angry just packed up and
   started for new york  walked right out to catch the eighttwenty in to
   boston i suppose people will talk but i cant help that you neednt
   mention that there was any trouble  just say shes gone on a long
   research trip

   shes probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of
   devotees i hope shell go west and get a divorce  anyhow ive made
   her promise to keep away and let me alone it was horrible dan  she
   was stealing my body  crowding me out  making a prisoner of me i lay
   low and pretended to let her do it but i had to be on the watch i
   could plan if i was careful for she cant read my mind literally or
   in detail all she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood
   of rebellion  and she always thought i was helpless never thought i
   could get the best of her but i had a spell or two that worked

   derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey

   i paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back they
   were ugly about it and asked questions but they went theyre her kin
    innsmouth people  and were hand and glove with her i hope theyll
   let me alone  i didnt like the way they laughed when they walked
   away i must get as many of dads old servants again as i can ill
   move back home now

   i suppose you think im crazy dan  but arkham history ought to hint
   at things that back up what ive told you  and what im going to tell
   you youve seen one of the changes too  in your car after i told you
   about asenath that day coming home from maine that was when she got me
    drove me out of my body the last thing i remember was when i was all
   worked up trying to tell you what that shedevil is then she got me
   and in a flash i was back at the house  in the library where those
   damned servants had me locked up  and in that cursed fiends body that
   isnt even human you know it was she you must have ridden home with
    that preying wolf in my body  you ought to have known the
   difference!

   i shuddered as derby paused surely i had known the difference  yet
   could i accept an explanation as insane as this? but my distracted
   caller was growing even wilder

   i had to save myself  i had to dan! shed have got me for good at
   hallowmass  they hold a sabbat up there beyond chesuncook and the
   sacrifice would have clinched things shed have got me for good 
   shed have been i and id have been she  forever  too late  my
   bodyd have been hers for good  shed have been a man and fully
   human just as she wanted to be  i suppose shed have put me out of
   the way  killed her own exbody with me in it damn her just as she
   did before  just as she did or it did before   edwards face was
   now atrociously distorted and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine
   as his voice fell to a whisper

   you must know what i hinted in the car  that she isnt asenath at
   all but really old ephraim himself i suspected it a year and a half
   ago and i know it now her handwriting shows it when she goes off
   guard  sometimes she jots down a note in writing thats just like her
   fathers manuscripts stroke for stroke  and sometimes she says things
   that nobody but an old man like ephraim could say he changed forms
   with her when he felt death coming  she was the only one he could find
   with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will  he got her body
   permanently just as she almost got mine and then poisoned the old
   body hed put her into havent you seen old ephraims soul glaring out
   of that shedevils eyes dozens of times  and out of mine when she has
   control of my body?

   the whisperer was panting and paused for breath i said nothing; and
   when he resumed his voice was nearer normal this i reflected was a
   case for the asylum but i would not be the one to send him there
   perhaps time and freedom from asenath would do its work i could see
   that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again

   ill tell you more later  i must have a long rest now ill tell you
   something of the forbidden horrors she led me into  something of the
   ageold horrors that even now are festering in outoftheway corners
   with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive some people know
   things about the universe that nobody ought to know and can do things
   that nobody ought to be able to do ive been in it up to my neck but
   thats the end today id burn that damned necronomicon and all the
   rest if i were librarian at miskatonic

   but she cant get me now i must get out of that accursed house as
   soon as i can and settle down at home youll help me i know if i
   need help those devilish servants you know  and if people should get
   too inquisitive about asenath you see i cant give them her
   address then there are certain groups of searchers  certain cults
   you know  that might misunderstand our breaking up some of them
   have damnably curious ideas and methods i know youll stand by me if
   anything happens  even if i have to tell you a lot that will shock
   you

   i had edward stay and sleep in one of the guestchambers that night
   and in the morning he seemed calmer we discussed certain possible
   arrangements for his moving back into the derby mansion and i hoped he
   would lose no time in making the change he did not call the next
   evening but i saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks we talked
   as little as possible about strange and unpleasant things but
   discussed the renovation of the old derby house and the travels which
   edward promised to take with my son and me the following summer

   of asenath we said almost nothing for i saw that the subject was a
   peculiarly disturbing one gossip of course was rife; but that was no
   novelty in connection with the strange menage at the old crowninshield
   house one thing i did not like was what derbys banker let fall in an
   overexpansive mood at the miskatonic club  about the cheques edward
   was sending regularly to a moses and abigail sargent and a eunice
   babson in innsmouth that looked as if those evilfaced servants were
   extorting some kind of tribute from him  yet he had not mentioned the
   matter to me

   i wished that the summer  and my sons harvard vacation  would come
   so that we could get edward to europe he was not i soon saw mending
   as rapidly as i had hoped he would; for there was something a bit
   hysterical in his occasional exhilaration while his moods of fright
   and depression were altogether too frequent the old derby house was
   ready by december yet edward constantly put off moving though he
   hated and seemed to fear the crowninshield place he was at the same
   time queerly enslaved by it he could not seem to begin dismantling
   things and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action when i
   pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened his
   fathers old butler  who was there with other reacquired servants 
   told me one day that edwards occasional prowlings about the house and
   especially down cellar looked odd and unwholesome to him i wondered
   if asenath had been writing disturbing letters but the butler said
   there was no mail which could have come from her

   it was about christmas that derby broke down one evening while calling
   on me i was steering the conversation toward next summers travels
   when he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of
   shocking uncontrollable fright  a cosmic panic and loathing such as
   only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind

   my brain! my brain! god dan  its tugging  from beyond  knocking 
   clawing  that shedevil  even now  ephraim  kamog! kamog!  the pit
   of the shoggoths  ia! shubniggurath! the goat with a thousand
   young!

   the flame  the flame  beyond body beyond life  in the earth  oh
   god!

   i pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as
   his frenzy sank to a dull apathy he did not resist but kept his lips
   moving as if talking to himself presently i realized that he was
   trying to talk to me and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble
   words

   again again  shes trying  i might have known  nothing can stop
   that force; not distance nor magic nor death  it comes and comes
   mostly in the night  i cant leave  its horrible  oh god dan if
   you only knew as i do just how horrible it is

   when he had slumped down into a stupor i propped him with pillows and
   let normal sleep overtake him i did not call a doctor for i knew what
   would be said of his sanity and wished to give nature a chance if i
   possibly could he waked at midnight and i put him to bed upstairs
   but he was gone by morning he had let himself quietly out of the house
    and his butler when called on the wire said he was at home pacing
   about the library

   edward went to pieces rapidly after that he did not call again but i
   went daily to see him he would always be sitting in his library
   staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening sometimes
   he talked rationally but always on trivial topics any mention of his
   trouble of future plans or of asenath would send him into a frenzy
   his butler said he had frightful seizures at night during which he
   might eventually do himself harm

   i had a long talk with his doctor banker and lawyer and finally took
   the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him the spasms
   that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable  and
   that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the arkham
   sanitarium i was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly 
   almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks awesome whispers and
   dreadful droning repetitions of such phrases as i had to do it  i
   had to do it  itll get me  itll get me  down there  down there in
   the dark  mother! mother! dan! save me  save me 

   how much hope of recovery there was no one could say but i tried my
   best to be optimistic edward must have a home if he emerged so i
   transferred his servants to the derby mansion which would surely be
   his sane choice what to do about the crowninshield place with its
   complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects i
   could not decide so left it momentarily untouched  telling the derby
   household to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week and ordering
   the furnace man to have a fire on those days

   the final nightmare came before candlemas  heralded in cruel irony
   by a false gleam of hope one morning late in january the sanitarium
   telephoned to report that edwards reason had suddenly come back his
   continuous memory they said was badly impaired; but sanity itself was
   certain of course he must remain some time for observation but there
   could be little doubt of the outcome all going well he would surely
   be free in a week

   i hastened over in a flood of delight but stood bewildered when a
   nurse took me to edwards room the patient rose to greet me extending
   his hand with a polite smile; but i saw in an instant that he bore the
   strangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own
   nature  the competent personality i had found so vaguely horrible and
   which edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife
   there was the same blazing vision  so like asenaths and old ephraims
    and the same firm mouth; and when he spoke i could sense the same
   grim pervasive irony in his voice  the deep irony so redolent of
   potential evil this was the person who had driven my car through the
   night five months before  the person i had not seen since that brief
   call when he had forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such
   nebulous fears in me  and now he filled me with the same dim feeling
   of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness

   he spoke affably of arrangements for release  and there was nothing
   for me to do but assent despite some remarkable gaps in his recent
   memories yet i felt that something was terribly inexplicably wrong
   and abnormal there were horrors in this thing that i could not reach
   this was a sane person  but was it indeed the edward derby i had
   known? if not who or what was it  and where was edward? ought it to
   be free or confined  or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the
   earth? there was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the
   creature said  the asenathlike eyes lent a special and baffling
   mockery to certain words about the early liberty earned by an
   especially close confinement! i must have behaved very awkwardly and
   was glad to beat a retreat

   all that day and the next i racked my brain over the problem what had
   happened? what sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in
   edwards face? i could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma
   and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work the second morning
   the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged
   and by evening i was close to a nervous collapsea state i admit
   though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision i have nothing
   to say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for
   all the evidence

v[edit]

   it was in the nightafter that second evening  that stark utter
   horror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black clutching
   panic from which it can never shake free it began with a telephone
   call just before midnight i was the only one up and sleepily took
   down the receiver in the library no one seemed to be on the wire and
   i was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint
   suspicion of sound at the other end was someone trying under great
   difficulties to talk? as i listened i thought i heard a sort of
   halfliquid bubbling noise  glub glub glub  which had an odd
   suggestion of inarticulate unintelligible word and syllable divisions
   i called who is it? but the only answer was glub glub
   glubglub i could only assume that the noise was mechanical; but
   fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive
   but not to send i added i cant hear you better hang up and try
   information immediately i heard the receiver go on the hook at the
   other end

   this i say was just about midnight when the call was traced
   afterward it was found to come from the old crowninshield house though
   it was fully half a week from the housemaids day to be there i shall
   only hint what was found at that house  the upheaval in a remote
   cellar storeroom the tracks the dirt the hastily rifled wardrobe
   the baffling marks on the telephone the clumsily used stationery and
   the detestable stench lingering over everything the police poor
   fools have their smug little theories and are still searching for
   those sinister discharged servants  who have dropped out of sight
   amidst the present furore they speak of a ghoulish revenge for things
   that were done and say i was included because i was edwards best
   friend and adviser

   idiots! do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that
   handwriting? do they fancy they could have brought what later came? are
   they blind to the changes in that body that was edwards? as for me i
   now believe all that edward derby ever told me there are horrors
   beyond lifes edge that we do not suspect and once in a while mans
   evil prying calls them just within our range ephraim  asenath  that
   devil called them in and they engulfed edward as they are engulfing
   me

   can i be sure that i am safe? those powers survive the life of the
   physical form the next day  in the afternoon when i pulled out of my
   prostration and was able to walk and talk coherently  i went to the
   madhouse and shot him dead for edwards and the worlds sake but can i
   be sure till he is cremated? they are keeping the body for some silly
   autopsies by different doctors  but i say he must be cremated he must
   be cremated  he who was not edward derby when i shot him i shall go
   mad if he is not for i may be the next but my will is not weak  and
   i shall not let it be undermined by the terrors i know are seething
   around it one life  ephraim asenath and edward  who now? i will
   not be driven out of my body i will not change souls with that
   bulletridden lich in the madhouse!

   but let me try to tell coherently of that final horror i will not
   speak of what the police persistently ignored  the tales of that
   dwarfed grotesque malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers in
   high street just before two oclock and the nature of the single
   footprints in certain places i will say only that just about two the
   doorbell and knocker waked me  doorbell and knocker both aplied
   alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation and each
   trying to keep edwards old signal of threeandtwo strokes

   roused from sound sleep my mind leaped into a turmoil derby at the
   door  and remembering the old code! that new personality had not
   remembered it was edward suddenly back in his rightful state? why
   was he here in such evident stress and haste? had he been released
   ahead of time or had he escaped? perhaps i thought as i flung on a
   robe and bounded downstairs his return to his own self had brought
   raving and violence revoking his discharge and driving him to a
   desperate dash for freedom whatever had happened he was good old
   edward again and i would help him!

   when i opened the door into the elmarched blackness a gust of
   insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate i choked in nausea
   and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed humped figure on the steps
   the summons had been edwards but who was this foul stunted parody?
   where had edward had time to go? his ring had sounded only a second
   before the door opened

   the caller had on one of edwards overcoats  its bottom almost
   touching the ground and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the
   hands on the head was a slouch hat pulled low while a black silk
   muffler concealed the face as i stepped unsteadily forward the figure
   made a semiliquid sound like that i had heard over the telephone 
   glub glub  and thrust at me a large closely written paper
   impaled on the end of a long pencil still reeling from the morbid and
   unaccountable foetor i seized the paper and tried to read it in the
   light from the doorway

   beyond question it was in edwards script but why had he written when
   he was close enough to ring  and why was the script so awkward coarse
   and shaky? i could make out nothing in the dim half light so edged
   back into the hall the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but
   pausing on the inner doors threshold the odour of this singular
   messenger was really appalling and i hoped (not in vain thank god!)
   that my wife would not wake and confront it

   then as i read the paper i felt my knees give under me and my vision
   go black i was lying on the floor when i came to that accursed sheet
   still clutched in my fearrigid hand this is what it said

   dan  go to the sanitarium and kill it exterminate it it isnt
   edward derby any more she got me  its asenath  and she has been
   dead three months and a half i lied when i said she had gone away i
   killed her i had to it was sudden but we were alone and i was in my
   right body i saw a candlestick and smashed her head in she would have
   got me for good at hallowmass

   i buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and
   cleaned up all the traces the servants suspected next morning but
   they have such secrets that they dare not tell the police i sent them
   off but god knows what they  and others of the cult  will do

   i thought for a while i was all right and then i felt the tugging at
   my brain i knew what it was  i ought to have remembered a soul like
   hers  or ephraims  is half detached and keeps right on after death
   as long as the body lasts she was getting me  making me change bodies
   with herseizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers buried
   in the cellar

   i knew what was coming  thats why i snapped and had to go to the
   asylum then it came  i found myself choked in the dark  in asenaths
   rotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where i put
   it and i knew she must be in my body at the sanitarium  permanently
   for it was after hallowmass and the sacrifice would work even without
   her being there  sane and ready for release as a menace to the world
   i was desperate and in spite of everything i clawed my way out

   im too far gone to talk  i couldnt manage to telephone  but i can
   still write ill get fixed up somehow and bring this last word and
   warning kill that fiend if you value the peace and comfort of the
   world see that it is cremated if you dont it will live on and on
   body to body forever and i cant tell you what it will do keep clear
   of black magic dan its the devils business goodbye  youve been a
   great friend tell the police whatever theyll believe  and im
   damnably sorry to drag all this on you ill be at peace before long 
   this thing wont hold together much more hope you can read this and
   kill that thing  kill it

   yours  ed

   it was only afterward that i read the last half of this paper for i
   had fainted at the end of the third paragraph i fainted again when i
   saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had
   struck it the messenger would not move or have consciousness any more

   the butler tougherfibred than i did not faint at what met him in the
   hall in the morning instead he telephoned the police when they came
   i had been taken upstairs to bed but the  other mass  lay where it
   had collapsed in the night the men put handkerchiefs to their noses

   what they finally found inside edwards oddlyassorted clothes was
   mostly liquescent horror there were bones too  and a crushedin
   skull some dental work positively identified the skull as asenaths

             sedibus ut saltem placidis in morte quiescam^[1]
                                                        virgil

         in relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement
   within this refuge for the demented i am aware that my present
   position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my
   narrative it is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too
   limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence
   those isolated phenomena seen and felt only by a psychologically
   sensitive few which lie outside its common experience men of broader
   intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and
   the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the
   delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made
   conscious of them; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns
   as madness the flashes of supersight which penetrate the common veil
   of obvious empiricism

         my name is jervas dudley and from earliest childhood i have been
   a dreamer and a visionary wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial
   life and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social
   recreations of my acquaintances i have dwelt ever in realms apart from
   the visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and
   littleknown books and in roaming the fields and groves of the region
   near my ancestral home i do not think that what i read in these books
   or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and
   saw there; but of this i must say little since detailed speech would
   but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which i sometimes
   overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me it is
   sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causes

         i have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world but i have
   not said that i dwelt alone this no human creature may do; for lacking
   the fellowship of the living he inevitably draws upon the
   companionship of things that are not or are no longer living close
   by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow in whose twilight deeps
   i spent most of my time; reading thinking and dreaming down its
   mosscovered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken and around
   its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were
   woven well did i come to know the presiding dryads of those trees and
   often have i watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of
   waning moonbut of these things i must not now speak i will tell only
   of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted
   tomb of the hydes an old and exalted family whose last direct
   descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before
   my birth

         the vault to which i refer is an ancient granite weathered and
   discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations excavated back
   into the hillside the structure is visible only at the entrance the
   door a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone hangs upon rusted iron
   hinges and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of
   heavy iron chains and padlocks according to a gruesome fashion of half
   a century ago the abode of the race whose scions are inurned had once
   crowned the declivity which holds the tomb but had long since fallen
   victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of
   lightning of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion
   the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and
   uneasy voices; alluding to what they call divine wrath in a manner
   that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination
   which i felt for the forestdarkened sepulchre one man only had
   perished in the fire when the last of the hydes was buried in this
   place of shade and stillness the sad urnful of ashes had come from a
   distant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned
   down no one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal and few
   care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely
   about the waterworn stones

         i shall never forget the afternoon when first i stumbled upon the
   halfhidden house of the dead it was in midsummer when the alchemy
   of nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost
   homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are wellnigh intoxicated
   with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable
   odours of the soil and the vegetation in such surroundings the mind
   loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal and
   echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the
   enthralled consciousness all day i had been wandering through the
   mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts i need not discuss and
   conversing with things i need not name in years a child of ten i had
   seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged
   in certain respects when upon forcing my way between two savage
   clumps of briers i suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault i
   had no knowledge of what i had discovered the dark blocks of granite
   the door so curiously ajar and the funereal carvings above the arch
   arounsed in me no associations of mournful or terrible character of
   graves and tombs i knew and imagined much but had on account of my
   peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with
   churchyards and cemeteries the strange stone house on the woodland
   slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its
   cold damp interior into which i vainly peered through the aperture so
   tantalisingly left contained for me no hint of death or decay but in
   that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which
   has brought me to this hell of confinement spurred on by a voice which
   must have come from the hideous soul of the forest i resolved to enter
   the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my
   passage in the waning light of day i alternately rattled the rusty
   impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door and essayed to
   squeeze my slight form through the space already provided; but neither
   plan met with success at first curious i was now frantic; and when in
   the thickening twilight i returned to my home i had sworn to the
   hundred gods of the grove that at any cost i would some day force an
   entrance to the black chilly depths that seemed calling out to me the
   physician with the irongrey beard who comes each day to my room once
   told a visitor that this decision marked the beginnings of a pitiful
   monomania; but i will leave final judgement to my readers when they
   shall have learnt all

         the months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts
   to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault and in
   carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the
   structure with the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy i
   learned much; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one
   of my information or my resolve it is perhaps worth mentioning that i
   was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the
   vault my rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me
   to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion;
   and i felt that the great sinister family of the burneddown mansion
   was in some way represented within the stone space i sought to explore
   mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in
   the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb
   before whose door i would sit for hours at a time each day once i
   thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance but could see
   nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward the odour
   of the place repelled yet bewitched me i felt i had known it before
   in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the
   body i now possess

         the year after i first beheld the tomb i stumbled upon a
   wormeaten translation of plutarchs lives in the bookfilled attic of
   my home reading the life of theseus i was much impressed by that
   passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to
   find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift
   its enourmous weight this legend had the effect of dispelling my
   keenest impatience to enter the vault for it made me feel that the
   time was not yet ripe later i told myself i should grow to a
   strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily
   chained door with ease; but until then i would do better by conforming
   to what seemed the will of fate

         accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent
   and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits
   i would sometimes rise very quietly in the night stealing out to walk
   in those churchyards and places of burial from which i had been kept by
   my parents what i did there i may not say for i am not now sure of
   the reality of certain things; but i know that on the day after such a
   nocturnal ramble i would often astonish those about me with my
   knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations it was after
   a night like this that i shocked the community with a queer conceit
   about the burial of the rich and celebrated squire brewster a maker of
   local history who was interred in 1711 and whose slate headstone
   bearing a graven skull and crossbones was slowly crumbling to power
   in a moment of childish imagination i vowed not only that the
   undertaker goodman simpson had stolen the silverbuckled shoes
   silken hose and satin smallclothes of the deceased before burial; but
   that the squire himself not fully inanimate had turned twice in his
   moundcovered coffin on the day of interment

         but the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being
   indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discover that my own
   maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly
   extinct family of the hydes last of my paternal race i was likewise
   the last of this older and more mysterious line i began to feel that
   the tomb was mine and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time
   when i might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone
   steps in the dark i now formed the habit of listening very intently at
   the slightly open portal choosing my favourite hours of midnight
   stillness for the odd vigil by the time i came of age i had made a
   small clearing in the thicket before the mouldstained facade of the
   hillside allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang
   the space like the walls and roof of sylvan bower this bower was my
   temple the fastened door my shrine and here i would lie outstretched
   on the mossy ground thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange
   dreams

         the night of the first revelation was a sultry one i must have
   fallen asleep from fatigue for it was with a distinct sense of
   awakening that i heard the voices of those tones and accents i
   hesitate to speak; of their quality i will not speak; but i may say
   that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary
   pronunciation and mode of utterance every shade of new england
   dialect from the uncouth syllables of the puritan colonists to the
   precise rhetoric of fifty years ago seemed represented in that shadowy
   colloquy though it was only later that i noticed the fact at the
   time indeed my attention was distracted from this matter by another
   phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon
   its reality i barely fancied that as i awoke a light had been
   hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre i do not think i
   was either astounded or panicstricken but i know that i was greatly
   and permanently changed that night upon returning home i went with
   much directness to a rotting chest in the attic wherein i found the
   key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier i had so long stormed
   in vain

         it was in the soft glow of late afternoon that i first entered
   the vault on the abandoned slope a spell was upon me and my heart
   leaped with an exultation i can but ill describe as i closed the door
   behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone
   candle i seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with
   the stifling reek of the place i felt singularly at home in the musty
   charnelhouse air looking about me i beheld many marble slabs bearing
   coffins or the remains of coffins some of these were sealed and
   intact but others had nearly vanished leaving the silver handles and
   plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust upon one
   plate i read the name of sir geoffrey hyde who had come from sussex in
   1640 and died here a few years later in a conspicuous alcove was one
   fairly wellpreserved and untenanted casket adorned with a single name
   which brought to me both a smile and a shudder an odd impulse caused
   me to climb upon the broad slab extinguish my candle and lie down
   within the vacant box

         in the grey light of dawn i staggered from the vault and locked
   the chain of the door behind me i was no longer a young man though
   but twentyone winters had chilled my bodily frame earlyrising
   villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely and
   marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose
   life was known to be sober and solitary i did not appear before my
   parents till after a long and refreshing sleep

         henceforward i haunted the tomb each night; seeing hearing and
   doing things i must never reveal my speech always susceptible to
   environmental influences was the first thing to succumb to the change;
   and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon
   later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour till i
   unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite
   my lifelong seclusion my formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the
   easy grace of a chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a rochester i
   displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic monkish
   lore over which i had pored in youth; and covered the flyleaves of my
   books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of
   gay prior and the sprightliest of augustan wits and rimesters one
   morning at breakfast i came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably
   liquourish accents an effusion of eighteenthcentury bacchanalian
   mirth; a bit of georgian playfulness never recorded in a book which
   ran something like this:

   come hither my lads with your tankards of ale
   and drink to the present before it shall fail;
   pile each on your platter a mountain of beef
   for tis eating and drinking that bring us relief:
   so fill up your glass
   so life will soon pass;
   when youre dead yell neer drink to your king or your lass!
   anacreon had a red nose so they say;
   but whats a red nose if yere happy and gay?
   gad split me! id rather be red whilst im here
   than white as a lilyand dead half a year!
   so betty my miss
   come give me kiss;
   in hell theres no innkeepers daughter like this!
   young harry proppd up just as straight as hes able
   will soon lose his wig and slip under the table;
   but fill up your goblets and pass em around
   better under the table than under the ground!
   so revel and chaff
   as ye thirstily quaff:
   under six feet of dirt tis less easy to laugh!
   the fiend strike me blue! im scarce able to walk
   and damn me if i can stand upright or talk!
   here landlord bid betty to summon a chair;
   ill try home for a while for my wife is not there!
   so lend me a hand;
   im not able to stand
   but im gay whilst i linger on top of the land!

         about this time i conceived my present fear of fire and
   thunderstorms previously indifferent to such things i had now an
   unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses
   of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display a
   favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the
   mansion that had burned down and in fancy i would picture the
   structure as it had been in its prime on one occasion i startled a
   villager by leading him confidently to a shallow subcellar of whose
   existence i seemed to know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen
   and forgotten for many generations

         at last came that which i had long feared my parents alarmed at
   the altered manner and appearance of their only son commenced to exert
   over my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in
   disaster i had told no one of my visits to the tomb having guarded my
   secret purpose with religious zeal since childhood; but now i was
   forced to exercise care in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow
   that i might throw off a possible pursuer my key to the vault i kept
   suspended from a cord about my neck its presence known only to me i
   never carried out of the sepulchre any of the things i came upon whilst
   within its walls

         one morning as i emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the
   chain of the portal with none too steady hand i beheld in an adjacent
   thicket the dreaded face of a watcher surely the end was near; for my
   bower was discovered and the objective of my nocturnal journeys
   revealed the man did not accost me so i hastened home in an effort to
   overhear what he might report to my careworn father were my sojourns
   beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world? imagine my
   delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in cautious
   whisper that i had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my
   sleepfilmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal
   stood ajar! by what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? i was
   now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me made bold by
   this heavensent circumstance i began to resume perfect openness in
   going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance
   for a week i tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality
   which i must not describe when the thing happened and i was borne
   away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony

         i should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of
   thunder was in the clouds and hellish phosphorescence rose from the
   rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow the call of the dead too was
   different instead of the hillside tomb it was the charred cellar on
   the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with
   unseen fingers as i emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain
   before the ruin i beheld in the misty moonlight a thing i had always
   vaguely expected the mansion gone for a century once more reared its
   stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the
   splendour of many candles up the long drive rolled the coaches of the
   boston gentry whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered
   exquisites from the neighbouring mansions with this throng i mingled
   though i knew i belonged with the hosts rather than the guests inside
   the hall were music laughter and wine on every hand several faces i
   recognised; though i should have known them better had they been
   shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition amidst a wild and
   reckless throng i was the wildest and most abandoned gay blasphemy
   poured in torrents from my lips and in my shocking sallies i heeded no
   law of god man or nature suddenly a peal of thunder resonant even
   above the din of the swinish revelry clave the very roof and laid a
   hush of fear upon the boisterous company red tongues of flame and
   searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the roysterers struck
   with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the
   bounds of unguided nature fled shrieking into the night i alone
   remained riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which i had never
   felt before and then a second horror took possession of my soul burnt
   alive to ashes my body dispersed by the four winds i might never lie
   in the tomb of hydes! was not my coffin prepared for me? had i not a
   right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey
   hyde? aye! i would claim my heritage of death even though my soul go
   seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to represent it
   on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault jervas hyde should
   never share the sad fate of palinurus!

         as the phantom of the burning house faded i found myself
   screaming and struggling madly in the arms of two men one of whom was
   the spy who had followed me to the tomb rain was pouring down in
   torrents and upon the southern horizon were flashes of the lightning
   that had so lately passed over our heads my father his face lined
   with sorrow stood by as i shouted my demands to be laid within the
   tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they
   could a blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a
   violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious
   villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship
   which the thunderbolt had brought to light ceasing my futile and now
   objectless writhing i watched the spectators as they viewed the
   treasuretrove and was permitted to share in their discoveries the
   box whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it
   contained many papers and objects of value; but i had eyes for one
   thing alone it was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly
   curled bagwig and bore the initials jh the face was such that as
   i gazed i might well have been studying my mirror

         on the following day i was brought to this room with the barred
   windows but i have been kept informed of certain things through an
   aged and simpleminded servitor for whom i bore a fondness in infancy
   and who like me loves the churchyard what i have dared relate of my
   experiences within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles my
   father who visits me frequently declares that at no time did i pass
   the chained portal and swears that the rusted padlock had not been
   touched for fifty years when he examined it he even says that all the
   village knew of my journeys to the tomb and that i was often watched
   as i slept in the bower outside the grim facade my halfopen eyes
   fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior against these
   assertions i have no tangible proof to offer since my key to the
   padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors the strange
   things of the past which i learnt during those nocturnal meetings with
   the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and omnivorous
   browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library had it not
   been for my old servant hiram i should have by this time become quite
   convinced of my madness

         but hiram loyal to the last has held faith in me and has done
   that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story a week
   ago he burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb
   perpetually ajar and descended with a lantern into the murky depths
   on a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished
   plate bears the single word jervas in that coffin and in that vault
   they have promised me i shall be buried

   the transition of juan romero
   by h p lovecraft
   14846the transition of juan romeroh p lovecraft

   of the events which took place at the norton mine on october eighteenth
   and nineteenth 1894 i have no desire to speak a sense of duty to
   science is all that impels me to recall in the last years of my life
   scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because i
   cannot wholly define it but i believe that before i die i should tell
   what i know of the  shall i say transition  of juan romero

   my name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact i fancy
   it is better that they should not be for when a man suddenly migrates
   to the states or the colonies he leaves his past behind him besides
   what i once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save
   perhaps the fact that during my service in india i was more at home
   amongst whitebearded native teachers than amongst my brotherofficers
   i had delved not a little into odd eastern lore when overtaken by the
   calamities which brought about my new life in americas vast west  a
   life wherein i found it well to accept a name  my present one  which
   is very common and carries no meaning

   in the summer and autumn of 1894 i dwelt in the drear expanses of the
   cactus mountains employed as a common labourer at the celebrated
   norton mine whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before
   had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a
   seething cauldron of sordid life a cavern of gold lying deep beneath
   a mountain lake had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest
   dreams and now formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on
   the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold
   additional grottoes had been found and the yield of yellow metal was
   exceedingly great; so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners
   toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows the
   superintendent a mr arthur often discussed the singularity of the
   local geological formations; speculating on the probable extent of the
   chain of caves and estimating the future of the titanic mining
   enterprises he considered the auriferous cavities the result of the
   action of water and believed the last of them would soon be opened

   it was not long after my arrival and employment that juan romero came
   to the norton mine one of the large herd of unkempt mexicans attracted
   thither from the neighbouring country he at first attracted attention
   only because of his features; which though plainly of the red indian
   type were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined
   conformation being vastly unlike those of the average greaser or
   piute of the locality it is curious that although he differed so
   widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians romero gave
   not the least impression of caucasian blood it was not the castilian
   conquistador or the american pioneer but the ancient and noble aztec
   whom imagination called to view when the silent peon would rise in the
   early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it crept above the
   eastern hills meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in
   the performance of some rite whose nature he did not himself
   comprehend but save for his face romero was not in any way suggestive
   of nobility ignorant and dirty he was at home amongst the other
   brownskinned mexicans; having come (so i was afterward told) from the
   very lowest sort of surroundings he had been found as a child in a
   crude mountain hut the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked
   lethally by near the hut close to a rather unusual rock fissure had
   lain two skeletons newly picked by vultures and presumably forming
   the sole remains of his parents no one recalled their identity and
   they were soon forgotten by the many indeed the crumbling of the
   adobe hut and the closing of the rockfissure by a subsequent avalanche
   had helped to efface even the scene from recollection reared by a
   mexican cattlethief who had given him his name juan differed little
   from his fellows

   the attachment which romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly
   commenced through the quaint and ancient hindoo ring which i wore when
   not engaged in active labour of its nature and manner of coming into
   my possession i cannot speak it was my last link with a chapter of my
   life forever closed and i valued it highly soon i observed that the
   oddlooking mexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an
   expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness its hoary
   hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but
   active mind though he could not possibly have beheld their like
   before within a few weeks after his advent romero was like a faithful
   servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact that i was myself but an
   ordinary miner our conversation was necessarily limited he knew but a
   few words of english while i found my oxonian spanish was something
   quite different from the patois of the peon of new spain

   the event which i am about to relate was unheralded by long
   premonitions though the man romero had interested me and though my
   ring had affected him peculiarly i think that neither of us had any
   expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off
   geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine
   directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and
   the belief of the superintendent that only solid rock would be
   encountered had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite
   with this work romero and i were not connected wherefore our first
   knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others the charge
   heavier perhaps than had been estimated had seemed to shake the entire
   mountain windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by
   the shock whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked
   from their feet jewel lake which lay above the scene of action
   heaved as in a tempest upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss
   yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous
   that no handy line might fathom it nor any lamp illuminate it
   baffled the excavators sought a conference with the superintendent
   who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit and spliced
   and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered

   shortly afterward the palefaced workmen apprised the superintendent of
   their failure firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal
   to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it
   might be sealed something beyond their experience was evidently
   confronting them for so far as they could ascertain the void below
   was infinite the superintendent did not reproach them instead he
   pondered deeply and made plans for the following day the night shift
   did not go on that evening

   at two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl
   dismally from somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer;
   either to the coyote  or to something else a storm was gathering
   around the peaks of the range and weirdly shaped clouds scudded
   horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a
   gibbous moons attempts to shine through many layers of cirrostratus
   vapours it was romeros voice coming from the bunk above that
   awakened me a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation i
   could not understand:

   madre de dios!  el sonido  ese sonido  oiga vd!  lo oye vd? 
   señor that sound!

   i listened wondering what sound he meant the coyote the dog the
   storm all were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the
   wind shrieked more and more frantically flashes of lightning were
   visible through the bunkhouse window i questioned the nervous
   mexican repeating the sounds i had heard:

   el coyote  el perro  el viento?

   but romero did not reply then he commenced whispering as in awe:

   el ritmo señor  el ritmo de la tierra  that throb down in the
   ground!

   and now i also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why deep
   deep below me was a sound  a rhythm just as the peon had said 
   which though exceedingly faint yet dominated even the dog the
   coyote and the increasing tempest to seek to describe it was useless
    for it was such that no description is possible perhaps it was like
   the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner as sensed from
   the deck yet it was not so mechanical; not so devoid of the element of
   the life and consciousness of all its qualities remoteness in the
   earth most impressed me to my mind rushed fragments of a passage in
   joseph glanvil which poe has quoted with tremendous effect^[1]:

    the vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his works
   which have a depth in them greater than the well of democritus

   suddenly romero leaped from his bunk pausing before me to gaze at the
   strange ring on my hand which glistened queerly in every flash of
   lightning and then staring intently in the direction of the mine
   shaft i also rose and both of us stood motionless for a time
   straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take
   on a vital quality then without apparent volition we began to move
   toward the door whose rattling in the gale held a comforting
   suggestion of earthly reality the chanting in the depths  for such
   the sound now seemed to be  grew in volume and distinctness; and we
   felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping
   blackness of the shaft

   we encountered no living creature for the men of the night shift had
   been released from duty and were doubtless at the dry gulch settlement
   pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender from
   the watchmans cabin however gleamed a small square of yellow light
   like a guardian eye i dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had
   affected the watchman; but romero was moving more swiftly now and i
   followed without pausing

   as we descended the shaft the sound beneath grew definitely composite
   it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony with beating
   of drums and chanting of many voices i have as you are aware been
   much in india romero and i moved without material hesitancy through
   drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us yet
   ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance at one time i
   fancied i had gone mad  this was when on wondering how our way was
   lighted in the absence of lamp or candle i realized that the ancient
   ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance diffusing a pallid
   lustre through the damp heavy air around

   it was without warning that romero after clambering down one of the
   many wide ladders broke into a run and left me alone some new and
   wild note in the drumming and chanting perceptible but slightly to me
   had acted on him in a startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he
   forged ahead unguided in the caverns gloom i heard his repeated
   shrieks before me as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and
   scrambled madly down the rickety ladders and frightened as i was i
   yet retained enough of my perception to note that his speech when
   articulate was not of any sort known to me harsh but impressive
   polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad spanish and
   worse english and of these only the oft repeated cry
   huitzilopotchli seemed in the least familiar later i definitely
   placed that word in the works of a great historian^[2]  and shuddered
   when the association came to me

   the climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief
   beginning just as i reached the final cavern of the journey out of the
   darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the mexican which
   was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as i could never hear
   again and survive in that moment it seemed as if all the hidden
   terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort
   to overwhelm the human race simultaneously the light from my ring was
   extinguished and i saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a
   few yards ahead of me i had arrived at the abyss which was now redly
   aglow and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate romero
   advancing i peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could
   fathom and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous
   uproar at first i beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity;
   but then shapes all infinitely distant began to detach themselves
   from the confusion and i saw  was it juan romero?  but god! i dare
   not tell you what i saw! some power from heaven coming to my aid
   obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when
   two universes collide in space chaos supervened and i knew the peace
   of oblivion

   i hardly know how to continue since conditions so singular are
   involved; but i will do my best not even trying to differentiate
   betwixt the real and the apparent when i awakened i was safe in my
   bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window some distance
   away the lifeless body of juan romero lay upon a table surrounded by a
   group of men including the camp doctor the men were discussing the
   strange death of the mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly
   connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had
   struck and shaken the mountain no direct cause was evident and an
   autopsy failed to show any reason why romero should not be living
   snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither romero
   nor i had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither of us had
   been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the cactus
   range that storm said men who had ventured down the mine shaft had
   caused extensive cavingin and had completely closed the deep abyss
   which had created so much apprehension the day before when i asked the
   watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt; he
   mentioned a coyote a dog and the snarling mountain wind  nothing
   more nor do i doubt his word

   upon the resumption of work superintendent arthur called upon some
   especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot
   where the gulf had appeared though hardly eager they obeyed and a
   deep boring was made results were very curious the roof of the void
   as seen when it was open was not by any means thick; yet now the
   drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent
   of solid rock finding nothing else not even gold the superintendent
   abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over
   his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk

   one other thing is curious shortly after waking on that morning after
   the storm i noticed the unaccountable absence of my hindoo ring from
   my finger i had prized it greatly yet nevertheless felt a sensation
   of relief at its disappearance if one of my fellowminers appropriated
   it he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty for
   despite advertisements and a police search the ring was never seen
   again somehow i doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands for many
   strange things were taught me in india

   my opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time in broad
   daylight and at most seasons i am apt to think the greater part of it
   a mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn about two in the morning
   when the winds and animals howl dismally there comes from
   inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical
   throbbing and i feel that the transition of juan romero was a
   terrible one indeed

   it was on a certain thursday morning in december that the whole thing
   began with that unaccountable motion i thought i saw in my antique
   copenhagen mirror something it seemed to me stirredsomething
   reflected in the glass though i was alone in my quarters i paused and
   looked intently then deciding that the effect must be a pure
   illusion resumed the interrupted brushing of my hair

   i had discovered the old mirror covered with dust and cobwebs in an
   outbuilding of an abandoned estatehouse in santa cruzs sparsely
   settled northside territory and had brought it to the united states
   from the virgin islands the venerable glass was dim from more than two
   hundred years exposure to a tropical climate and the graceful
   ornamentation along the top of the gilt frame had been badly smashed i
   had had the detached pieces set back into the frame before placing it
   in storage with my other belongings

   now several years later i was staying half as a guest and half as a
   tutor at the private school of my old friend browne on a windy
   connecticut hillsideoccupying an unused wing in one of the
   dormitories where i had two rooms and a hallway to myself the old
   mirror stowed securely in mattresses was the first of my possessions
   to be unpacked on my arrival; and i had set it up majestically in the
   livingroom on top of an old rosewood console which had belonged to my
   greatgrandmother

   the door of my bedroom was just opposite that of the livingroom with
   a hallway between; and i had noticed that by looking into my chiffonier
   glass i could see the larger mirror through the two doorwayswhich was
   exactly like glancing down an endless though diminishing corridor on
   this thursday morning i thought i saw a curious suggestion of motion
   down that normally empty corridorbut as i have said soon dismissed
   the notion

   when i reached the diningroom i found everyone complaining of the
   cold and learned that the schools heatingplant was temporarily out
   of order being especially sensitive to low temperatures i was myself
   an acute sufferer; and at once decided not to brave any freezing
   schoolroom that day accordingly i invited my class to come over to my
   livingroom for an informal session around my gratefirea suggestion
   which the boys received enthusiastically

   after the session one of the boys robert grandison asked if he might
   remain; since he had no appointment for the second morning period i
   told him to stay and welcome he sat down to study in front of the
   fireplace in a comfortable chair

   it was not long however before robert moved to another chair somewhat
   farther away from the freshly replenished blaze this change bringing
   him directly opposite the old mirror from my own chair in another part
   of the room i noticed how fixedly he began to look at the dim cloudy
   glass and wondering what so greatly interested him was reminded of
   my own experience earlier that morning as time passed he continued to
   gaze a slight frown knitting his brows

   at last i quietly asked him what had attracted his attention slowly
   and still wearing the puzzled frown he looked over and replied rather
   cautiously:

   its the corrugations in the glassor whatever they are mr canevin
   i was noticing how they all seem to run from a certain point
   lookill show you what i mean

   the boy jumped up went over to the mirror and placed his finger on a
   point near its lower lefthand corner

   its right here sir he explained turning to look toward me and
   keeping his finger on the chosen spot

   his muscular action in turning may have pressed his finger against the
   glass suddenly he withdrew his hand as though with some slight effort
   and with a faintly muttered ouch then he looked at the glass in
   obvious mystification

   what happened? i asked rising and approaching

   whyit he seemed embarrassed itifeltwell as though it
   were pulling my finger into it seemserperfectly foolish sir
   butwellit was a most peculiar sensation robert had an unusual
   vocabulary for his fifteen years

   i came over and had him show me the exact spot he meant

   youll think im rather a fool sir he said shamefacedly
   butwell from right here i cant be absolutely sure from the chair
   it seemed to be clear enough

   now thoroughly interested i sat down in the chair robert had occupied
   and looked at the spot he selected on the mirror instantly the thing
   jumped out at me unmistakably from that particular angle all the
   many whorls in the ancient glass appeared to converge like a large
   number of spread strings held in one hand and radiating out in streams

   getting up and crossing to the mirror i could no longer see the
   curious spot only from certain angles apparently was it visible
   directly viewed that portion of the mirror did not even give back a
   normal reflectionfor i could not see my face in it manifestly i had
   a minor puzzle on my hands

   presently the school gong sounded and the fascinated robert grandison
   departed hurriedly leaving me alone with my odd little problem in
   optics i raised several windowshades crossed the hallway and sought
   for the spot in the chiffonier mirrors reflection finding it readily
   i looked very intently and thought i again detected something of the
   motion i craned my neck and at last at a certain angle of vision
   the thing again jumped out at me

   the vague motion was now positive and definitean appearance of
   torsional movement or of whirling; much like a minute yet intense
   whirlwind or waterspout or a huddle of autumn leaves dancing
   circularly in an eddy of wind along a level lawn it was like the
   earths a double motionaround and around and at the same time
   inward as if the whorls poured themselves endlessly toward some point
   inside the glass fascinated yet realizing that the thing must be an
   illusion i grasped an impression of quite distinct suction and
   thought of roberts embarrassed explanation: i felt as though it were
   pulling my finger into it

   a kind of slight chill ran suddenly up and down my backbone there was
   something here distinctly worth looking into and as the idea of
   investigation came to me i recalled the rather wistful expression of
   robert grandison when the gong called him to class i remembered how he
   had looked back over his shoulder as he walked obediently out into the
   hallway and resolved that he should be included in whatever analysis i
   might make of this little mystery

   exciting events connected with that same robert however were soon to
   chase all thoughts of the mirror from my consciousness for a time i
   was away all that afternoon and did not return to the school until the
   fivefifteen callovera general assembly at which the boys
   attendance was compulsory dropping in at this function with the idea
   of picking robert up for a session with the mirror i was astonished
   and pained to find him absenta very unusual and unaccountable thing
   in his case that evening browne told me that the boy had actually
   disappeared a search in his room in the gymnasium and in all other
   accustomed places being unavailing though all his
   belongingsincluding his outdoor clothingwere in their proper
   places

   he had not been encountered on the ice or with any of the hiking groups
   that afternoon and telephone calls to all the schoolcatering
   merchants of the neighborhood were in vain there was in short no
   record of his having been seen since the end of the lesson periods at
   twofifteen; when he had turned up the stairs toward his room in
   dormitory number three

   when the disappearance was fully realized the resulting sensation was
   tremendous throughout the school browne as headmaster had to bear
   the brunt of it; and such an unprecedented occurrence in his
   wellregulated highly organized institution left him quite bewildered
   it was learned that robert had not run away to his home in western
   pennsylvania nor did any of the searchingparties of boys and masters
   find any trace of him in the snowy countryside around the school so
   far as could be seen he had simply vanished

   roberts parents arrived on the afternoon of the second day after his
   disappearance they took their trouble quietly though of course they
   were staggered by this unexpected disaster browne looked ten years
   older for it but there was absolutely nothing that could be done by
   the fourth day the case had settled down in the opinion of the school
   as an insoluble mystery mr and mrs grandison went reluctantly back
   to their home and on the following morning the ten days christmas
   vacation began

   boys and masters departed in anything but the usual holiday spirit; and
   browne and his wife were left along with the servants as my only
   fellowoccupants of the big place without the masters and boys it
   seemed a very hollow shell indeed

   that afternoon i sat in front of my gratefire thinking about roberts
   disappearance and evolving all sorts of fantastic theories to account
   for it by evening i had acquired a bad headache and ate a light
   supper accordingly then after a brisk walk around the massed
   buildings i returned to my livingroom and took up the burden of
   thought once more

   a little after ten oclock i awakened in my armchair stiff and
   chilled from a doze during which i had let the fire go out i was
   physically uncomfortable yet mentally aroused by a peculiar sensation
   of expectancy and possible hope of course it had to do with the
   problem that was harassing me for i had started from that inadvertent
   nap with a curious persistent ideathe odd idea that a tenuous
   hardly recognizable robert grandison had been trying desperately to
   communicate with me i finally went to bed with one conviction
   unreasoningly strong in my mind somehow i was sure that young robert
   grandison was still alive

   that i should be receptive of such a notion will not seem strange to
   those who know my long residence in the west indies and my close
   contact with unexplained happenings there it will not seem strange
   either that i fell asleep with an urgent desire to establish some sort
   of mental communication with the missing boy even the most prosaic
   scientists affirm with freud jung and adler that the subconscious
   mind is most open to external impressions in sleep; though such
   impressions are seldom carried over intact into the waking state

   going a step further and granting the existence of telepathic forces
   it follows that such forces must act most strongly on a sleeper; so
   that if i were ever to get a definite message from robert it would be
   during a period of profoundest slumber of course i might lose the
   message in waking; but my aptitude for retaining such things has been
   sharpened by types of mental discipline picked up in various obscure
   corners of the globe

   i must have dropped asleep instantaneously and from the vividness of
   my dreams and the absence of wakeful intervals i judge that my sleep
   was a very deep one it was sixfortyfive when i awakened and there
   still lingered with me certain impressions which i knew were carried
   over from the world of somnolent cerebration filling my mind was the
   vision of robert grandison strangely transformed to a boy of a dull
   greenish darkblue color; robert desperately endeavoring to communicate
   with me by means of speech yet finding some almost insuperable
   difficulty in so doing a wall of curious spatial separation seemed to
   stand between him and mea mysterious invisible wall which completely
   baffled us both

   i had seen robert as though at some distance yet queerly enough he
   seemed at the same time to be just beside me he was both larger and
   smaller than in real life his apparent size varying directly instead
   of inversely with the distance as he advanced and retreated in the
   course of conversation that is he grew larger instead of smaller to
   my eye when he stepped away or backwards and vice versa; as if the
   laws of perspective in his case had been wholly reversed his aspect
   was misty and uncertainas if he lacked sharp or permanent outlines;
   and the anomalies of his coloring and clothing baffled me utterly at
   first

   at some point in my dream roberts vocal efforts had finally
   crystallized into audible speechalbeit speech of an abnormal
   thickness and dullness i could not for a time understand anything he
   said and even in the dream racked my brain for a clue to where he was
   what he wanted to tell and why his utterance was so clumsy and
   unintelligible then little by little i began to distinguish words and
   phrases the very first of which sufficed to throw my dreaming self
   into the wildest excitement and to establish a certain mental
   connection which had previously refused to take conscious form because
   of the utter incredibility of what it implied

   i do not know how long i listened to those halting words amidst my deep
   slumber but hours must have passed while the strangely remote speaker
   struggled on with his tale there was revealed to me such a
   circumstance as i cannot hope to make others believe without the
   strongest corroborative evidence yet which i was quite ready to accept
   as truthboth in the dream and after wakingbecause of my former
   contacts with uncanny things the boy was obviously watching my
   facemobile in receptive sleepas he choked along; for about the time
   i began to comprehend him his own expression brightened and gave signs
   of gratitude and hope

   any attempt to hint at roberts message as it lingered in my ears
   after a sudden awakening in the cold brings this narrative to a point
   where i must choose my words with the greatest care everything
   involved is so difficult to record that one tends to flounder
   helplessly i have said that the revelation established in my mind a
   certain connection which reason had not allowed me to formulate
   consciously before this connection i need no longer hesitate to hint
   had to do with the old copenhagen mirror whose suggestions of motion
   had so impressed me on the morning of the disappearance and whose
   whorllike contours and apparent illusions of suction had later exerted
   such a disquieting fascination on both robert and me

   resolutely though my outer consciousness had previously rejected what
   my intuition would have liked to imply it could reject that stupendous
   conception no longer what was fantasy in the tale of alice now came
   to me as a grave and immediate reality that lookingglass had indeed
   possessed a malign abnormal suction; and the struggling speaker in my
   dream made clear the extent to which it violated all the known
   precedents of human experience and all the ageold laws of our three
   sane dimensions it was more than a mirrorit was a gate; a trap; a
   link with spatial recesses not meant for the denizens of our visible
   universe and realizable only in terms of the most intricate
   noneuclidean mathematics and in some outrageous fashion robert
   grandison had passed out of our ken into the glass and was there
   immured waiting for release

   it is significant that upon awakening i harbored no genuine doubt of
   the reality of the revelation that i had actually held conversation
   with a transdimensional robert rather than evoked the whole episode
   from my broodings about his disappearance and about the old illusions
   of the mirror was as certain to my utmost instincts as any of the
   instinctive certainties commonly recognized as valid the tale thus
   unfolded to me was of the most incredibly bizarre character as had
   been clear on the morning of his disappearance robert was intensely
   fascinated by the ancient mirror all through the hours of school he
   had it in mind to come back to my livingroom and examine it further
   when he did arrive after the close of the school day it was somewhat
   later than twotwenty and i was absent in town finding me out and
   knowing that i would not mind he had come into my livingroom and gone
   straight to the mirror; standing before it and studying the place
   where as we had noted the whorls appeared to converge

   then quite suddenly there had come to him an overpowering urge to
   place his hand upon this whorlcenter almost reluctantly against his
   better judgment he had done so; and upon making the contact had felt
   at once the strange almost painful suction which had perplexed him
   that morning immediately thereafterquite without warning but with a
   wrench which seemed to twist and tear every bone and muscle in his body
   and to bulge and press and cut at every nervehe had been abruptly
   drawn through and found himself inside

   once through the excruciatingly painful stress upon his entire system
   was suddenly released he felt he said as though he had just been
   borna feeling that made itself evident every time he tried to do
   anything; walk stoop turn his head or utter speech everything about
   his body seemed a misfit

   these sensations wore off after a long while roberts body becoming an
   organized whole rather than a number of protesting parts of all the
   forms of expression speech remained the most difficult; doubtless
   because it is complicated bringing into play a number of different
   organs muscles and tendons roberts feet on the other hand were
   the first members to adjust themselves to the new conditions within the
   glass

   during the morning hours i rehearsed the whole reasondefying problem;
   correlating everything i had seen and heard dismissing the natural
   scepticism of a man of sense and scheming to devise possible plans for
   roberts release from his incredible prison as i did so a number of
   originally perplexing points became clearor at least clearerto me

   there was for example the matter of roberts coloring his face and
   hands as i have indicated were a kind of dull greenish darkblue; and
   i may add that his familiar blue norfolk jacket had turned to a pale
   lemonyellow while his trousers remained a neutral gray as before
   reflecting on this after waking i found the circumstance closely
   allied to the reversal of perspective which made robert seem to grow
   larger when receding and smaller when approaching here too was a
   physical reversalfor every detail of his coloring in the unknown
   dimension was the exact reverse or complement of the corresponding
   color detail in normal life in physics the typical complementary
   colors are blue and yellow and red and green these pairs are
   opposites and when mixed yield gray roberts natural color was a
   pinkishbuff the opposite of which is the greenishblue i saw his
   blue coat had become yellow while the gray trousers remained gray
   this latter point baffled me until i remembered that gray is itself a
   mixture of opposites there is no opposite for grayor rather it is
   its own opposite

   another clarified point was that pertaining to roberts curiously
   dulled and thickened speechas well as to the general awkwardness and
   sense of misfit bodily parts of which he complained this at the
   outset was a puzzle indeed; though after long thought the clue
   occurred to me here again was the same reversal which affected
   perspective and coloration anyone in the fourth dimension must
   necessarily be reversed in just this wayhands and feet as well as
   colors and perspectives being changed about it would be the same with
   all the other dual organs such as nostrils ears and eyes thus
   robert had been talking with a reversed tongue teeth vocal cords and
   kindred speechapparatus; so that his difficulties in utterance were
   little to be wondered at

   as the morning wore on my sense of the stark reality and maddening
   urgency of the dreamdisclosed situation increased rather than
   decreased more and more i felt that something must be done yet
   realized that i could not seek advice or aid such a story as minea
   conviction based upon mere dreamingcould not conceivably bring me
   anything but ridicule or suspicions as to my mental state and what
   indeed could i do aided or unaided with as little working data as my
   nocturnal impressions had provided? i must i finally recognized have
   more information before i could even think of a possible plan for
   releasing robert this could come only through the receptive conditions
   of sleep and it heartened me to reflect that according to every
   probability my telepathic contact would be resumed the moment i fell
   into deep slumber again

   i accomplished sleeping that afternoon after a midday dinner at which
   through rigid selfcontrol i succeeded in concealing from browne and
   his wife the tumultuous thoughts that crashed through my mind hardly
   had my eyes closed when a dim telepathic image began to appear; and i
   soon realized to my infinite excitement that it was identical with what
   i had seen before if anything it was more distinct; and when it began
   to speak i seemed able to grasp a greater proportion of the words

   during this sleep i found most of the mornings deductions confirmed
   though the interview was mysteriously cut off long prior to my
   awakening robert had seemed apprehensive just before communication
   ceased but had already told me that in his strange fourthdimensional
   prison colors and spatial relationships were indeed reversedblack
   being white distance increasing apparent size and so on he had also
   intimated that notwithstanding his possession of full physical form
   and sensations most human vital properties seemed curiously suspended
   nutriment for example was quite unnecessarya phenomenon really more
   singular than the omnipresent reversal of objects and attributes since
   the latter was a reasonable and mathematically indicated state of
   things another significant piece of information was that the only exit
   from the glass to the world was the entranceway and that this was
   permanently barred and impenetrably sealed so far as egress was
   concerned

   that night i had another visitation from robert; nor did such
   impressions received at odd intervals while i slept receptively
   minded cease during the entire period of his incarceration his
   efforts to communicate were desperate and often pitiful; for at times
   the telepathic bond would weaken while at other times fatigue
   excitement or fear of interruption would hamper and thicken his
   speech i may as well narrate as a continuous whole all that robert
   told me throughout the whole series of transient mental
   contactsperhaps supplementing it at certain points with facts
   directly related after his release the telepathic information was
   fragmentary and often nearly inarticulate but i studied it over and
   over during the waking intervals of three intense days; classifying and
   cogitating with feverish diligence since it was all that i had to go
   upon if the boy were to be brought back into our world

   the fourthdimensional region in which robert found himself was not as
   in scientific romance an unknown and infinite realm of strange sights
   and fantastic denizens; but was rather a projection of certain limited
   parts of our own terrestrial sphere within an alien and normally
   inaccessible aspect or direction of space it was a curiously
   fragmentary intangible and heterogeneous worlda series of
   apparently dissociated scenes merging indistinctly one into the other;
   their constituent details having an obviously different status from
   that of an object drawn into the ancient mirror as robert had been
   drawn these scenes were like dreamvistas or magiclantern
   imageselusive visual impressions of which the boy was not really a
   part but which formed a sort of panoramic background or ethereal
   environment against which or amidst which he moved

   he could not touch any of the parts of these sceneswalls trees
   furniture and the likebut whether this was because they were truly
   nonmaterial or because they always receded at his approach he was
   singularly unable to determine everything seemed fluid mutable and
   unreal when he walked it appeared to be on whatever lower surface the
   visible scene might havefloor path greensward or such; but upon
   analysis he always found that the contact was an illusion there was
   never any difference in the resisting force met by his feetand by his
   hands when he would stoop experimentallyno matter what changes of
   apparent surface might be involved he could not describe this
   foundation or limiting plane on which he walked as anything more
   definite than a virtually abstract pressure balancing his gravity of
   definite tactile distinctiveness it had none and supplementing it
   there seemed to be a kind of restricted levitational force which
   accomplished transfers of altitude he could never actually climb
   stairs yet would gradually walk up from a lower level to a higher

   passage from one definite scene to another involved a sort of gliding
   through a region of shadow or blurred focus where the details of each
   scene mingled curiously all the vistas were distinguished by the
   absence of transient objects and the indefinite or ambiguous
   appearance of such semitransient objects as furniture or details of
   vegetation the lighting of every scene was diffuse and perplexing and
   of course the scheme of reversed colorsbright red grass yellow sky
   with confused black and gray cloudforms white treetrunks and green
   brick wallsgave to everything an air of unbelievable grotesquerie
   there was an alteration of day and night which turned out to be a
   reversal of the normal hours of light and darkness at whatever point on
   the earth the mirror might be hanging

   this seemingly irrelevant diversity of the scenes puzzled robert until
   he realized that they comprised merely such places as had been
   reflected for long continuous periods in the ancient glass this also
   explained the odd absence of transient objects the generally arbitrary
   boundaries of vision and the fact that all exteriors were framed by
   the outlines of doorways or windows the glass it appeared had power
   to store up these intangible scenes through long exposure; though it
   could never absorb anything corporeally as robert had been absorbed
   except by a very different and particular process

   butto me at leastthe most incredible aspect of the mad phenomenon
   was the monstrous subversion of our known laws of space involved in the
   relation of various illusory scenes to the actual terrestrial regions
   represented i have spoken of the glass as storing up the images of
   these regions but this is really an inexact definition in truth each
   of the mirror scenes formed a true and quasipermanent
   fourthdimensional projection of the corresponding mundane region; so
   that whenever robert moved to a certain part of a certain scene as he
   moved into the image of my room when sending his telepathic messages
   he was actually in that place itself on earththough under spatial
   conditions which cut off all sensory communication in either
   direction between him and the present tridimensional aspect of the
   place

   theoretically speaking a prisoner in the glass could in a few moments
   go anywhere on our planetinto any place that is which had ever been
   reflected in the mirrors surface this probably applied even to places
   where the mirror had not hung long enough to produce a clear illusory
   scene; the terrestrial region being then represented by a zone of more
   or less formless shadow outside the definite scenes was a seemingly
   limitless waste of neutral gray shadow about which robert could never
   be certain and into which he never dared stray far lest he become
   hopelessly lost to the real and mirror worlds alike

   among the earliest particulars which robert gave was the fact that he
   was not alone in his confinement various others all in antique garb
   were in there with hima corpulent middleaged gentleman with tied
   queue and velvet kneebreeches who spoke english fluently though with a
   marked scandinavian accent; a rather beautiful small girl with very
   blonde hair which appeared a glossy dark blue; two apparently mute
   negroes whose features contrasted grotesquely with the pallor of their
   reversedcolored skins; three young men; one young woman; a very small
   child almost an infant; and a lean elderly dane of extremely
   distinctive aspect and a kind of halfmalign intellectuality of
   countenance

   this lastnamed individualaxel holm who wore the satin
   smallclothes flaredskirted coat and voluminous fullbottomed
   periwig of an age more than two centuries in the pastwas notable
   among the little band as being the one responsible for the presence of
   them all he it was who skilled equally in the arts of magic and glass
   working had long ago fashioned this strange dimensional prison in
   which himself his slaves and those whom he chose to invite or allure
   thither were immured unchangingly for as long as the mirror might
   endure holm was born early in the seventeenth century and had
   followed with tremendous competence and success the trade of a
   glassblower and molder in copenhagen his glass especially in the
   form of large drawingroom mirrors was always at a premium but the
   same bold mind which had made him the first glazier of europe also
   served to carry his interests and ambitions far beyond the sphere of
   mere material craftsmanship he had studied the world around him and
   chafed at the limitations of human knowledge and capability eventually
   he sought for dark ways to overcome those limitations and gained more
   success than is good for any mortal

   he had aspired to enjoy something like eternity the mirror being his
   provision to secure this end serious study of the fourth dimension was
   far from beginning with einstein in our own era; and holm more than
   erudite in all the methods of his day knew that a bodily entrance into
   that hidden phase of space would prevent him from dying in the ordinary
   physical sense research showed him that the principle of reflection
   undoubtedly forms the chief gate to all dimensions beyond our familiar
   three; and chance placed in his hands a small and very ancient glass
   whose cryptic properties he believed he could turn to advantage once
   inside this mirror according to the method he had envisaged he felt
   that life in the sense of form and consciousness would go on
   virtually forever provided the mirror could be preserved indefinitely
   from breakage or deterioration

   holm made a magnificent mirror such as would be prized and carefully
   preserved; and in it deftly fused the strange whorlconfigured relic he
   had acquired having thus prepared his refuge and his trap he began to
   plan his mode of entrance and conditions of tenancy he would have with
   him both servitors and companions; and as an experimental beginning he
   sent before him into the glass two dependable negro slaves brought from
   the west indies what his sensations must have been upon beholding this
   first concrete demonstration of his theories only imagination can
   conceive

   undoubtedly a man of his knowledge realized that absence from the
   outside world if deferred beyond the natural span of life of those
   within must mean instant dissolution at the first attempt to return to
   that world but barring that misfortune or accidental breakage those
   within would remain forever as they were at the time of entrance they
   would never grow old and would need neither food nor drink to make
   his prison tolerable he sent ahead of him certain books and writing
   materials a chair and table of stoutest workmanship and a few other
   accessories he knew that the images which the glass would reflect or
   absorb would not be tangible but would merely extend around him like a
   background of dream his own transition in 1687 was a momentous
   experience; and must have been attended by mixed sensations of triumph
   and terror had anything gone wrong there were frightful possibilities
   of being lost in dark and inconceivable multiple dimensions

   for over fifty years he had been unable to secure any additions to the
   little company of himself and slaves but later on he had perfected his
   telepathic method of visualizing small sections of the outside world
   close to the glass and attracting certain individuals in those areas
   through the mirrors strange entrance thus robert influenced into a
   desire to press upon the door had been lured within such
   visualizations depended wholly on telepathy since no one inside the
   mirror could see out into the world of men it was in truth a strange
   life that holm and his company had lived inside the glass since the
   mirror had stood for fully a century with its face to the dusty stone
   wall of the shed where i found it robert was the first being to enter
   this limbo after all that interval his arrival was a gala event for
   he brought news of the outside world which must have been of the most
   startling impressiveness to the more thoughtful of those within he in
   his turnyoung though he wasfelt overwhelmingly the weirdness of
   meeting and talking with persons who had been alive in the seventeenth
   and eighteenth centuries

   the deadly monotony of life for the prisoners can only be vaguely
   conjectured as mentioned its extensive spatial variety was limited to
   localities which had been reflected in the mirror for long periods; and
   many of these had become dim and strange as tropical climates had made
   inroads on the surface certain localities were bright and beautiful
   and in these the company usually gathered but no scene could be fully
   satisfying; since the visible objects were all unreal and intangible
   and often of perplexingly indefinite outline when the tedious periods
   of darkness came the general custom was to indulge in memories
   reflections or conversations each one of that strange pathetic group
   had retained his or her personality unchanged and unchangeable since
   becoming immune to the time effects of outside space the number of
   inanimate objects within the glass aside from the clothing of the
   prisoners was very small; being largely limited to the accessories
   holm had provided for himself the rest did without even furniture
   since sleep and fatigue had vanished along with most other vital
   attributes such inorganic things as were present seemed as exempt
   from decay as the living beings the lower forms of animal life were
   wholly absent

   robert derived most of his information from herr thiele the gentleman
   who spoke english with a scandinavian accent this portly dane had
   taken a fancy to him and talked at considerable length the others
   too had received him with courtesy and goodwill; holm himself seeming
   welldisposed had told him about various matters including the door of
   the trap

   the boy as he told me later was sensible enough never to attempt
   communication with me when holm was nearby twice while thus engaged
   he had seen holm appear; and had accordingly ceased at once at no time
   could i see the world behind the mirrors surface roberts visual
   image which included his bodily form and the clothing connected with
   it waslike the aural image of his halting voice and like his own
   visualization of myselfa case of purely telepathic transmission; and
   did not involve true interdimensional sight however had robert been
   as trained a telepathist as holm he might have transmitted a few
   strong images apart from his immediate person throughout this period
   of revelation i had of course been desperately trying to devise a
   method for roberts release on the fourth daythe ninth after the
   disappearancei hit on a solution everything considered my
   laboriously formulated process was not a very complicated one; though i
   could not tell beforehand how it would work while the possibility of
   ruinous consequences in case of a slip was appalling this process
   depended basically on the fact that there was no possible exit from
   inside the glass if holm and his prisoners were permanently sealed in
   then release must come wholly from outside other considerations
   included the disposal of the other prisoners if any survived and
   especially of axel holm what robert had told me of him was anything
   but reassuring; and i certainly did not wish him loose in my apartment
   free once more to work his evil will upon the world the telepathic
   messages had not made fully clear the effect of liberation on those who
   had entered the glass so long ago

   there was too a final though minor problem in case of successthat
   of getting robert back into the routine of school life without having
   to explain the incredible in case of failure it was highly
   inadvisable to have witnesses present at the release operationsand
   lacking these i simply could not attempt to relate the actual facts if
   i should succeed even to me the reality seemed a mad one whenever i
   let my mind turn from the data so compellingly presented in that tense
   series of dreams

   when i had thought these problems through as far as possible i
   procured a large magnifyingglass from the school laboratory and
   studied minutely every square millimeter of that whorlcenter which
   presumably marked the extent of the original ancient mirror used by
   holm even with this aid i could not quite trace the exact boundary
   between the old area and the surface added by the danish wizard: but
   after a long study decided on a conjectural oval boundary which i
   outlined very precisely with a soft blue pencil i then made a trip to
   stamford where i procured a heavy glasscutting tool; for my primary
   idea was to remove the ancient and magically potent mirror from its
   later setting

   my next step was to figure out the best time of day to make the crucial
   experiment i finally settled on twothirty amboth because it was a
   good season for uninterrupted work and because it was the opposite
   of twothirty pm the probable moment at which robert had entered the
   mirror this form of oppositeness may or may not have been relevant
   but i knew at least that the chosen hour was as good as anyand
   perhaps better than most

   i finally set to work in the early morning of the eleventh day after
   the disappearance having drawn all the shades of my livingroom and
   closed and locked the door into the hallway following with breathless
   care the elliptical line i had traced i worked around the
   whorlsection with my steelwheeled cutting tool the ancient glass
   half an inch thick crackled crisply under the firm uniform pressure;
   and upon completing the circuit i cut around it a second time
   crunching the roller more deeply into the glass

   then very carefully indeed i lifted the heavy mirror down from its
   console and leaned it faceinward against the wall; prying off two of
   the thin narrow boards nailed to the back with equal caution i
   smartly tapped the cutaround space with the heavy wooden handle of the
   glasscutter

   at the very first tap the whorlcontaining section of glass dropped out
   on the bokhara rug beneath i did not know what might happen but was
   keyed up for anything and took a deep involuntary breath i was on my
   knees for convenience at the moment with my face quite near the newly
   made aperture; and as i breathed there poured into my nostrils a
   powerful dusty odora smell not comparable to any other i have ever
   encountered then everything within my range of vision suddenly turned
   to a dull gray before my failing eyesight as i felt myself overpowered
   by an invisible force which robbed my muscles of their power to
   function

   i remember grasping weakly and futilely at the edge of the nearest
   window drapery and feeling it rip loose from its fastening then i sank
   slowly to the floor as the darkness of oblivion passed over me

   when i regained consciousness i was lying on the bokhara rug with my
   legs held unaccountably up in the air the room was full of that
   hideous and inexplicable dusty smelland as my eyes began to take in
   definite images i saw that robert grandison stood in front of me it
   was hefully in the flesh and with his coloring normalwho was
   holding my legs aloft to bring the blood back to my head as the
   schools firstaid course had taught him to do with persons who had
   fainted for a moment i was struck mute by the stifling odor and by a
   bewilderment which quickly merged into a sense of triumph then i found
   myself able to move and speak collectedly

   i raised a tentative hand and waved feebly at robert

   all right old man i murmured you can let my legs down now many
   thanks im all right again i think it was the smelli imaginethat
   got me open that farthest window pleasewidefrom the bottom
   thats itthanks noleave the shade down the way it was i
   struggled to my feet my disturbed circulation adjusting itself in
   waves and stood upright hanging to the back of a big chair i was
   still groggy but a blast of fresh bitterly cold air from the window
   revived me rapidly i sat down in the big chair and looked at robert
   now walking toward me

   first i said hurriedly tell me robertthose othersholm? what
   happened to them when iopened the exit?

   robert paused halfway across the room and looked at me very gravely

   i saw them fade awayinto nothingnessmr canevin he said with
   solemnity; and with themeverything there isnt any more `inside
   sirthank god and you sir!

   and young robert at last yielding to the sustained strain which he had
   borne through all those terrible eleven days suddenly broke down like
   a little child and began to weep hysterically in great stifling dry
   sobs

   i picked him up and placed him gently on my davenport threw a rug over
   him sat down by his side and put a calming hand on his forehead
   take it easy old fellow i said soothingly

   the boys sudden and very natural hysteria passed as quickly as it had
   come on as i talked to him reassuringly about my plans for his quiet
   restoration to the school the interest of the situation and the need
   of concealing the incredible truth beneath a rational explanation took
   hold of his imagination as i had expected; and at last he sat up
   eagerly telling the details of his release and listening to the
   instructions i had thought out he had it seems been in the
   projected area of my bedroom when i opened the way back and had
   emerged in that actual roomhardly realizing that he was out upon
   hearing a fall in the livingroom he had hastened thither finding me
   on the rug in my fainting spell

   i need mention only briefly my method of restoring robert in a
   seemingly normal wayhow i smuggled him out of the window in an old
   hat and sweater of mine took him down the road in my quietly started
   car coached him carefully in a tale i had devised and returned to
   arouse browne with the news of his discovery he had i explained been
   walking alone on the afternoon of his disappearance; and had been
   offered a motor ride by two young men who as a joke and over his
   protests that he could go no farther than stamford and back had begun
   to carry him past that town jumping from the car during a traffic stop
   with the intention of hitchhiking back before callover he had been
   hit by another car just as the traffic was releasedawakening ten days
   later in the greenwich home of the people who had hit him on learning
   the date i added he had immediately telephoned the school; and i
   being the only one awake had answered the call and hurried after him
   in my car without stopping to notify anyone

   browne who at once telephoned to roberts parents accepted my story
   without question; and forbore to interrogate the boy because of the
   latters manifest exhaustion it was arranged that he should remain at
   the school for a rest under the expert care of mrs browne a former
   trained nurse i naturally saw a good deal of him during the remainder
   of the christmas vacation and was thus enabled to fill in certain gaps
   in his fragmentary dreamstory

   now and then we would almost doubt the actuality of what had occurred;
   wondering whether we had not both shared some monstrous delusion born
   of the mirrors glittering hypnotism and whether the tale of the ride
   and accident were not after all the real truth but whenever we did so
   we would be brought back to belief by some monstrous and haunting
   memory; with me of roberts dreamfigure and its thick voice and
   inverted colors; with him of the whole fantastic pageantry of ancient
   people and dead scenes that he had witnessed and then there was that
   joint recollection of that damnable dusty odor    we knew what it
   meant: the instant dissolution of those who had entered an alien
   dimension a century and more ago

   there are in addition at least two lines of rather more positive
   evidence; one of which comes through my researches in danish annals
   concerning the sorcerer axel holm such a person indeed left many
   traces in folklore and written records; and diligent library sessions
   plus conferences with various learned danes have shed much more light
   on his evil fame at present i need say only that the copenhagen
   glassblowerborn in 1612was a notorious luciferian whose pursuits
   and final vanishing formed a matter of awed debate over two centuries
   ago he had burned with a desire to know all things and to conquer
   every limitation of mankindto which end he had delved deeply into
   occult and forbidden fields ever since he was a child

   he was commonly held to have joined a coven of the dreaded witchcult
   and the vast lore of ancient scandinavian mythwith its loki the sly
   one and the accursed fenriswolfwas soon an open book to him he had
   strange interests and objectives few of which were definitely known
   but some of which were recognized as intolerably evil it is recorded
   that his two negro helpers originally slaves from the danish west
   indies had become mute soon after their acquisition by him; and that
   they had disappeared not long before his own disappearance from the ken
   of mankind

   near the close of an already long life the idea of a glass of
   immortality appears to have entered his mind that he had acquired an
   enchanted mirror of inconceivable antiquity was a matter of common
   whispering; it being alleged that he had purloined it from a
   fellowsorcerer who had entrusted it to him for polishing

   this mirroraccording to popular tales a trophy as potent in its way
   as the betterknown aegis of minerva or hammer of thorwas a small
   oval object called lokis glass made of some polished fusible
   mineral and having magical properties which included the divination of
   the immediate future and the power to show the possessor his enemies
   that it had deeper potential properties realizable in the hands of an
   erudite magician none of the common people doubted; and even educated
   persons attached much fearful importance to holms rumored attempts to
   incorporate it in a larger glass of immortality then had come the
   wizards disappearance in 1687 and the final sale and dispersal of his
   goods amidst a growing cloud of fantastic legendry it was altogether
   just such a story as one would laugh at if possessed of no particular
   key; yet to me remembering those dream messages and having robert
   grandisons corroboration before me it formed a positive confirmation
   of all the bewildering marvels that had been unfolded

   but as i have said there is still another line of rather positive
   evidenceof a very different characterat my disposal two days after
   his release as robert greatly improved in strength and appearance
   was placing a log on my livingroom fire i noticed a certain
   awkwardness in his motions and was struck by a persistent idea
   summoning him to my desk i suddenly asked him to pick up an
   inkstandand was scarcely surprised to note that despite lifelong
   righthandedness he obeyed unconsciously with his left hand without
   alarming him i then asked that he unbutton his coat and let me listen
   to his cardiac action what i found upon placing my ear to his
   chestand what i did not tell him for some time afterwardwas that
   his heart was beating on his right side

   he had gone into the glass righthanded and with all organs in their
   normal positions now he was lefthanded and with organs reversed and
   would doubtless continue so for the rest of his life clearly the
   dimensional transition had been no illusionfor this physical change
   was tangible and unmistakable had there been a natural exit from the
   glass robert would probably have undergone a thorough rereversal and
   emerged in perfect normalityas indeed the colorscheme of his body
   and clothing did emerge the forcible nature of his release however
   undoubtedly set something awry; so that dimensions no longer had a
   chance to right themselves as chromatic wavefrequencies still did

   i had not merely opened holms trap; i had destroyed it; and at the
   particular stage of destruction marked by roberts escape some of the
   reversing properties had perished it is significant that in escaping
   robert had felt no pain comparable to that experienced in entering had
   the destruction been still more sudden i shiver to think of the
   monstrosities of color the boy would always have been forced to bear i
   may add that after discovering roberts reversal i examined the rumpled
   and discarded clothing he had worn in the glass and found as i had
   expected a complete reversal of pockets buttons and all other
   corresponding details

   at this moment lokis glass just as it fell on my bokhara rug from the
   now patched and harmless mirror weighs down a sheaf of papers on my
   writingtable here in st thomas venerable capital of the danish west
   indiesnow the american virgin islands various collectors of old
   sandwich glass have mistaken it for an odd bit of that early american
   productbut i privately realize that my paperweight is an antique of
   far subtler and more paleogean craftsmanship still i do not
   disillusion such enthusiasts

   8529the treeh p lovecraft

   on a verdant slope of mount maenalus in arcadia there stands an olive
   grove about the ruins of a villa close by is a tomb once beautiful
   with the sublimest sculptures but now fallen into as great decay as
   the house at one end of that tomb its curious roots displacing the
   timestained blocks of pentelic marble grows an unnaturally large
   olive tree of oddly repellent shape; so like to some grotesque man or
   deathdistorted body of a man that the country folk fear to pass it at
   night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs mount
   maenalus is a chosen haunt of dreaded pan whose queer companions are
   many and simple swains believe that the tree must have some hideous
   kinship to these weird panisci; but an old beekeeper who lives in the
   neighboring cottage told me a different story

   many years ago when the hillside villa was new and resplendent there
   dwelt within it the two sculptors kalos and musides from lydia to
   neapolis the beauty of their work was praised and none dared say that
   the one excelled the other in skill the hermes of kalos stood in a
   marble shrine in corinth and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar
   in athens near the parthenon all men paid homage to kalos and musides
   and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of
   their brotherly friendship

   but though kalos and musides dwelt in unbroken harmony their natures
   were not alike whilst musides revelled by night amidst the urban
   gaieties of tegea kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the
   sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove there he
   would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind and there devise
   the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble
   idle folk indeed said that kalos conversed with the spirits of the
   grove and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he
   met there for he patterned his work after no living model

   so famous were kalos and musides that none wondered when the tyrant of
   syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of tyche
   which he had planned for his city of great size and cunning
   workmanship must the statue be for it was to form a wonder of nations
   and a goal of travellers exalted beyond thought would be he whose work
   should gain acceptance and for this honor kalos and musides were
   invited to compete their brotherly love was well known and the crafty
   tyrant surmised that each instead of concealing his work from the
   other would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of
   unheard of beauty the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams
   of poets

   with joy the sculptors hailed the tyrants offer so that in the days
   that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels not
   from each other did kalos and musides conceal their work but the sight
   was for them alone saving theirs no eyes beheld the two divine
   figures released by skillful blows from the rough blocks that had
   imprisoned them since the world began

   at night as of yore musides sought the banquet halls of tegea whilst
   kalos wandered alone in the olive grove but as time passed men
   observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling musides it was
   strange they said amongst themselves that depression should thus seize
   one with so great a chance to win arts loftiest reward many months
   passed yet in the sour face of musides came nothing of the sharp
   expectancy which the situation should arouse

   then one day musides spoke of the illness of kalos after which none
   marvelled again at his sadness since the sculptors attachment was
   known to be deep and sacred subsequently many went to visit kalos and
   indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy
   serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of musides
   who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the
   slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own
   hands hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of
   tyche little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful
   attendant

   as kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations
   of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend he desired to be
   carried often to the grove which he so loved there he would ask to be
   left alone as if wishing to speak with unseen things musides ever
   granted his requests though his eyes filled with visible tears at the
   thought that kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than
   for him at last the end drew near and kalos discoursed of things
   beyond this life musides weeping promised him a sepulchre more
   lovely than the tomb of mausolus; but kalos bade him speak no more of
   marble glories only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man;
   that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his
   resting placeclose to his head and one night sitting alone in the
   darkness of the olive grove kalos died beautiful beyond words was the
   marble sepulchre which stricken musides carved for his beloved friend
   none but kalos himself could have fashioned such basreliefs wherein
   were displayed all the splendours of elysium nor did musides fail to
   bury close to kalos head the olive twigs from the grove

   as the first violence of musides grief gave place to resignation he
   labored with diligence upon his figure of tyche all honour was now
   his since the tyrant of syracuse would have the work of none save him
   or kalos his task proved a vent for his emotion and he toiled more
   steadily each day shunning the gaieties he once had relished
   meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend where
   a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleepers head so swift was
   the growth of this tree and so strange was its form that all who
   beheld it exclaimed in surprise; and musides seemed at once fascinated
   and repelled

   three years after the death of kalos musides despatched a messenger to
   the tyrant and it was whispered in the agora at tegea that the mighty
   statue was finished by this time the tree by the tomb had attained
   amazing proportions exceeding all other trees of its kind and sending
   out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which musides
   labored as many visitors came to view the prodigious tree as to
   admire the art of the sculptor so that musides was seldom alone but
   he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed he seemed to dread
   being alone now that his absorbing work was done the bleak mountain
   wind sighing through the olive grove and the tombtree had an uncanny
   way of forming vaguely articulate sounds

   the sky was dark on the evening that the tyrants emissaries came to
   tegea it was definitely known that they had come to bear away the
   great image of tyche and bring eternal honour to musides so their
   reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth as the night wore on a
   violent storm of wind broke over the crest of maenalus and the men
   from far syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town they
   talked of their illustrious tyrant and of the splendour of his capital
   and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for
   him and then the men of tegea spoke of the goodness of musides and of
   his heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of
   art could console him in the absence of kalos who might have worn
   those laurels instead of the tree which grew by the tomb near the
   head of kalos they also spoke the wind shrieked more horribly and
   both the syracusans and the arcadians prayed to aiolos

   in the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrants messengers
   up the slope to the abode of the sculptor but the night wind had done
   strange things slaves cries ascended from a scene of desolation and
   no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that
   vast hall wherein musides had dreamed and toiled lone and shaken
   mourned the humble courts and the lower walls for upon the sumptuous
   greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of
   the strange new tree reducing the stately poem in marble with odd
   completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins strangers and tegeans stood
   aghast looking from the wreckage to the great sinister tree whose
   aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the
   sculptured sepulchre of kalos and their fear and dismay increased when
   they searched the fallen apartment for of the gentle musides and of
   the marvellously fashioned image of tyche no trace could be
   discovered amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt and the
   representatives of two cities left disappointed; syracusans that they
   had no statue to bear home tegeans that they had no artist to crown
   however the syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue
   in athens and the tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora
   a marble temple commemorating the gifts virtues and brotherly piety
   of musides

   but the olive grove still stands as does the tree growing out of the
   tomb of kalos and the old beekeeper told me that sometimes the boughs
   whisper to one another in the night wind saying over and over again
   oida! oida! i know! i know!

i[edit]

   southeast of hampden near the tortuous salmon river gorge is a range
   of steep rocky hills which have defied all efforts of sturdy
   homesteaders the canyons are too deep and the slopes too precipitous
   to encourage anything save seasonal livestock grazing the last time i
   visited hampden the regionknown as hells acreswas part of the blue
   mountain forest reserve there are no roads linking this inaccessible
   locality with the outside world and the hillfolk will tell you that it
   is indeed a spot transplanted from his satanic majestys front yard
   there is a local superstition that the area is hauntedbut by what or
   by whom no one seems to know natives will not venture within its
   mysterious depths for they believe the stories handed down to them by
   the nez perce indians who have shunned the region for untold
   generations because according to them it is a playground of certain
   giant devils from the outside these suggestive tales made me very
   curious

   my first excursionand my last thank god!into those hills occurred
   while constantine theunis and i were living in hampden the summer of
   1938 he was writing a treatise on egyptian mythology and i found
   myself alone much of the time despite the fact that we shared a modest
   cabin on beacon street within sight of the infamous pirate house
   built by exer jones over sixty years ago

   the morning of june 23rd found me walking in those oddly shaped hills
   which had since seven oclock seemed very ordinary indeed i must
   have been about seven miles north of hampden before i noticed anything
   unusual i was climbing a grassy ridge overlooking a particularly deep
   canyon when i cam upon an area totally devoid of the usual bunchgrass
   and greaseweed it extended southward over numerous hills and valleys
   at first i thought the spot had been burned over the previous fall but
   upon examining the turf i found no signs of a blaze the nearby slopes
   and ravines looked terribly scarred and seared as if some gigantic
   torch had blasted them wiping away all vegetation and yet there was
   no evidence of fire

   i moved on over rich black soil in which no grass flourished as i
   headed for the approximate center of this desolate area i began to
   notice a strange silence there were no larks no rabbits and even the
   insects seemed to have deserted the place i gained the summit of a
   lofty knoll and tried to guess at the size of that bleak inexplicable
   region then i saw the lone tree

   it stood on a hill somewhat higher than its companions and attracted
   the eye because it was so utterly unexpected i had seen no trees for
   miles: thorn and hackberry bushes clustered the shallower ravines but
   there had been no mature trees strange to find one standing on the
   crest of the hill

   i crossed two steep canyons before i came to it; and a surprise awaited
   me it was not a pine tree nor a fir tree nor a hackberry tree i had
   never in all my life seen one to compare with itand i never have to
   this day for which i am eternally thankful!

   more than anything it resembled an oak it had a huge twisted trunk
   fully a yard in diameter and the large limbs began spreading outward
   scarcely seven feet from the ground the leaves were round and
   curiously alike in size and design it might have been a tree painted
   on a canvas but i will swear that it was real i shall always know
   that it was real despite what theunis said later

   i recall that i glanced at the sun and judged the time to be about ten
   oclock am although i did not look at my watch the day was becoming
   warm and i sat for a while in the welcome shade of the huge tree then
   i regarded the rank grass that flourished beneath itanother singular
   phenomenon when i remembered the bleak terrain through which i had
   passed a wild maze of hills ravines and bluffs hemmed me in on all
   sides although the rise on which i sat was rather higher than any
   other within miles i looked far to the eastand i jumped to my feet
   startled and amazed shimmering though a blue haze of distance were the
   bitterroot mountains! there is no other range of snowcapped peaks
   within three hundred miles of hampden; and i knewat this
   altitudethat i shouldnt be seeing them at all for several minutes i
   gazed at the marvel; then i became drowsy i lay in the rank grass
   beneath the tree i unstrapped my camera took off my hat and relaxed
   staring skyward through the green leaves i closed my eyes

   then a curious phenomenon began to assail mea vague cloudy sort of
   visionglimpsing or daydreaming seemingly without relevance to
   anything familiar i thought i saw a great temple by a sea of ooze
   where three suns gleamed in a pale red sky the vast tomb or temple
   was an anomalous colora nameless blueviolet shade large beasts flew
   in the cloudy sky and i seemed to hear the pounding of their scaly
   wings i went nearer the stone temple and a huge doorway loomed in
   front of me within that portal were swirling shadows that seemed to
   dart and leer and try to snatch me inside that awful darkness i
   thought i saw three flaming eyes in the shifting void of a doorway and
   i screamed with mortal fear in that noisome depth i knew lurked
   utter destructiona living hell even worse than death i screamed
   again the vision faded

   i saw the round leaves and the sane earthly sky i struggled to rise i
   was trembling; cold perspiration beaded my brow i had a mad impulse to
   flee; run insanely from that sinister tree on the hillbut i checked
   the absurd intuition and sat down trying to collect my senses never
   had i dreamed anything so realistic; so horrifying what had caused the
   vision? i had been reading several of theunis tomes on ancient
   egypti mopped my forehead and decided that it was time for lunch
   but i did not feel like eating

   then i had an inspiration i would take a few snapshots of the tree
   for theunis they might shock him out of his habitual air of unconcern
   perhaps i would tell him about the dreamopening my camera i took
   half a dozen shots of the tree also i included one of the gleaming
   snowcrested peaks i might want to return and these photos would
   help

   folding the camera i returned to my cushion of soft grass had that
   spot beneath the tree a certain alien enchantment? i know that i was
   reluctant to leave it

   i gazed upward at the curious round leaves i closed my eyes a breeze
   stirred the branches and their whispered music lulled me into tranquil
   oblivion and suddenly i saw again the pale red sky and the three suns
   the land of three shadows! again the great temple came into view i
   seemed to be floating on the aira disembodied spirit exploring the
   wonders of a mad multidimensional world! the temples oddly angled
   cornices frightened me and i knew that this place was one that no man
   on earth had ever seen in his wildest dreams

   again the vast doorway yawned before me; and i was sucked within that
   black writing cloud i seemed to be staring at space unlimited i saw
   a void beyond my vocabulary to describe; a dark bottomless gulf
   teeming with nameless shapes and entitiesthings of madness and
   delirium as tenuous as a mist from shamballah

   my soul shrank i was terribly afraid i screamed and screamed and
   felt that i would soon go mad then in my dream i ran and ran in a
   fever of utter terror but i did not know what i was running fromi
   left that hideous temple and that hellish void yet i knew i must
   barring some miracle return

   at last my eyes flew open i was not beneath the tree i was sprawled
   on a rocky slope my clothing torn and disordered my hands were
   bleeding i stood up pain stabbing through me i recognized the
   spotthe ridge where i had first seen the blasted area! i must have
   walked milesunconscious! the tree was not in sight and i was
   gladeven the knees of my trousers were torn as if i had crawled
   part of the way

   i glanced at the sun late afternoon! where had i been? i snatched out
   my watch it had stopped at 10:34

ii[edit]

   so you have the snapshots? theunis drawled i met his gray eyes
   across the breakfast table three days had slipped by since my return
   from hells acres i had told him about the dream beneath the tree and
   he had laughed

   yes i replied they came last night havent had a chance to open
   them yet give em a good careful studyif they arent all failures
   perhaps youll change your mind

   theunis smiled; sipped his coffee i gave him the unopened envelope and
   he quickly broke the seal and withdrew the pictures he glanced at the
   first one and the smile faded from his leonine face he crushed out
   his cigarette

   my god man! look at this!

   i seized the glossy rectangle it was the first picture of the tree
   taken at a distance of fifty feet or so the cause of theunis
   excitement escaped me there it was standing boldly on the hill while
   below it grew the jungle of grass where i had lain in the distance
   were my snowcapped mountains!

   there you are i cried the proof of my story

   look at it! theunis snapped the shadowsthere are three for every
   rock bush and tree!

   he was rightbelow the tree spread in fanlike incongruity lay three
   overlapping shadows suddenly i realized that the picture held an
   abnormal and inconsistent element the leaves on the thing were too
   lush for the work of sane nature while the trunk was bulged and
   knotted in the most abhorrent shapes theunis dropped the picture on
   the table

   there is something wrong i muttered the tree i saw didnt look as
   repulsive as that

   are you sure? theunis grated the fact is you may have seen many
   things not recorded on this film

   it shows more than i saw!

   thats the point there is something damnably out of place in this
   landscape; something i cant understand the tree seems to suggest a
   thoughtbeyond my graspit is too misty; too uncertain; too unreal
   to be natural! he rapped nervous fingers on the table he snatched the
   remaining films and shuffled through them rapidly

   i reached for the snapshot he had dropped and sensed a touch of
   bizarre uncertainty and strangeness as my eyes absorbed its every
   detail the flowers and weeds pointed at varying angles while some of
   the grass grew in the most bewildering fashion the tree seemed too
   veiled and clouded to be readily distinguished but i noted the huge
   limbs and the halfbent flower stems that were ready to fall over yet
   did not fall and the many overlapping shadowsthey were
   altogether very disquieting shadowstoo long or short when compared
   to the stems they fell below to give one a feeling of comfortable
   normality the landscape hadnt shocked me the day of my visitthere
   was a dark familiarity and mocking suggestion of it; something
   tangible yet distant as the stars beyond the galaxy

   theunis came back to earth did you mention three suns in your
   dreaming orgy?

   i nodded frankly puzzled then it dawned on me my fingers trembled
   slightly as i stared at the picture again my dream! of course

   the others are just like it theunis said that same uncertainness;
   that suggestion i should be able to catch the mood of the thing; see
   it in its real light but it is tooperhaps later i shall find out
   if i look at it long enough

   we sat in silence for some time a thought came to me suddenly
   prompted by a strange inexplicable longing to visit the tree again
   lets make an excursion i think i can take you there in half a day

   youd better stay away replied theunis thoughtfully i doubt if
   you could find the place again if you wanted to

   nonsense i replied surely with these photos to guide us

   do you see any familiar landmarks in them?

   his observation was uncanny after looking through the remaining snaps
   carefully i had to admit that there were none

   theunis muttered under his breath and drew viciously on his cigarette
   a perfectly normalor nearly sopicture of a spot apparently dropped
   from nowhere seeing mountains at this low altitude is
   preposterousbut wait!

   he sprang from the chair as a hunted animal and raced from the room i
   could hear him moving about in our makeshift library cursing volubly
   before long he reappeared with an old leatherbound volume theunis
   opened it reverently and peered over the odd characters

   what do you call that? i inquired

   this is an early english translation of the chronicle of nath written
   by rudolf yergler a german mystic and alchemist who borrowed some of
   his lore from hermes trismegistus the ancient egyptian sorcerer there
   is a passage here that might interest youmight make you understand
   why this business is even further from the natural than you suspect
   listen
so in the year of the black goat there came unto nath a shadow that should not
be on
earth and that had no form known to the eyes of earth and it fed on the souls
of men;
they that it gnawed being lured and blinded with dreams till the horror and the
endless
night lay upon them nor did they see that which gnawed them; for the shadow too
k false
shapes that men know or dream of and only freedom seemed waiting in the land of
 the
three suns but it was told by priests of the old book that he who could see the
shadows true shape and live after the seeing might shun its doom and send it
back to
the starless gulf of its spawning this none could do save through the gem; wher
efore did
kanefer the highpriest keep that gem sacred in the temple and when it was los
t with
phrenes he who braved the horror and was never seen more there was weeping in
nath yet
did the shadow depart sated at last nor shall it hunger again till the cycles r
oll back
to the year of the black goat

   theunis paused while i stared bewildered finally he spoke now
   single i suppose you can guess how this all links up there is no need
   of going deep into the primal lore behind this business but i may as
   well tell you that according to the old legends this is the socalled
   year of the black goatwhen certain horrors from the fathomless
   outside are supposed to visit the earth and do infinite harm we dont
   know how theyll be manifest but theres reason to think that strange
   mirages and hallucinations will be mixed up in the matter i dont like
   the thing youve run up againstthe story or the pictures it may be
   pretty bad and i warn you to look out but first i must try to do what
   old yergler saysto see if i can glimpse the matter as it is
   fortunately the old gem he mentions has been rediscoveredi know where
   i can get at it we must use it on the photograph and see what we see

   its more or less like a lens or prism though one cant take
   photographs with it someone of peculiar sensitiveness might look
   through and sketch what he sees theres a bit of danger and the
   looker may have his consciousness shaken a trifle; for the real shape
   of the shadow isnt pleasant and doesnt belong on this earth but it
   would be a lot more dangerous not to do anything about it meanwhile
   if you value your life and your sanity keep away from that hilland
   from the thing you think is a tree on it

   i was more bewildered than ever how can there be organized beings
   from the outside in our midst? i cried how do we know that such
   things exist?

   you reason in terms of this tiny earth theunis said surely you
   dont think that the world is a rule for measuring the universe there
   are entities we never dream of floating under our very noses modern
   science is thrusting back the borderland of the unknown and proving
   that the mystics were not so far off the track

   suddenly i knew i did not want to look at the picture again; i wanted
   to destroy it i wanted to run from it theunis was suggesting
   something beyonda trembling cosmic fear gripped me and drew me away
   from the hideous picture for i was afraid i would recognize some
   object in it

   i glanced at my friend he was poring over the ancient book a strange
   expression on his face he sat up straight lets call the thing off
   for today im tired of this endless guessing and wondering i must get
   the loan of the gem from the museum where it is and do what is to be
   done

   as you say i replied will you have to go to croydon?

   he nodded

   then well both go home i said decisively

iii[edit]

   i need not chronicle the events of the fortnight that followed with me
   they formed a constant and enervating struggle between a mad longing to
   return to the cryptic tree of dreams and freedom and a frenzied dread
   of that selfsame thing and all connected with it that i did not return
   is perhaps less a matter of my own will than a matter of pure chance
   meanwhile i knew that theunis was desperately active in some
   investigation of the strangest naturesomething which included a
   mysterious motor trip and a return under circumstances of the greatest
   secrecy by hints over the telephone i was made to understand that he
   had somewhere borrowed the obscure and primal object mentioned in the
   ancient volume as the gem and that he was busy devising a means of
   applying it to the photographs i had left with him he spoke
   fragmentarily of refraction polarization and unknown angles of
   space and time and indicated that he was building a kind of box or
   camera obscura for the study of the curious snapshots with the gems
   aid

   it was on the sixteenth day that i received the startling message from
   the hospital in croydon theunis was there and wanted to see me at
   once he had suffered some odd sort of seizure; being found prone and
   unconscious by friends who found their way into his house after hearing
   certain cries of mortal agony and fear though still weak and helpless
   he had now regained his senses and seemed frantic to tell me something
   and have me perform certain important duties this much the hospital
   informed me over the wire; and within half an hour i was at my friends
   bedside marveling at the inroads which worry and tension had made on
   his features in so brief a time his first act was to move away the
   nurses in order to speak in utter confidence

   singlei saw it! his voice was strained and husky you must destroy
   them allthose pictures i sent it back by seeing it but the pictures
   had better go that tree will never be seen on the hill againat
   least i hope nottill thousands of eons bring back the year of the
   black goat you are safe nowmankind is safe he paused breathing
   heavily and continued

   take the gem out of the apparatus and put it in the safeyou know the
   combination it must go back where it came from for theres a time
   when it may be needed to save the world they wont let me leave here
   yet but i can rest if i know its safe dont look through the box as
   it isit would fix you as its fixed me and burn those damned
   photographsthe one in the box and the others but theunis was
   exhausted now and the nurses advanced and motioned me away as he
   leaned back and closed his eyes

   in another halfhour i was at his house and looking curiously at the
   long black box on the library table beside the overturned chair
   scattered papers blew about in a breeze from the open window and close
   to the box i recognized with a queer sensation the envelope of pictures
   i had taken it required only a moment for me to examine the box and
   detach at one end my earliest picture of the tree and at the other end
   a strange bit of ambercolored crystal cut in devious angles
   impossible to classify the touch of the glass fragment seemed
   curiously warm and electric and i could scarcely bear to put it out of
   sight in theunis wall safe the snapshot i handled with a
   disconcerting mixture of emotions even after i had replaced it in the
   envelope with the rest i had a morbid longing to save it and gloat over
   it and rush out and up the hill toward its original peculiar
   linearrangements sprang out of its details to assault and puzzle my
   memorypictures behind picturessecrets lurking in halffamiliar
   shapesbut a saner contrary instinct operating at the same time
   gave me the vigor and avidity of unplaceable fear as i hastily kindled
   a fire in the grate and watched the problematic envelope burn to ashes
   somehow i felt that the earth had been purged of a horror on whose
   brink i had trembled and which was none the less monstrous because i
   did not know what it was

   of the source of theunis terrific shock i could form no coherent
   guess nor did i dare to think too closely about it it is notable that
   i did not at any time have the least impulse to look through the box
   before removing the gem and photograph what was shown in the picture
   by the antique crystals lens or prismlike power was not i felt
   curiously certain anything that a normal brain ought to be called upon
   to face whatever it was i had myself been close to ithad been
   completely under the spell of its allurementas it brooded on that
   remote hill in the form of a tree and an unfamiliar landscape and i
   did not wish to know what i had so narrowly escaped

   would that my ignorance might have remained complete! i could sleep
   better at night as it was my eye was arrested before i left the room
   by the pile of scattered papers rustling on the table beside the black
   box all but one were blank but that one bore a crude drawing in
   pencil suddenly recalling what theunis had once said about sketching
   the horror revealed by the gem i strove to turn away; but sheer
   curiosity defeated my sane design looking again almost furtively i
   observed the nervous haste of the stroke and the unfinished edge left
   by the sketchers terrified seizure then in a burst of perverse
   boldness i looked squarely at the dark and forbidden designand fell
   in a faint

   i shall never describe fully what i saw after a time i regained my
   senses thrust the sheet into the dying fire and staggered out through
   the quiet streets to my home i thanked god that i had not looked
   through the crystal at the photograph and prayed fervently that i
   might forget the drawings terrible hint of what theunis had beheld
   since then i have never been quite the same even the fairest scenes
   have seemed to hold some vague ambiguous hint of the nameless
   blasphemies which may underlie them and form their masquerading
   essence and yet the sketch was so slightso little indicative of all
   that theunis to judge from his guarded accounts later on must have
   discerned!

   only a few basic elements of the landscape were in the thing for the
   most part a cloudy exoticlooking vapor dominated the view every
   object that might have been familiar was seen to be part of something
   vague and unknown and altogether unterrestrialsomething infinitely
   vaster than any human eye could grasp and infinitely alien monstrous
   and hideous as guessed from the fragment within range

   where i had in the landscape itself seen the twisted halfsentient
   tree there was here visible only a gnarled terrible hand or talon
   with fingers or feelers shockingly distended and evidently groping
   toward something on the ground or in the spectators direction and
   squarely below the writhing bloated digits i thought i saw an outline
   in the grass where a man had lain but the sketch was hasty and i
   could not be sure

   the great remembrance

   read at the annual reunion of the society of the army of the potomac
   faneuil hall boston june 27 1893

   comrades the circle narrows heads grow white
   as once more by the campfires flaring light
   we gather and clasp hands as we have done
   these many many years so long ago
   a part we were of all that glorious show
   stood side by side neath the red battlesun
   so long ago we breathed wars thunderous breath
   knew the white fury of that lifeindeath
   so long ago that troubled joy it seems
   the valorous pageant might resolve to splendid dreams
    but no! too deep t is burned into the brain!
   as well were lightningscar by summer rain
   washed clean away when stroke on blinding stroke
   hath torn the rock and riven the blackened oak
    how oft as down these peaceful streets we pass
   all vanishes save lo! the rutted grass
   wreckt caissons frightened beasts and merciful god!
   the piteous burden of the ensanguined sod!
    yet not all terror doth the memory save
   from wars emblazonry and open grave:
   in glimpses flashing like a meteors light
   a silent army marches through the night;
   the guidons flutter in a golden valley
   where at the noonday halt the horsemen dally;
   or look! a thousand tents gleam through the black;
   or now where quickbuilt campfires flame and crack
   from blaze to shade men stretch oerwearied limbs
   chant songs or wake the hills with chorused hymns;
   or ere the dawn makes pale the starry dark
   the fiery signals spark on trailing spark
   write on the silent sky their still command
   while the great army moves drawn by a single hand

    so long ago it seems so long ago
   behold our sons grown men since those great days
   born since the last clear bugle ceased to blow
   its summons down the valley; since the bays
   shook with the roar of fort and answering fleet
   our very children look into our eyes
   and find strange records with a mute surprise;
   as they some curious traveler might greet
   who kept far countries in his musing mind
   beyond the weltering seas the mountainwalls behind
    and yet it was this land and not another
   where blazed wars flame and rolled the battlecloud
   in all this land there was no home where brother
   father or son hurried not forth; where bowed
   no brokenhearted woman when pale death
   laid his cold finger on the loved ones breath

    like to a drama did the scene unroll
   some dark majestic drama of the soul
   wherein all strove as actors hour by hour
   yet breathless watched the whole swift tragic play
   faithful did each his little part essay
   urged to an end unknown by one allknowing power;
   while if the drama pauses now and then
   on the huge stage t is for a moment only
   here at the heart or in some vista lonely
   a single hero or a million men
   and with the tragic theme the world resounds again
    first in the awful waiting came the shock
   the shame unbearable the sacred flag assailed
   assailed in freedoms name by those who freedom mock!
   ah then the oath to stand as stands the rock
   gainst flood and tempest lest that flag be trailed
   and torn or any star therefrom be lost
   the oath murmured alone or where the crowd
   as by a wind of heaven swept and tost
   passioned its soul to god and strong men wept aloud
    then sweet farewell; o bittersweet farewell;
   o brave farewell! who were the bravest then
   or they who went or waitedwomen or men?
   they who the cheers heard or the funeral knell?
   they who stept proudly to the rattling drum
   inflamed by wars divine delirium
   or they who knew no mad joy of the fight
   and yet breathed on through waiting day and weeping night?

    farewell and forward! o to live it over
   the first wild heartbeat of heroic hours!
   forward like mountaintorrents after showers!
   forward to death as to his bride the lover!
   forward till quick recoils the impetuous flood
   and ends the first dread scene in terror and in blood!
    onward once more through sun and shivering storm
   a monstrous length with wavering bulk enorm
   wounded or striking bringing blood or bleeding
   onward still on the agony unheeding!
   onward with failing heart or courage high!
   onward through heat and hunger and dismay
   turning the starry night to murderous day!
   onward with hope appalled once more to strike and die!

    so marched so fought so agonized the hosts;
   battling through forests; rotting where slow crawls
   the deathly swampstream; and like pallid ghosts
   haunting the hospitals and loathèd prisonwalls
   they knew what freedom was and right to breathe
   clean air who burrowed from the filth and seethe
   of foulest pens only that dogs might track
   and to the deathpit drag their living corpses back
    o would to heaven some sights could fade from out
   clear memorys all too melancholy page
   fade and be gone forever! let the shout
   of victory only linger and the rage
   and glory of battle over land and sea
   and all that noblest is in wars fierce pageantry
    echoes of deeds immortal o awake!
   tremble to language into music break
   till lyric memory takes the old emotion
   and leaps from heart to heart the ancient thrill!
   tell of great deeds that yet the wide earth fill:
   how first upon the amazèd waves of ocean
   the black infernal deadly armoredships
   together rushed and all the world stood still
   while a new word of war burst from those iron lips;
   how up the rivers thundered the strong fleets;
   how the great captains gainst each other dashed
   gigantic armies what wild welcome meets
   some wellloved chief who ere those armies clashed
   rides like a whirlwind the embattled line
   kindling the stricken ranks to bravery divine!
   and hark at set of sun the cheer that greets
   victorious news from faroff armies flashed
   from camp to camp with roar on answering roar
   like bellowing waves that track the tempest down the shore
    but chiefly tell of that one hour of all
   when threatening war rolled highest its full tide
   even to the perilous northern mountainside
   where heaven should bid our good cause rise or fall
   tell of that hour for never in all the world
   was braver army gainst a braver hurled
   to both the victory all unawares
   beyond all dreams of losing or of winning;
   for the new land which now is ours and theirs
   had on that topmost day its glorious beginning
   they who charged up that drenched and desperate slope
   were heroes alland looked in heroes eyes!
   ah! heroes never heroes did despise!
   that day had strife its bloodiest bourn and scope;
   above the shaken hills and sulphurous skies
   peace lifted up her mournful head and smiled on hope

    rushed the great drama on its tragic way
   swift to the happy end from that tremendous day
   happy indeed could memory lose her power
   and yield to joy alone the glad triumphant hour;
   happy if every aching heart could shun
   remembrance of the unreturning one;
   if at the grand review when mile on mile
   and day on day the marching columns past
   darkened not oer the world the shadow vast
   of his foul murderhe the free from guile
   sadhearted loving and beloved and wise
   who ruled with sinewy hands and dreaming eyes
   what soul that lived then who remembers not
   the hour the landscape ah! the very spot
   hateful for ayewhere news that he was slain
   struck like a hammer on the dazèd brain!

    so long ago it was so long ago
   all all have past; the terror and the splendor
   have turned like yesterevenings stormy glow
   into a sunset memory strange and tender
   how beautiful it seems what lordly sights
   what deeds sublime what wondrous days and nights
   what love of comrades ay what quickened breath
   when first we knew that startled quailing still
   we too even we along the blazing hill
   we with the best could face and conquer death!

    glorious all these but these all less than naught
   to the one passion of those days divine
   love of the land our own hearts blood had bought
   our country our own country yours and mine
   then known then sternly loved first in our lives
   ah! loved we not our children sisters wives?
   but our own country this was more than they
   our wives our children thisour hope our love
   for all most dear but morethe dawning day
   of freedom for the world the hope above
   all hope for the sad race of man for where
   in what more lovely world neath skies more fair
   if freedom here should fail could it find soil and air?
    in this one thought one passionwhateer fate
   still may befallone moment we were great!
   one moment in lifes brief perplexèd hour
   we climbed the hight of being and the power
   that falls alone on those who love their kind
   a moment made us one with the eternal mind

    one moment ah! not so dear country! thou
   art still our passion; still to thee we bow
   in love supreme! fairer than eer before
   art thou today from golden shore to shore
   the home of freemen not one stain doth cling
   now to thy banner argosies of war
   on thy imperial rivers bravely fling
   flags of the nations but no message bring
   save of peace only; while behold from far
   the old world comes to greet thy natal star
   that with the circling century returns
   and in the western heavens with fourfold beauty burns

    land that we love! thou future of the world!
   thou refuge of the noble heart opprest!
   o never be thy shining image hurled
   from its high place in the adoring breast
   of him who worships thee with jealous love!
   keep thou thy starry forehead as the dove
   all white and to the eternal dawn inclined!
   thou art not for thyself but for mankind
   and to despair of thee were to despair
   of man of mans high destiny of god!
   of thee should man despair the journey trod
   upward through unknown eons stair on stair
   by this our race with bleeding feet and slow
   were but the pathway to a darker woe
   than yet was visioned by the heavy heart
   of prophet to despair of thee! ah no!
   for thou thyself art hope hope of the world thou art!

   comrades belovèd see the fire burns low
   and darkness thickens soon shall our brief part
   on earth forever end and we shall go
   to join the unseen ranks; nor will we swerve
   or fear when to the silent great reserve
   at last we orderedare as one by one
   our captains have been called their labors done
   to rest and wait in the celestial field
   ay year by year we to the dead did yield
   our bravest them we followed to the tomb
   sorrowing; for they were worthy of our love
   highsouled and generous loving peace above
   war and its glories: therefore lives no gloom
   in this our sorrow; rather pride and praise
   and gratitude and memory of old days
    a little while and these tired hands will cease
   to lift obedient or in war or peace
   faithful we trust in peace as once in war;
   and on the scroll of peace some triumphs are
   noble as battles won; tho less resounds
   the fame as deep and bitter are the wounds
    but now the fire burns low and we must sleep
   erelong while other eyes than ours the vigil keep
   and after we are gone to other eyes
   that watch below shall come in starry skies
   a fairer dawn whereon in fiery light
   the eternal captain shall his signals write;
   and shaken from rest and gazing at that sign
   on shall the mighty nation move led by a hand divine

   the white city

   (the columbian exposition)

   i

   greece was; greece is no more
   temple and town
   have crumbled down;
   time is the fire that hath consumed them all
   statue and wall
   in ruin strew the universal floor

   ii

   greece lives but greece no more!
   its ashes breed
   the undying seed
   blown westward till in romes imperial towers
   athens reflowers;
   still westwardlo a veiled and virgin shore!

   iii

   say not greece is no more
   through the clear morn
   on light winds borne
   her whitewinged soul sinks on the new worlds breast
   ah! happy west
   greece flowers anew and all her temples soar!

   iv

   one bright hour then no more
   shall to the skies
   these columns rise
   but tho arts flower shall fade again the seed
   onward shall speed
   quickening the land from lake to oceans roar

   v

   art lives tho greece may never
   from the ancient mold
   as once of old
   exhale to heaven the inimitable bloom;
   yet from that tomb
   beauty walks forth to light the world forever!

   the vanishing city

   i

   enraptured memory and all ye powers of being
    to new life waken! stamp the vision clear
   on the souls inmost substance o let seeing
    be more than seeing; let the entrancèd ear
   take deep these surging sounds inweaved with light
    of unimagined radiance; let the intense
   illumined loveliness that thrills the night
    strike in the human heart some deeper sense!
   so shall these domes that meet heavens curvèd blue
    and yon long white imperial colonnade
   and manycolumned peristyle endue
    the mind with beauty that shall never fade;
   tho all too soon to dark oblivion wending
   reared in one happy hour to know as swift an ending

   ii

   thou shalt of all the cities of the world
    famed for their grandeur evermore endure
   imperishably and all alone impearled
    in the worlds living thought the one most sure
   of love undying and of endless praise
    for beauty onlychief of all thy kind;
   immortal even because of thy brief days;
    thou cloudbuilt fairy city of the mind!
   here man doth pluck from the full tree of life
    the latest lordliest flower of earthly art;
   this doth he breathe while resting from his strife
    this presses he against his weary heart;
   then wakening from his dream within a dream
   he flings the faded flower on times downrushing stream

   iii

   o never as here in the eternal years
    hath burst to bloom mans free and soaring spirit
   joyous untrammeled all untouched by tears
    and the dark weight of woe it doth inherit
   never so swift the minds imaginings
    caught sculptured form and color never before
   save where the soul beats unembodied wings
    gainst viewless skieswas such enchanted shore
   jeweled with ivory palaces like these:
    by day a miracle a dream by night;
   yet real as beauty is and as the seas
    whose waves glance back keen lines of glittering light
   when million lamps and coronets of fire
   and fountains as of flame to the bright stars aspire

   iv

   glide magic boat from out the green lagoon
    neath the dark bridge into this smiting glow
   and unthought glory even the glistening moon
    hangs in the nearer splendor let not go
   the scene my soul till ever t is thine own!
    this is arts citadel and crown how still
   the innumerous multitudes from every zone
    that watch and listen; while each eye doth fill
   with joyous tears unwept now solemn strains
    of brazen music give the waiting soul
   voice and a sighit other speech disdains
    here where the visual sense faints to its goal!
   ah silent multitudes ye are a part
   of the wise architects supreme and glorious art!

   v

   o joy almost too high for saddened mortal!
    o ecstasy envisioned! thou shouldst be
   lasting as thou art lovely; as immortal
    as through all time the matchless thought of thee!
   yet would we miss then the sweet piercing pain
    of thy inconstancy! could we but banish
   this haunting pang ah then thou wouldst not reign
    one with the golden sunset that doth vanish
   through myriad lingering tints down melting skies;
    nor the pale mystery of the new world flower
   that blooms once only then forever dies
    pouring a centurys wealth on one dear hour
   then vanish city of dream and be no more;
   soon shall this fair earths self be lost on the unknown shore

   the tower of flame

   (the columbian exposition july 10 1893)

   here for the world to see men brought their fairest
    whatever of beauty is in all the earth;
   the priceless flower of art the loveliest rarest
    here by our inland ocean came to glorious birth

   yet on this day of doom a strange new splendor
    shed its celestial light on all mens eyes:
   flower of the herosoulconsummate tender
    that from the tower of flame sprang to the eternal skies

   lowell

   i

   from the shade of the elms that murmured above thy birth
   and the pines that sheltered thy life and shadowed the end
   neath the whiteblue skies thee to thy rest we bore
   neath the summer skies thou didst love mid the songs of thy birds
   by thy childhoods stream neath the grass and the flowers thou
   knewest
   near the grave of the singer whose name with thine own is enlaureled
   by the side of the brave who live in thy deathless song
   here all that was mortal of thee we left with our tears
   with our love and our grief that could not be quenched or abated;
   for even the part that was mortal sweet friend and companion!
   that face and that figure of beauty and flashing eye
   which in youth shone forth like a gods mid lesser men
   and in grayhaired strenuous age still glowed and lustered
   these too were dear to usblame us not soaring spirit!
   these too were dear and now we shall never behold them
   nor ever shall feel the quick clasp of thy welcoming hand

   ii

   but not for ourselves alone are we spent in grieving
   for the stricken land we mourn whose light is darkened
   whose soul in sorrow went forth in the nighttime with thine
   lover and laureate thou of the wide new world
   whose pines and prairies and people and teeming soil
   where was shaken of old the seed of the freedom of men
   thou didst love as a strong man loveth the maiden he woos
   not the woman he toys with and sings to and passing forgets
   whom he woos whom he wins whom he weds; his passion his pride;
   who no shadow of wrong shall suffer who shall stand in his sight
   pure as the sky of the evil her foeman may threat
   save by word or by thought of her own in her whiteness untouched
   and wounded alone of the lightning her spirit engenders

   iii

   take of thy grief new strength new life o land!
   weep no more he is lost but rejoice and be glad forever
   that thy lover who died was born for thy pleasure thy glory
   while his love and his fame light ever thy climbing path

    august 14 1891

   the silence of tennyson

   when that great shade into the silence vast
   through thinking silence past;
   when he our centurys soul and voice was husht
   we whoappalled bowed crusht
   within the holy moonlight of his death
   waited the parting breath;
   ah not in song
   might we our grief prolong
   silence alone o golden spirit fled!
   silence alone could mourn that silence dread

   on the death of a great man

   phillips brooks

   when from this mortal scene
   a great soul passes to the vast unknown
   let not in hopeless grief the spirit groan
   death comes to all the mighty and the mean
   if by that death the whole world suffer loss
   this be the proof (and lighter thus our cross)
   that he for whom the world doth sorely grieve
   greatly hath blessed mankind in that he once did live
   then at the parting breath
   let men praise life nor idly blame dark death

   a hero of peace

   in memory of robert ross: shot march 6 1894

   no bugle on the blast
    calls warriors face to face;
   grim battle being forever past
    gone is the herorace

   ah no! there is no peace!
    if liberty shall live
   never may freemen dare to cease
    their love their life to give

   unto the patriots heart
    the silent summons comes;
   not braver he who does his part
    to the sound of beating drums

   and thou who gavest youth
    and life and all most dear;
   sweet soul impassionate of truth
    white on thy murdered bier!

   thy deed thy date thy name
    are wreathed with deathless flowers
   thy fate shall be the guiding flame
    that lights to nobler hours

   the battle monument october 19 1893

   since ancient time began
    ever on some great soul god laid an infinite burden
   the weight of all this world the hopes of man
    conflict and pain and fame immortal are his guerdon!

   and this the unfaltering token
    of him the delivererwhat tho tempests beat
   tho all else fail tho bravest ranks be broken
    he stands unscared alone nor ever knows defeat

   such was that man of men;
    and if are praised all virtues every fame
   most noble highest purestthen ah! then
    upleaps in every heart the name none needs to name

   ye who defeated whelmed
    betray the sacred cause let go the trust;
   sleep weary while the vessel drifts unhelmed;
    here see in triumph rise the hero from the dust!

   all ye who fight forlorn
    gainst fate and failure; ye who proudly cope
   with evil high enthroned; all ye who scorn
    life from dishonors hand here take new heart of hope

   here know how victory borrows
    for the brave soul a front as of disaster
   and from the bannered east what glorious morrows
    for all the blackness of the night speed surer faster

   know by this pillared sign
    for what brief while the powers of earth and hell
   can war against the spirit of truth divine
    or can against the heroic heart of man prevail

   fame

   fame is an honest thing
   it is deceivèd not;
   it passes by the palace gates
   where the crowned usurper waits
   enters the peasantpoets cot
   and cries: thou art the king!

   a monument by saintgaudens

   this is not death nor sorrow nor sad hope;
   nor rest that follows strife but o more dread!
   t is life for all its agony serene;
   immortal and unmournful and content

   a memory of rubinstein

   he of the ocean is its thunderous waves
   echo his music; while far down the shore
   mad laughter hurriesa white blowing spume
   i hear again in memory that wild storm;
   the winds of heaven go rushing round the world
   and broods above the rage one sphinxlike face

   if songs were perfume color wild desire;
   if poets words were fire
   that burned to blood in purplepulsing veins;
   if with a birdlike thrill the moments throbbed to hours;
   if summers rains
   turned drop by drop to shy sweet maiden flowers;
   if god made flowers with light and music in them
   and saddened hearts could win them;
   if loosened petals touched the ground
   with a caressing sound;
    if loves eyes uttered word
   no listening lover eer before had heard;
   if silent thoughts spake with a bugles voice;
   if flame passed into song and cried rejoice! rejoice!
    if words could picture lifes hopes heavens eclipse
   when the last kiss has fallen on dying eyes and lips;
   if all of mortal woe
   struck on one heart with breathless blow on blow;
    if melody were tears and tears were starry gleams
   that shone in evenings amethystine dreams;
   ah yes if notes were stars each star a different hue
   trembling to earth in dew;
   or if the boreal pulsings rose and white
   made a majestic music in the night;
   if all the orbs lost in the light of day
   in the deep silent blue began their harps to play;
    and when in frightening skies the lightnings flashed
   and stormclouds crashed
   if every stroke of light and sound were but excess of beauty;
   if human syllables could eer refashion
   that fierce electric passion;
   if other art could match (as were the poets duty)
   the grieving and the rapture and the thunder
   of that keen hour of wonder
   that light as if of heaven that blackness as of hell
   how the great master plays then might i dare to tell

   ii

    how the great master plays! and was it he
   or some disbodied spirit which had rushed
   from silence into singing; and had crushed
   into one startled hour a lifes felicity
   and highest bliss of knowledgethat all pain grief wrong
   turn at the last to beauty and to song!

   handels largo

   when the great organs answering each to each
   joined with the violins celestial speech
   then did it seem that all the heavenly host
   gave praise to father son and holy ghost:
   we saw the archangels through the ether winging;
   we heard their souls go forth in solemn singing;
   praise praise to god they sang through endless days
   praise to the eternal one and naught but praise;
   and as they sang the spirits of the dying
   were upward borne from lips that ceased their sighing;
   and dying was not death but deeper living
   living and prayer and praising and thanksgiving!

   the stairway

   by this stairway narrow steep
   thou shalt climb from song to sleep;
   from sleep to dream and song once more;
   sleep well sweet friend sleep well dream deep!

   the actor

   glorious that ancient art!
   in thine own form to show the fire and fashion
   of every age and clime of every passion
   that dwells in mans deep heart!

   player play well not meanly
   thy part in life as on the mimic stage!
   from highest thought is born arts noblest rage:
   live act end all serenely!

   the stricken player

   when at lifes last the stricken player lies
   when throng before his darkened dreaming eyes
   his souls companions which more real then
   the human comrades the live women and men
   of the large world he knew or the ideal
   imagined creatures his own art made real;
   wherein he poured his spirits very being
   his soul and body? are those dim eyes seeing
   himself as one of shakespeares men? are maids
   and queens he wooed the kings he was or knew
   upon the tragic stage are these the shades
   that now his visionary hours pursue
   attendant on his passing? listen near!
   what breathed murmurs scape those pallid lips
   to which the nations hearkened ere the eclipse
   of all that brightness? now lean close and hear;
   ah see that look sweeter than when he smiled
   upon the applauding world while she draws near
   and hears a dear voice whisper: child my child!

   an autumn dirge

   (e f h)

   i

   o ease my heart sad song o ease my heart!
   in all this autumn pageantry no part
   hath sorrow! woods and fields and meadows glow
   with jeweled colors all alone i go
   amid the poignant beauty of the year
   too heavyhearted for one easeful tear
    for she who loved this autumn splendor
   these flaming marshflowers oakleaves rich and tender
   and who in loving all made all to me more dear
   no more is here;
   no more no more is here!
    sad song o bring some thought
   with music from some happy memory caught!
   no light for me in all the lovely day
   those eyes being shut that first did lead the way
   neath these great pines whose green vault hides the sky
   and down the rockstrewn shore where the white seabirds cry!

   ii

    all fades but those young happy hours
   and in my soul once more the old joy flowers
   it flowers once more only to bring new pain;
   for all in vain
   o song! thou singest in my grieving heart!
   thou hast no art
   to bring again the smile i loved so well
   the voice that like a bell
   sounded all moods of sorrow and of laughter
   and the dear presence that in childhoods earliest thought
   and all the bright or darkened days thereafter
   into my life a saddened sweetness brought
   something of mother and of sister love
   a friendship far above
   the ties that bind and loosen as we tread
   the throngèd pleasures of lifes later days
    sweet maiden soul i cannot praise
   but mourn thee mourn thee to the shadows fled

   ii

    shadows o nevermore!
   for when past forth thy spirit it did seem
   as if against the black a golden door
   were opened and a gleam
   from the eternal light fell on thy face
   and made a visible glory in the place
    ah well i know
   whatever be the source from whence we flow
   whateer the power begot these hearts of ours
   as the great earth brings forth the summer flowers
   that power is good is god and in her dying room
   humaned itself to sense and lightened all the gloom

   eleonora duse

   if ever flashed upon this mortal scene
   a soul unsheathèd a pale trembling flame
   that suffered every gust and yet did cling
   with fire unquenchableit is thine own
   thou artist of the real! unto thee
   no mirth of life is secret; but sweet soul
   with what sure art thou picturest human woe!
   how natural tears to those italian eyes
   shadowing in untold depths whatever grief familiar is to mortals!

   kelp rock

   (e c s)

   rocks the songsoil truly
   (so sang one bard of power);
   therefore our poet duly
   built on this rock his tower;
   and therefore in his singing
   we breathe the salty morning;
   we hear the stormbell ringing
   the sirens piercing warning
   the seawinds roaring sighing
   the long waves rising falling;
   we hear the herons calling
   the clashing waves replying

   at niagara

   i

   there at the chasms edge behold her lean
   trembling as neath the charm
   a wild bird lifts no wing to scape from harm;
   her very soul drawn to the glittering green
   smooth lustrous awful lovely curve of peril;
   while far below the bending sea of beryl
   thunder and tumultwhence a billowy spray
   enclouds the day

   ii

   what dream is hers? no dream hath wrought that spell!
   the long waves rise and sink;
   pity that virgin soul on passions brink
   confronting fateswift unescapable
   fate which of nature is the intent and core
   and dark and strong as the steep rivers pour
   cruel as love and wild as loves first kiss!
   ah god! the abyss!

   the childgarden

   in the childgarden buds and blows
   a blossom lovelier than the rose

   if all the flowers of all the earth
   in one garden broke to birth

   not the fairest of the fair
   could with this sweet bloom compare;

   nor would all their shining be
   peer to its lone bravery

   fairer than the rose i say?
   fairer than the sunbright day

   in whose rays all glories show
   all beauty is all blossoms blow;

   while beside it deeply shine
   blooms that take its light divine:

   the perilous sweet flower of hope
   here its hiding eyes doth ope

   and gentleness doth near uphold
   its healing leaves and heart of gold;

   here tender fingers push the seed
   of knowledge; pluck the poisonous weed;

   here blossoms joy one singing hour
   and here of love the immortal flower

   what this blossom fragrant tender
   that outbeams the roses splendor

   purer is more tinct with light
   than the lilys flame of white?

   of beauty hath this flower the whole
   and its namethe human soul!

   the christchild

   a picture by frank vincent du mond

   done is the day of care
   into the shadowy room
   flows the pure evening light
   to stem the gathering gloom
   the lilys flame illume
   and the bowed heads make bright
   the heads bowed low in prayer

    see how the level rays
   through the white garments pour
   of the holy child who stands
   with bending brow to implore
   grace on the toilers store;
   o see those sinless hands!
   behold the christchild prays!

    wait wait ye lingering rays
   stand still o earth and sun
   draw near thou soul of god
   this is the suffering one!
   already the way is begun
   the piercèd savior trod;
   and now the christchild prays
   the holy christchild prays

   a child

   her voice was like the song of birds;
    her eyes were like the stars;
   her little waving hands were like
    birds wings that beat the bars

   and when those waving hands were still
    her soul had fled away
   the music faded from the air
    the color from the day

   two valleys

   yes t is a glorious sight
   this valley that mountain hight

   the river plunges and roars
   like the loud sea on its shores

   what time in waves enorm
   breaks the gigantic storm

   the wooded mount doth climb
   to a thought intense sublime

   the glory of all i feel;
   but my heart my heart will steal

   down the journey of years
   through the lands of laughter and tears

   far back to the least of valleys
   where a slow brook curves and dallies

   where a boy in the twilight gleam
   walks alone with his dream

   on the bay

   this watery vague how vast! this misty globe
   seen from this center where the ferry plies
   it plies but seems to poise in middle air
   soft gray below gray heavens and in the west
   a rosegray memory of the sunken sun;
   and where gray water touches grayer sky
   a band of darker gray prickt out with lights
   a diamondtwinkling circlet bounding all;
   and where the statue looms a quenchless star;
   and where the lighthouse a red pulsing flame;
   while the great bridge its starry diadem
   lifts through the gray itself in grayness lost!

   washington square

   this is the end of the town that i love the best
   o lovely the hour of light from the burning west
   of light that lingers and fades in the shadowy square
   where the solemn fountain lifts a shaft in the air
   to catch the skyey colors and fling them down
   in a wildwood torrent that drowns the noise of the town
   and lovely the hour of the still and dreamy night
   when lifted against the blue stands the arch of white
   with one clear planet above; and the sickle moon
   in curve reversed from the archs marble round
   silvers the sapphire sky now soon ah soon
   shall the city square be turned to holy ground
   through the light of the moon and the stars and the glowing flower
   the cross of lightthat looms from the sacred tower

   the city

   o dear is the song of the pine
    when the wind of the nighttime blows
   and dear is the murmuring river
    that afar through my childhood flows;
   and soft is the raindrops beat
    and the fountains lyric play
   but to me no music is half so sweet
    as the thunder of broadway!

   stream of the living world
    where dash the billows of strife!
   one plunge in the mighty torrent
    is a year of tamer life!
   city of glorious days
    of hope and labor and mirth
   with room and to spare on thy splendid bays
    for the ships of all the earth!

   a rhyme of tyringham

   down in the meadow and up on the hight
   the breezes are blowing the willows white
   in the elms and maples the robins call
   and the great black crow sails over all
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   the river winds through the trees and the brake
   and the meadowgrass like a shining snake;
   and low in the summer and loud in the spring
   the rapids and reaches murmur and sing
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   in the shadowy pools the trout are shy
   so creep to the bank and cast the fly!
   what thrills and tremors the tense cords stir
   when the trout it strikes with a tug and a whir
    in tyringham tyringham valley!

   at dark of the day the mist spreads white
   like a magic lake in the glimmering light;
   or the winds from the meadow the white mists blow
   and the fireflies glittera sky below
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   and o in the windy days of the fall
   the maples and elms are scarlet all
   and the world that was green is gold and red
   and with huskings and cider they re late to bed
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   now squirrel and partridge and hawk and hare
   and wildcat and woodchuck and fox beware!
   the three days hunt is waxing warm
   for the count up dinner at riverside farm
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   the meadowice will be freezing soon
   and then for a skate by the light of the moon
   so pile the wood on the hearth my boy!
   winter is coming! i wish you joy
   by the light of the hearth and the moon my boy
    in tyringham tyringham valley

   elsie

   do you love me? elsie asked
   and her roseleaf dimples masked
   neath a pleading look the while
   on her pouting lips a smile
   hovered yet was out of sight
   like a star thats hid at night
   by a filmy flying cloud
   do you love me? scarce aloud
   lovely cousin elsie said
   why no answer cousin ed?
   do you hate me then or why
   from your highness no reply?
   so the chiding witch ran on:
   in a moment ill be gone;
   then too late sir no gallant!
   quick! ill tell my precious aunt
   that you love me not she cries
   that you hate me and despise
   flash the great gray longlashed eyes;
   half in earnest now the girl;
   down the pretty corners curl
   of the tiny mouth and lo!
   from those eyes two tearlets flow;
   just two kisses and they go!
   like a sunburst after showers
   like white light upon the flowers
   now again the dimples show
    but she could not understand
   why so long the answer waited
   for the loved and not the hated
   while he held that little hand
   and like a bird she sang and said
   half in earnest half in fun
   do you love me solemn one?
   do you love me cousin ed?
   do you love me? do you love me?
   love me love me cousin ed?

   indirection

   i saw not the leaf
    but its shadow trembling trembling down
   i faced to northward to my grief
    when from the southern sky a crimson meteor lit the stardark town
   i saw not naked love
   lean from his porphyry throne above
   and touch her heart to flame
   yet on her brow i saw the swift sweet virgin shame

   ah be not false

   ah be not false sweet splendor!
    be true be good;
   be wise as thou art tender;
    be all that beauty should

   not lightly be thy citadel subdued;
    not ignobly not untimely
   take praise in solemn mood;
    take love sublimely

   the answer

   through starry space two angels dreamed their flight
   mid worlds and thoughts of worlds through day and night

   then one spake forth whose voice was like the flower
   that blossoms in the fragrant midnight hour
   this whitebrowed angel of the other asked:
    of all the essences that ever basked
   in the eternal presence; of all things
   all thoughts all joys all dreads all sorrowings
   amid the unimaginable vast
   being or shall be or forever past
   profound with dark or hid in endless light
   which of all these most deep and infinite?
    then did the elder speak the while he turned
   on him who asked clear eyes that slowly burned
   the spirit through like to a living coal:
   no depth there is so deep as womans soul

   how death may make a man

   death is a sorry plight
    it bringeth unto man
   end of all delight
   yet many a woeful wight
    only dying can
    quit him like a man

   dawdling drawling silly
    maundering scarce a man;
   driven willynilly;
   when hes dying will he
    run as once he ran
    or quit him like a man?

   vile from out the wrack
    crawls he less than man;
   cowering in his track
   beaten broken black;
    curse him if you can
    death may make him man

   in life the wretch did naught
    worthy of a man;
   now by death hes caught
   what a change is wrought!
    whom the world did ban
    quits life like a man

   braced stiff against the wall
    behold at last a man
   lostlife and honor all!
   at deaths quick touch and call
    see the craven can
    quit him like a man

   came to a master of song

   came to a master of song
    and the human heart
   one who had followed him long
    and worshiped his art;
   one whom the poets singing
    had lured from death
   joy to the crusht soul bringing
    and heavens breath;

   came to him once in an hour
    of terror and stress
   and cried thou alone hast power
    to save me and bless;
   thou alone pure heart and free
    canst pluck from disaster
   if to a wretch like me
    thou wilt stoop o master!

   answered the bard with shame
    and sorrow and trembling:
   was i false was my song to blame?
    was my art dissembling?
   i of all mortals the saddest
    the quickest to fall
   and song of mine highest and gladdest
    repentance all!

   bards

   some from books resound their rhymes
    set them ringing with a faint
    sorrowful and sweet and quaint
   memory of the olden times
   like the sound of evening chimes

   some go wandering on their way
    through the forest past the herds
    laughing maidens singing birds;
   on their sylvan lutes they play
   danceth by the lyric day!

   bards there be the deep sky under
    who in high authentic verse
    mysteries and moods rehearse
   with a voice like sinais thunder
   chanting to a world of wonder

   and those have sung whose melody
    drawn from out the living heart
    with a quick unfaltering art
   hath power to make the listener cry:
   god in heaven! it is i

   meridian

   henceforth before these feet
   sinks the downward way;
   a little while to greet
   the light and life of day
   then nights slow fall
   ends all

   now forward heart elate
   tho steep the pathway slope
   time yet for love and hate
   joy and joys comrade hope
   ere nights slow fall
   ends all

   still the warm sky is blue
   no fleck the sunlight mars;
   twixt hills the sea gleams through;
   with twilight come the stars;
   and nights slow fall
   ends all

   in the coolbreathing night
   the starry sky is deep
   still on through glimmering light
   till we lie down to sleep;
   then let nights fall
   end all

   evening in tyringham valley

   what domes and pinnacles of mist and fire
    are builded in yon spacious realms of light
   all silently as did the walls aspire
    templing the ark of god by day and night!
   noiseless and swift from darkening ridge to ridge
    through purple air that deepens down the day
   over the valley springs a shadowy bridge
    the evening stars keen solitary ray
   makes more intense the silence and the glad
    unmelancholy restful twilight gloom
   so full of tenderness that even the sad
    remembrances that haunt the soul take bloom
   like that on yonder mountain
    now the bars
    of sunset all burn black; the day doth fail
   and the skies whiten with the eternal stars
    o let thy spirit stay with me sweet vale!

   each new year is a leaf of our loves rose;
   it falls but quick another roseleaf grows
   so is the flower from year to year the same
   but richer for the dead leaves feed its flame

   iia new soul

   to see the rose of morning slow unfold
   each wondrous petal to that heart of gold;
   to see from out the dark unknowing night
   a new soul dawn with such undreamedof light
   and slowly all its loveliness and splendor
   pour forth as stately music pours magnificently tender!

   iiikeep pure thy soul

   keep pure thy soul!
   then shalt thou take the whole
   of delight;
   then without a pang
   thine shall be all of beauty whereof the poet sang
   the perfume and the pageant the melody the mirth
   of the golden day and the starry night;
   of heaven and of earth
   o keep pure thy soul!

   thy mind is like a crystal brook

   accurst be he by whom it were undone
   or thing or thought whose presence
   the birds and beasts would loathly shun
   would make its crystal waters foully run
   and drive sweet childhood from its pleasance

    shall put thy spirit to the test
   haply or eer yon sinking sun
    shall drop behind the purple west
   all will be lostor won!

   vithe unknown

   how strange to look upon the life beyond
   our human cognizance with so deep awe
   and haunting dread; a sense as of remorse
   a lookingfor of judgment a great weight
   of things unknown to happen! we who live
   blindly from hour to hour in very midst
   of mysteries; of shapeless changing glooms;
   of nameless terrors; issues vast and black;
   of airy whims slight fantasies and flights
   that lead to unimaginable woe:
   the unweighed word cloying the life of love;
   one clod of earth outblotting all the stars;
   some secret dark inheritance of will
   and the scared soul plunges to conscious doom!
   thou who hast wisdom fear not death but life!

   viiirrevocable

   would the gods might give
   another field for human strife;
   man must live one life
   ere he learns to live
   ah friend in thy deep grave
   what now can change what now can save?

   because the rose must fade

   because the rose must fade
    shall i not love the rose?
   because the summer shade
    passes when winter blows
   shall i not rest me there
   in the cool air?

   because the sunset sky
    makes music in my soul
   only to fail and die
    shall i not take the whole
   of beauty that it gives
   while yet it lives?

   because the sweet of youth
    doth vanish all too soon
   shall i forget forsooth
    to learn its lingering tune;
   my joy to memorize
   in those young eyes?

   if like the summer flower
    that bloomsa fragrant death
   keen music hath no power
    to live beyond its breath
   then of this flood of song
   let me drink long!

   ah yes because the rose
    fades like the sunset skies;
   because rude winter blows
    all bare and music dies
   therefore now is to me
   eternity!

   fades the rose

   fades the rose; the year grows old;
   the tale is told;
   youth doth depart
   only stays the heart

   ah no! if stays the heart
   youth can neer depart
   nor the sweet tale be told
   never the rose fade nor the year grow old

   the wintry heart

   on the sad winter trees
    the dead red leaves remain
   tho to and fro the bleak winds blow
    and falls the freezing rain

   so to the wintry heart
    clings color of the past
   while through dead leaves shudders and grieves
    the melancholy blast

   hast thou heard the nightingale?

   yes i have heard the nightingale
    as in dark woods i wandered
    and dreamed and pondered
    a voice past by all fire
    and passion and desire;
    i rather felt than heard
    the song of that lone bird;
   yes i have heard the nightingale

   yes i have heard the nightingale
    i heard it and i followed;
    the warm night swallowed
    this soul and body of mine
    as burning thirst takes wine
    while on and on i prest
    close to that singing breast;
   yes i have heard the nightingale

   yes i have heard the nightingale
    well doth each throbbing ember
    the flame remember;
    and i how quick that sound
    turned drops from a deep wound!
    how this heart was the thorn
    which pierced that breast forlorn!
   yes i have heard the nightingale

   in that dread dreamedof hour

   in that dread dreamedof hour
    when in her heart loves rose flames into flower
   t is never never yes
    but no no no whateer the startled eyes confess

   her frail denial at last
    swept clean away like burnt leaves in the blast
   no longer no no no!
    but yes forever yes while loves red rose doth blow

   rosedark the solemn sunset

   rosedark the solemn sunset
    that holds my thought of thee;
   with one star in the heavens
    and one star in the sea

   on high no lamp is lighted
    nor where the long waves flow
   save the one star of evening
    and the shadow star below

   light of my life! the darkness
    comes with the twilight dream;
   thou art the bright star shining
    i but the shadowy gleam

   winds to the silent morn

   winds to the silent morn;
    waves to the ocean;
   voice to the song unsung;
    song to emotion;
   light to the golden flower;
    bird to the tree;
   love to the heart of love
    and i to thee!

   dawn to the darkened world;
    hope to the morrow;
   music to passion; and
    weeping to sorrow;
   love to the heart that longs;
    moon to the sea;
   heaven to the earthborn soul
    and thou to me

   the unreturning

   i

   silent silent are the unreturning!
   what tho word may reach to them and yearning
   never through the stillness of the night
   never in the daytime or the dark
   comes the longlost voice or smile of light;
   lifts no hand from sea or sunken bark
   silent silent are the unreturning!

   ii

   silent silent are the unreturning!
   silent they?or are we undiscerning?
   child my child! is this thy answering voice
   murmuring far down the mountain lone?
   evenings smile that whispers: heart rejoice!
   mother mine! is this thy very own?
   nay! nay! silent are the unreturning;
   silent silent are the unreturning!

   two years

   o that was the year the last of those before thee;
    all my world till then but dark before the dawn
   if then i had died o never had i known thee
   never had beheld thee; i who won who own thee;
   who chose thee who sing thee crown thee and adore thee;
    o death it were indeed to die before that dawn!

   this was the year when first i did behold thee
    thou who on my darkness dawned with lyric light
   this the golden hour when first thy lover found thee
   followed and beguiled thee and with his singing bound thee;
   when all the world with music rang to drown thee and enfold thee
    thou who turned the darkness to song and love and light!

   we were sitting on a dilapidated seventeenthcentury tomb in the late
   afternoon of an autumn day at the old burying ground in arkham and
   speculating about the unnamable looking toward the giant willow in the
   cemetery whose trunk had nearly engulfed an ancient illegible slab i
   had made a fantastic remark about the spectral and unmentionable
   nourishment which the colossal roots must be sucking from that hoary
   charnel earth; when my friend chided me for such nonsense and told me
   that since no interments had occurred there for over a century nothing
   could possibly exist to nourish the tree in other than an ordinary
   manner besides he added my constant talk about unnamable and
   unmentionable things was a very puerile device quite in keeping with
   my lowly standing as an author i was too fond of ending my stories
   with sights or sounds which paralyzed my heroes faculties and left
   them without courage words or associations to tell what they had
   experienced we know things he said only through our five senses or
   our intuitions; wherefore it is quite impossible to refer to any object
   or spectacle which cannot be clearly depicted by the solid definitions
   of fact or the correct doctrines of theologypreferably those of the
   congregationalist with whatever modifications tradition and sir arthur
   conan doyle may supply

   with this friend joel manton i had often languidly disputed he was
   principal of the east high school born and bred in boston and sharing
   new englands selfsatisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of
   life it was his view that only our normal objective experiences
   possess any esthetic significance and that it is the province of the
   artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action ecstasy and
   astonishment as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by
   accurate detailed transcripts of everyday affairs especially did he
   object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained; for
   although believing in the supernatural much more fully than i he would
   not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment
   that a mind can find its greatest pleasure in escapes from the daily
   treadmill and in original and dramatic recombinations of images
   usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the hackneyed patterns of
   actual existence was something virtually incredible to his clear
   practical and logical intellect with him all things and feelings had
   fixed dimensions properties causes and effects; and although he
   vaguely knew that the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of
   far less geometrical classifiable and workable nature he believed
   himself justified in drawing an arbitrary line and ruling out of court
   all that cannot be experienced and understood by the average citizen
   besides he was almost sure that nothing can be really unnamable it
   didnt sound sensible to him

   though i well realized the futility of imaginative and metaphysical
   arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sundweller something
   in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual
   contentiousness the crumbling slate slabs the patriarchal trees and
   the centuried gambrel roofs of the witchhaunted old town that
   stretched around all combined to rouse my spirit in defense of my
   work; and i was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemys own country
   it was not indeed difficult to begin a counterattack for i knew
   that joel manton actually half clung to many oldwives superstitions
   which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance
   of dying persons at distant places and in the impressions left by old
   faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives to
   credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers i now insisted argued
   a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from
   and subsequent to their material counterparts it argued a capability
   of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man
   can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world or
   down the stretch of the centuries how can it be absurd to suppose that
   deserted houses are full of queer sentient things or that old
   graveyards teem with the terrible unbodied intelligence of
   generations? and since spirit in order to cause all the manifestations
   attributed to it cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter why
   is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in
   shapesor absences of shapeswhich must for human spectators be
   utterly and appallingly unnamable? common sense in reflecting on
   these subjects i assured my friend with some warmth is merely a
   stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility

   twilight had now approached but neither of us felt any wish to cease
   speaking manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments and eager to
   refute them having that confidence in his own opinions which had
   doubtless caused his success as a teacher; whilst i was too sure of my
   ground to fear defeat the dusk fell and lights faintly gleamed in
   some of the distant windows but we did not move our seat on the tomb
   was very comfortable and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind
   the cavernous rift in the ancient rootdisturbed brickwork close
   behind us or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the
   intervention of a tottering deserted seventeenthcentury house between
   us and the nearest lighted road there in the dark upon that riven
   tomb by the deserted house we talked on about the unnamable and
   after my friend had finished his scoffing i told him of the awful
   evidence behind the story at which he had scoffed the most

   my tale had been called the attic window and appeared in the january
   1922 issue of whispers in a good many places especially the south
   and the pacific coast they took the magazines off the stands at the
   complaints of silly milksops; but new england didnt get the thrill
   and merely shrugged its shoulders at my extravagance the thing it was
   averred was biologically impossible to start with; merely another of
   those crazy country mutterings which cotton mather had been gullible
   enough to dump into his chaotic magnalia christi americana and so
   poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality
   where the horror occurred and as to the way i amplified the bare
   jotting of the old mysticthat was quite impossible and
   characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler! mather had indeed
   told of the thing as being born but nobody but a cheap sensationalist
   would think of having it grow up look into peoples windows at night
   and be hidden in the attic of a house in flesh and in spirit till
   someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldnt describe what
   it was that turned his hair gray all this was flagrant trashiness and
   my friend manton was not slow to insist on that fact then i told him
   what i had found in an old diary kept between 1706 and 1723 unearthed
   among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting; that and
   the certain reality of the scars on my ancestors chest and back which
   the diary described i told him too of the fears of others in that
   region and how they were whispered down for generations; and how no
   mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an abandoned house
   to examine certain traces suspected to be there

   it had been an eldritch thingno wonder sensitive students shudder at
   the puritan age in massachusetts so little is known of what went on
   beneath the surfaceso little yet such a ghastly festering as it
   bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses the witchcraft
   terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in mens crushed
   brains but even that is a trifle there was no beauty; no freedomwe
   can see that from the architectural and household remains and the
   poisonous sermons of the cramped divines and inside that rusted iron
   straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness perversion and diabolism
   here truly was the apotheosis of the unnamable

   cotton mather in that demoniac sixth book which no one should read
   after dark minced no words as he flung forth his anathema stern as a
   jewish prophet and laconically unamazed as none since his day could
   be he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than
   beast but less than manthe thing with the blemished eyeand of the
   screaming drunken wretch that hanged for having such an eye this much
   he baldly told yet without a hint of what came after perhaps he did
   not know or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell others knew but
   did not dare to tellthere is no public hint of why they whispered
   about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a
   childless broken embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab
   by an avoided grave although one may trace enough evasive legends to
   curdle the thinnest blood

   it is all in that ancestral diary i found; all the hushed innuendoes
   and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the
   night or in deserted meadows near the woods something had caught my
   ancestor on a dark valley road leaving him with marks of horns on his
   chest and of apelike claws on his back; and when they looked for prints
   in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and
   vaguely anthropoid paws once a postrider said he saw an old man
   chasing and calling to a frightful loping nameless thing on meadow
   hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn and many believed him
   certainly there was strange talk one night in 1710 when the childless
   broken old man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of
   the blank slate slab they never unlocked that attic door but left the
   whole house as it was dreaded and deserted when noises came from it
   they whispered and shivered; and hoped that the lock on that attic door
   was strong then they stopped hoping when the horror occurred at the
   parsonage leaving not a soul alive or in one piece with the years the
   legends take on a spectral characteri suppose the thing if it was a
   living thing must have died the memory had lingered hideouslyall
   the more hideous because it was so secret

   during this narration my friend manton had become very silent and i
   saw that my words had impressed him he did not laugh as i paused but
   asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793 and who had
   presumably been the hero of my fiction i told him why the boy had gone
   to that shunned deserted house and remarked that he ought to be
   interested since he believed that windows latent images of those who
   had sat at them the boy had gone to look at the windows of that
   horrible attic because of tales of things seen behind them and had
   come back screaming maniacally

   manton remained thoughtful as i said this but gradually reverted to
   his analytical mood he granted for the sake of argument that some
   unnatural monster had really existed but reminded me that even the
   most morbid perversion of nature need not be unnamable or
   scientifically indescribable i admired his clearness and persistence
   and added some further revelations i had collected among the old
   people those later spectral legends i made plain related to
   monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be;
   apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes
   only tangible which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the
   old house the crypt behind it and the grave where a sapling had
   sprouted beside an illegible slab whether or not such apparitions had
   ever gored or smothered people to death as told in uncorroborated
   traditions they had produced a strong and consistent impression; and
   were yet darkly feared by very aged natives though largely forgotten
   by the last two generationsperhaps dying for lack of being thought
   about moreover so far as esthetic theory was involved if the psychic
   emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions what coherent
   representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a
   nebulosity as the specter of a malign chaotic perversion itself a
   morbid blasphemy against nature? molded by the dead brain of a hybrid
   nightmare would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome
   truth the exquisitely the shriekingly unnamable?

   the hour must now have grown very late a singularly noiseless bat
   brushed by me and i believe it touched manton also for although i
   could not see him i felt him raise his arm presently he spoke

   but is that house with the attic window still standing and deserted?

   yes i answered i have seen it

   and did you find anything therein the attic or anywhere else?

   there were some bones up under the eaves they may have been what that
   boy sawif he was sensitive he wouldnt have needed anything in the
   windowglass to unhinge him if they all came from the same object it
   must have been an hysterical delirious monstrosity it would have been
   blasphemous to leave such bones in the world so i went back with a
   sack and took them to the tomb behind the house there was an opening
   where i could dump them in dont think i was a foolyou ought to have
   seen that skull it had fourinch horns but a face and jaw something
   like yours and mine

   at last i could feel a real shiver run through manton who had moved
   very near but his curiosity was undeterred

   and what about the windowpanes?

   they were all gone one window had lost its entire frame and in all
   the others there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond
   apertures they were that kindthe old lattice windows that went out
   of use before 1700 i dont believe theyve had any glass for a hundred
   years or moremaybe the boy broke em if he got that far; the legend
   doesnt say

   manton was reflecting again

   id like to see that house carter where is it? glass or no glass i
   must explore it a little and the tomb where you put those bones and
   the other grave without an inscriptionthe whole thing must be a bit
   terrible

   you did see ituntil it got dark

   my friend was more wrought upon than i had suspected for at this touch
   of harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and
   actually cried out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain
   of previous repression it was an odd cry and all the more terrible
   because it was answered for as it was still echoing i heard a
   creaking sound through the pitchy blackness and knew that a lattice
   window was opening in that accursed old house beside us and because
   all the other frames were long since fallen i knew that it was the
   grisly glassless frame of that demoniac attic window

   then came a noxious rush of noisome frigid air from that same dreaded
   direction followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that
   shocking rifted tomb of man and monster in another instant i was
   knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen
   entity of titanic size but undetermined nature; knocked sprawling on
   the rootclutched mold of that abhorrent graveyard while from the tomb
   came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy
   peopled the rayless gloom with miltonic legions of the misshapen
   damned there was a vortex of withering icecold wind and then the
   rattle of loose bricks and plaster; but i had mercifully fainted before
   i could learn what it meant

   manton though smaller than i is more resilient; for we opened our
   eyes at almost the same instant despite his greater injuries our
   couches were side by side and we knew in a few seconds that we were in
   st marys hospital attendants were grouped about in tense curiosity
   eager to aid our memory by telling us how we came there and we soon
   heard of the farmer who had found us at noon in a lonely field beyond
   meadow hill a mile from the old burying ground on a spot where an
   ancient slaughterhouse is reputed to have stood manton had two
   malignant wounds in the chest and some less severe cuts or gougings in
   the back i was not so seriously hurt but was covered with welts and
   contusions of the most bewildering character including the print of a
   split hoof it was plain that manton knew more than i but he told
   nothing to the puzzled and interested physicians till he had learned
   what our injuries were then he said we were the victims of a vicious
   bullthough the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for

   after the doctors and nurses had left i whispered an awe struck
   question:

   good god manton but what was it? those scarswas it like that?

   and i was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing i had half
   expected

   noit wasnt that way at all it was everywherea gelatina slime
   yet it had shapes a thousand shapes of horror beyond all memory there
   were eyesand a blemish it was the pitthe maelstromthe ultimate
   abomination carter it was the unnamable!

   the very old folk
   by h p lovecraft
   70742the very old folkh p lovecraft

   it was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town
   of pompelo at the foot of the pyrenees in hispania citerior the year
   must have been in the late republic for the province was still ruled
   by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prætorian legate of augustus
   and the day was the first before the kalends of november the hills
   rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town and the
   westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and
   plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus
   some distance to the east groups of citizens broadbrowed roman
   colonists and coarsehaired romanised natives together with obvious
   hybrids of the two strains alike clad in cheap woollen togas and
   sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarsemantled blackbearded
   tribesmen of the circumambient vascones all thronged the few paved
   streets and forum; moved by some vague and illdefined uneasiness

   i myself had just alighted from a litter which the illyrian bearers
   seemed to have brought in some haste from calagurris across the iberus
   to the southward it appeared that i was a provincial quæstor named l
   cælius rufus and that i had been summoned by the proconsul p
   scribonius libo who had come from tarraco some days before the
   soldiers were the fifth cohort of the xiith legion under the military
   tribune sex asellius; and the legatus of the whole region cn
   balbutius had also come from calagurris where the permanent station
   was

   the cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills all
   the townsfolk were frightened and had begged the presence of a cohort
   from calagurris it was the terrible season of the autumn and the wild
   people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies
   which only rumour told of in the towns they were the very old folk who
   dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the
   vascones could not understand one seldom saw them; but a few times a
   year they sent down little yellow squinteyed messengers (who looked
   like scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures and
   every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks
   their howlings and altarfires throwing terror into the villages
   always the same the night before the kalends of maius and the night
   before the kalends of november townsfolk would disappear just before
   these nights and would never be heard of again and there were
   whispers that the native shepherds and farmers were not illdisposed
   toward the very old folk that more than one thatched hut was vacant
   before midnight on the two hideous sabbaths

   this year the horror was very great for the people knew that the wrath
   of the very old folk was upon pompelo three months previously five of
   the little squinteyed traders had come down from the hills and in a
   market brawl three of them had been killed the remaining two had gone
   back wordlessly to their mountains and this autumn not a single
   villager had disappeared there was menace in this immunity it was not
   like the very old folk to spare their victims at the sabbath it was
   too good to be normal and the villagers were afraid

   for many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills and at
   last the ædile tib annæus stilpo (half native in blood) had sent to
   balbutius at calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the sabbath on the
   terrible night balbutius had carelessly refused on the ground that
   the villagers fears were empty and that the loathsome rites of hill
   folk were of no concern to the roman people unless our own citizens
   were menaced

   i however who seemed to be a close friend of balbutius had disagreed
   with him; averring that i had studied deeply in the black forbidden
   lore and that i believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost
   any nameless doom upon the town which after all was a roman settlement
   and contained a great number of our citizens the complaining ædiles
   own mother helvia was a pure roman the daughter of m helvius cinna
   who had come over with scipios army accordingly i had sent a slave a
   nimble little greek called antipater to the proconsul with letters
   and scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered balbutius to send his
   fifth cohort under asellius to pompelo; entering the hills at dusk on
   the eve of novembers kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies
   he might find bringing such prisoners as he might take to tarraco for
   the next proprætors court balbutius however had protested so that
   more correspondence had ensued i had written so much to the proconsul
   that he had become gravely interested and had resolved to make a
   personal inquiry into the horror

   he had at length proceeded to pompelo with his lictors and attendants;
   there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed and
   standing firmly by his order for the sabbaths extirpation desirous of
   conferring with one who had studied the subject he ordered me to
   accompany asellius cohort and balbutius had also come along to press
   his adverse advice for he honestly believed that drastic military
   action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the
   vascones both tribal and settled

   so here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills old
   scribonius libo in his toga prætexta the golden light glancing on his
   shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face balbutius with his gleaming
   helmet and breastplate blueshaven lips compressed in conscientiously
   dogged opposition young asellius with his polished greaves and
   superior sneer and the curious throng of townsfolk legionaries
   tribesmen peasants lictors slaves and attendants i myself seemed
   to wear a common toga and to have no especially distinguishing
   characteristic and everywhere horror brooded the town and country
   folk scarcely dared speak aloud and the men of libos entourage who
   had been there nearly a week seemed to have caught something of the
   nameless dread old scribonius himself looked very grave and the sharp
   voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious
   inappropriateness as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic
   god

   we entered the prætorium and held grave converse balbutius pressed his
   objections and was sustained by asellius who appeared to hold all the
   natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it
   inadvisable to excite them both soldiers maintained that we could
   better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised
   natives by inaction than to antagonise a probable majority of
   tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites

   i on the other hand renewed my demand for action and offered to
   accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake i pointed
   out that the barbarous vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain
   so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever
   course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous
   adversaries to our legions and that it would ill become the
   representatives of the roman people to suffer barbarians to interfere
   with a course which the justice and prestige of the republic demanded
   that on the other hand the successful administration of a province
   depended primarily upon the safety and goodwill of the civilized
   element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity
   reposed and in whose veins a large mixture of our own italian blood
   coursed these though in numbers they might form a minority were the
   stable element whose constancy might be relied on and whose
   cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the imperium of the
   senate and the roman people

   it was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection
   due to roman citizens; even (and here i shot a sarcastic look at
   balbutius and asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and
   activity and of a slight interruption of the draughtplaying and
   cockfighting at the camp in calagurris that the danger to the town
   and inhabitants of pompelo was a real one i could not from my studies
   doubt i had read many scrolls out of syria and Ægyptus and the
   cryptic towns of etruria and had talked at length with the
   bloodthirsty priest of diana aricina in his temple in the woods
   bordering lacus nemorensis

   there were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the
   sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the
   roman people; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at
   sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those
   whose forefathers a postumius being consul had executed so many
   roman citizens for the practice of the bacchanalia a matter kept ever
   in memory by the senatus consultum de bacchanalibus graven upon bronze
   and set open to every eye

   checked in time before the progress of the rites might evoke anything
   with which the iron of a roman pilum might not be able to deal the
   sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort only
   participants need be apprehended and the sparing of a great number of
   mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of
   the sympathising country folk might feel in short both principle and
   policy demanded stern action; and i could not doubt but that publius
   scribonius bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman
   people would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort me
   accompanying despite such objections as balbutius and asellius
   speaking indeed more like provincials than romans might see fit to
   offer and multiply

   the slanting sun was now very low and the whole hushed town seemed
   draped in an unreal and malign glamour then p scribonius the
   proconsul signified his approval of my words and stationed me with the
   cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; balbutius
   and asellius assenting the former with better grace than the latter
   as twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes a measured hideous
   beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm
   some few of the legionarii showed timidity but sharp commands brought
   them into line and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open
   plain east of the circus libo himself as well as balbutius insisted
   on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in
   getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain finally
   a young man named vercellius the son of pure roman parents agreed to
   take us at least past the foothills

   we began to march in the new dusk with the thin silver sickle of a
   young moon trembling over the woods on our left that which disquieted
   us most was the fact that the sabbath was to be held at all reports of
   the coming cohort must have reached the hills and even the lack of a
   final decision could not make the rumour less alarming yet there were
   the sinister drums as of yore as if the celebrants had some peculiar
   reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the roman people
   marched against them the sound grew louder as we entered a rising gap
   in the hills steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on either side
   and displaying curiously fantastic treetrunks in the light of our
   bobbing torches

   all were afoot save libo balbutius asellius two or three of the
   centuriones and myself and at length the way became so steep and
   narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of
   ten men being left to guard them though robber bands were not likely
   to be abroad on such a night of terror once in a while it seemed as
   though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby and after a
   halfhours climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the
   advance of so great a body of men  over 300 all told  exceedingly
   cumbrous and difficult then with utter and horrifying suddenness we
   heard a frightful sound from below it was from the tethered horses 
   they had screamed not neighed but screamed and there was no light
   down there nor the sound of any human thing to show why they had done
   so at the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead so
   that terror seemed to lurk equally well before and behind us

   looking for the youth vercellius our guide we found only a crumpled
   heap weltering in a pool of blood in his hand was a short sword
   snatched from the belt of d vibulanus a subcenturio and on his face
   was such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the
   sight he had killed himself when the horses screamed he who had
   been born and lived all his life in that region and knew what men
   whispered about the hills all the torches now began to dim and the
   cries of frightened legionaries mingled with the unceasing screams of
   the tethered horses the air grew perceptibly colder more suddenly so
   than is usual at novembers brink and seemed stirred by terrible
   undulations which i could not help connecting with the beating of huge
   wings

   the whole cohort now remained at a standstill and as the torches faded
   i watched what i thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by
   the spectral luminosity of the via lactea as it flowed through perseus
   cassiopeia cepheus and cygnus then suddenly all the stars were
   blotted from the sky  even bright deneb and vega ahead and the lone
   altair and fomalhaut behind us and as the torches died out altogether
   there remained above the stricken and shrieking cohort only the noxious
   and horrible altarflames on the towering peaks; hellish and red and
   now silhouetting the mad leaping and colossal forms of such nameless
   beasts as had never a phrygian priest or campanian grandam whispered of
   in the wildest of furtive tales

   and above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dæmonic drumming
   rose to louder pitch whilst an icecold wind of shocking sentience and
   deliberateness swept down from those forbidden heights and coiled about
   each man separately till all the cohort was struggling and screaming
   in the dark as if acting out the fate of laocoön and his sons only
   old scribonius libo seemed resigned he uttered words amidst the
   screaming and they echo still in my ears malitia vetus  malitia
   vetus est  venit  tandem venit 1

   and then i waked it was the most vivid dream in years drawing upon
   wells of the subconscious long untouched and forgotten of the fate of
   that cohort no record exists but the town at least was saved  for
   encyclopædias tell of the survival of pompelo to this day under the
   modern spanish name of pompelona

   8532the white shiph p lovecraft1919

   i am basil elton keeper of the north point light that my father and
   grandfather kept before me far from the shore stands the gray
   lighthouse above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is
   low but unseen when the tide is high past that beacon for a century
   have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas in the days of my
   grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and
   now there are so few that i sometimes feel strangely alone as though i
   were the last man on our planet

   from far shores came those whitesailed argosies of old; from far
   eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odors linger about
   strange gardens and gay temples the old captains of the sea came often
   to my grandfather and told him of these things which in turn he told to
   my father and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when
   the wind howled eerily from the east and i have read more of these
   things and of many things besides in the books men gave me when i was
   young and filled with wonder

   but more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is
   the secret lore of ocean blue green gray white or black; smooth
   ruffled or mountainous; that ocean is not silent all my days have i
   watched it and listened to it and i know it well at first it told to
   me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports but with
   the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things
   more strange and more distant in space and time sometimes at twilight
   the gray vapors of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the
   ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have
   grown clear and phosphorescent to grant me glimpses of the ways
   beneath and these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were
   and the ways that might be as of the ways that are; for ocean is more
   ancient than the mountains and freighted with the memories and the
   dreams of time

   out of the south it was that the white ship used to come when the moon
   was full and high in the heavens out of the south it would glide very
   smoothly and silently over the sea and whether the sea was rough or
   calm and whether the wind was friendly or adverse it would always
   glide smoothly and silently its sails distant and its long strange
   tiers of oars moving rhythmically one night i espied upon the deck a
   man bearded and robed and he seemed to beckon me to embark for far
   unknown shores many times afterward i saw him under the full moon and
   never did he beckon me

   very brightly did the moon shine on the night i answered the call and
   i walked out over the waters to the white ship on a bridge of
   moonbeams the man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft
   language i seemed to know well and the hours were filled with soft
   songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious south golden
   with the glow of that full mellow moon

   and when the day dawned rosy and effulgent i beheld the green shore
   of far lands bright and beautiful and to me unknown up from the sea
   rose lordly terraces of verdure treestudded and shewing here and
   there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples as we
   drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land the
   land of zar where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that
   come to men once and then are forgotten and when i looked upon the
   terraces again i saw that what he said was true for among the sights
   before me were many things i had once seen through the mists beyond the
   horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean there too were forms
   and fantasies more splendid than any i had ever known; the visions of
   young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they
   had seen and dreamed but we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows
   of zar for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to
   his native shore

   as the white ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of
   zar we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty
   city; and the bearded man said to me this is thalarion the city of a
   thousand wonders wherein reside all those mysteries that man has
   striven in vain to fathom and i looked again at closer range and
   saw that the city was greater than any city i had known or dreamed of
   before into the sky the spires of its temples reached so that no man
   might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the
   grim gray walls over which one might spy only a few roofs weird and
   ominous yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures i
   yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city and
   besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge
   carven gate akariel; but he gently denied my wish saying into
   thalarion the city of a thousand wonders many have passed but none
   returned therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer
   men and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who
   have looked upon the eidolon lathi that reigns over the city so the
   white ship sailed on past the walls of thalarion and followed for many
   days a southwardflying bird whose glossy plumage matched the sky out
   of which it had appeared

   then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue where
   as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbors
   beneath a meridian sun from bowers beyond our view came bursts of song
   and snatches of lyric harmony interspersed with faint laughter so
   delicious that i urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the
   scene and the bearded man spoke no word but watched me as we
   approached the lilylined shore suddenly a wind blowing from over the
   flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which i trembled
   the wind grew stronger and the air was filled with the lethal charnel
   odor of plaguestricken towns and uncovered cemeteries and as we
   sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at
   last saying this is xura the land of pleasures unattained

   so once more the white ship followed the bird of heaven over warm
   blessed seas fanned by caressing aromatic breezes day after day and
   night after night did we sail and when the moon was full we would
   listen to soft songs of the oarsmen sweet as on that distant night
   when we sailed away from my far native land and it was by moonlight
   that we anchored at last in the harbor of sonanyl which is guarded by
   twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a
   resplendent arch this is the land of fancy and we walked to the
   verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams

   in the land of sonanyl there is neither time nor space neither
   suffering nor death; and there i dwelt for many aeons green are the
   groves and pastures bright and fragrant the flowers blue and musical
   the streams clear and cool the fountains and stately and gorgeous the
   temples castles and cities of sonanyl of that land there is no
   bound for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful
   over the countryside and amidst the splendor of cities can move at will
   the happy folk of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and
   unalloyed happiness for the aeons that i dwelt there i wandered
   blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing
   clumps of bushes and where the white walks are bordered with delicate
   blossoms i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see
   entrancing panoramas of loveliness with steepled towns nestling in
   verdant valleys and with the golden domes of gigantic cities
   glittering on the infinitely distant horizon and i viewed by moonlight
   the sparkling sea the crystal headlands and the placid harbor wherein
   lay anchored the white ship

   it was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of tharp
   that i saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird and felt
   the first stirrings of unrest then i spoke with the bearded man and
   told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote cathuria which no
   man hath seen but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars
   of the west it is the land of hope and in it shine the perfect ideals
   of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate but the
   bearded man said to me beware of those perilous seas wherein men say
   cathuria lies in sonanyl there is no pain or death but who can tell
   what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the west? natheless at the next
   full moon i boarded the white ship and with the reluctant bearded man
   left the happy harbor for untraveled seas

   and the bird of heaven flew before and led us toward the basalt
   pillars of the west but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under
   the full moon in my mind i would often picture the unknown land of
   cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces and would wonder what
   new delights there awaited me cathuria i would say to myself is
   the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold its
   forests are of aloe and sandalwood even as the fragrant groves of
   camorin and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song on the
   green and flowery mountains of cathuria stand temples of pink marble
   rich with carven and painted glories and having in their courtyards
   cool fountains of silver where purr with ravishing music the scented
   waters that come from the grottoborn river narg and the cities of
   cathuria are cinctured with golden walls and their pavements also are
   of gold in the gardens of these cities are strange orchids and
   perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber at night the streets
   and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the
   threecolored shell of the tortoise and here resound the soft notes of
   the singer and the lutanist and the houses of the cities of cathuria
   are all palaces each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of
   the sacred narg of marble and porphyry are the houses and roofed with
   glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the
   splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant
   peaks fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch dorieb whom
   some say to be a demigod and others a god high is the palace of
   dorieb and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls in its wide
   halls many multitudes assemble and here hang the trophies of the ages
   and the roof is of pure gold set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure
   and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up
   to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus and the floor
   of the palace is of glass under which flow the cunningly lighted
   waters of the narg gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of
   lovely cathuria

   thus would i speak to myself of cathuria but ever would the bearded
   man warn me to turn back to the happy shore of sonanyl; for sonanyl
   is known of men while none hath ever beheld cathuria

   and on the thirtyfirst day that we followed the bird we beheld the
   basalt pillars of the west shrouded in mist they were so that no man
   might peer beyond them or see their summits  which indeed some say
   reach even to the heavens and the bearded man again implored me to
   turn back but i heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt
   pillars i fancied there came the notes of singers and lutanists;
   sweeter than the sweetest songs of sonanyl and sounding mine own
   praises; the praises of me who had voyaged far from the full moon and
   dwelt in the land of fancy so to the sound of melody the white ship
   sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and when
   the music ceased and the mist lifted we beheld not the land of
   cathuria but a swiftrushing resistless sea over which our helpless
   barque was borne toward some unknown goal soon to our ears came the
   distant thunder of falling waters and to our eyes appeared on the far
   horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract wherein the
   oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness then did the
   bearded man say to me with tears on his cheek we have rejected the
   beautiful land of sonanyl which we may never behold again the gods
   are greater than men and they have conquered and i closed my eyes
   before the crash that i knew would come shutting out the sight of the
   celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of
   the torrent

   out of that crash came darkness and i heard the shrieking of men and
   of things which were not men from the east tempestuous winds arose
   and chilled me as i crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen
   beneath my feet then as i heard another crash i opened my eyes and
   beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse whence i had sailed
   so many aeons ago in the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred
   outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks and as i glanced
   out over the waste i saw that the light had failed for the first time
   since my grandfather had assumed its care

   and in the later watches of the night when i went within the tower i
   saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when i had left it
   at the hour i sailed away with the dawn i descended the tower and
   looked for wreckage upon the rocks but what i found was only this: a
   strange dead bird whose hue was as of the azure sky and a single
   shattered spar of a whiteness greater than that of the wavetips or of
   the mountain snow

   and thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many
   times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens the white
   ship from the south came never again

   1336965the woodh p lovecraft

   they cut it down and where the pitchblack aisles
         of forest night had hid eternal things
   they scald the sky with towrs and marble piles
         to make a city for their revellings
   white and amazing to the lands around
         that wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose;
   crystal and ivory sublimely crownd
         with pinnacles that bore unmelting snows
   and through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang
         while wine and riot brought their scarlet stains;
   never a voice of elder marvels sang
         nor any eye calld up the hills and plains
   thus down the years till on one purple night
         a drunken minstrel in his careless verse
   spoke the vile words that should not see the light
         and stirrd the shadows of an ancient curse
   forests may fall but not the dusk they shield;
         so on the spot where that proud city stood
   the shuddering dawn no single stone reveald
         but fled the blackness of a primal wood

   upon an eroded clifftop rested the man gazing far across the valley
   lying thus he could see a great distance but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion nothing stirred the dusty plain the
   disintegrated sand of longdry riverbeds where once coursed the
   gushing streams of earths youth there was little greenery in this
   ultimate world this final stage of mankinds prolonged presence upon
   the planet for unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had ravaged
   all the lands the trees and bushes had given way to small twisted
   shrubs that persisted long through their sturdiness; but these in
   turn perished before the onslaught of coarse grasses and stringy
   tough vegetation of strange evolution

   the everpresent heat as earth drew nearer to the sun withered and
   killed with pitiless rays it had not come at once; long aeons had gone
   before any could feel the change and all through those first ages
   mans adaptable form had followed the slow mutation and modelled itself
   to fit the more and more torrid air then the day had come when men
   could bear their hot cities but ill and a gradual recession began
   slow yet deliberate those towns and settlements closest to the equator
   had been first of course but later there were others man softened
   and exhausted could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat
   it seared him as he was and evolution was too low to mould new
   resistances in him

   yet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the
   spider and the scorpion in the early years there were many who stayed
   on devising curious shields and armours against the head and the
   deadly dryness these fearless souls screening certain buildings
   against the encroaching sun made miniature worlds of refuge wherein no
   protective armour was needed they contrived marvellously ingenious
   things so that for a while men persisted in the rusting towers hoping
   thereby to cling to old lands till the searing should be over for many
   would not believe what the astronomers said and looked for a coming of
   the mild olden world again but one day the men of dath from the new
   city of niyara made signals to yuanario their immemorially ancient
   capital and gained no answer from the few who remained therein and
   when explorers reached that millennial city of bridgelinked towers
   they found only silence there was not even the horror of corruption
   for the scavenger lizards had been swift

   only then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to
   them; know that they must forever abandon them to nature the other
   colonists in the hot lands fled from their brave posts and total
   silence reigned within the high basalt walls of a thousand empty towns
   of the dense throngs and multitudinous activities of the past nothing
   finally remained there now loomed against the rainless deserts only
   the blistered towers of vacant houses factories and structures of
   every sort reflecting the suns dazzling radiance and parching in the
   more and more intolerable heat

   many lands however had still escaped the scorching blight so that
   the refugees were soon absorbed in the life of a newer world during
   strangely prosperous centuries the hoary deserted cities of the equator
   grew halfforgotten and entwined with fantastic fables few thought of
   those spectral rotting towerthose huddles of shabby walls and
   cactuschoked streets darkly silent and abandoned

   wars came sinful and prolonged but the times of peace were greater
   yet always the swollen sun increased its radiance as earth drew closer
   to its fiery parent it was as if the planet meant to return to that
   source whence it was snatched aeons ago through the accidents of
   cosmic growth

   after a time the blight crept outward from the central belt southern
   yarat burned as a tenantless desertand then the north in perath and
   baling those ancient cities where brooding centuries dwelt there
   moved only the scaly shapes of the serpent and the salamander and at
   last loton echoed only to the fitful falling of tottering spires and
   crumbling domes

   steady universal and inexorable was the great eviction of man from
   the realms he had always known no land within the widening stricken
   belt was spared; no people left unrouted it was an epic a titan
   tragedy whose plot was unrevealed to the actorsthis wholesale
   desertion of the cities of men it took not years or even centuries
   but millennia of ruthless change and still it kept onsullen
   inevitable savagely devastating

   agriculture was at a standstill the world fast became too arid for
   crops this was remedied by artificial substitutes soon universally
   used and as the old places that had known the great things of mortals
   were left the loot salvaged by the fugitives grew smaller and smaller
   things of the greatest value and importance were left in dead
   museumslost amid the centuriesand in the end the heritage of the
   immemorial past was abandoned a degeneracy both physical and cultural
   set in with the insidious heat for man had so long dwelt in comfort
   and security that this exodus from past scenes was difficult nor were
   these events received phlegmatically; their very slowness was
   terrifying degradation and debauchery were soon common; government was
   disorganized and the civilizations aimlessly slid back toward
   barbarism

   when fortynine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt
   the whole western hemisphere was left unpeopled chaos was complete
   there was no trace of order or decency in the last scenes of this
   titanic wildly impressive migration madness and frenzy stalked
   through them and fanatics screamed of an armageddon close at hand

   mankind was now a pitiful remnant of the elder races a fugitive not
   only from the prevailing conditions but from his own degeneracy into
   the northland and the antarctic went those who could; the rest lingered
   for years in an incredible saturnalia vaguely doubting the forthcoming
   disasters in the city of borligo a wholesale execution of the new
   prophets took place after months of unfulfilled expectations they
   thought the flight to the northland unnecessary and looked no longer
   for the threatened ending

   how they perished must have been terrible indeedthose vain foolish
   creatures who thought to defy the universe but the blackened scorched
   towns are mute

   these events however must not be chronicledfor there are larger
   things to consider than this complex and unhastening downfall of a lost
   civilization during a long period morale was at lowest ebb among the
   courageous few who settled upon the alien arctic and antarctic shores
   now mild as were those of southern yarat in the longdead past but
   here there was respite the soil was fertile and forgotten pastoral
   arts were called into use anew there was for a long time a contented
   little epitome of the lost lands; though here were no vast throngs or
   great buildings only a sparse remnant of humanity survived the aeons
   of change and peopled those scattered villages of the later world

   how many millennia this continued is not known the sun was slow in
   invading this last retreat; and as the eras passed there developed a
   sound sturdy race bearing no memories or legends of the old lost
   lands little navigation was practiced by this new people and the
   flying machine was wholly forgotten their devices were of the simplest
   type and their culture was simple and primitive yet they were
   contented and accepted the warm climate as something natural and
   accustomed

   but unknown to these simple peasantfolk still further rigours of
   nature were slowly preparing themselves as the generations passed the
   waters of the vast and unplumbed ocean wasted slowly away; enriching
   the air and the desiccated soil but sinking lower and lower each
   century the splashing surf still glistened bright and the swirling
   eddies were still there but a doom of dryness hung over the whole
   watery expanse however the shrinkage could not have been detected
   save by instruments more delicate than any then known to the race even
   had the people realized the oceans contraction it is not likely that
   any vast alarm or great disturbance would have resulted for the losses
   were so slight and the seas so greatonly a few inches during many
   centuriesbut in many centuries; increasing

   

   so at last the oceans went and water became a rarity on a globe of
   sunbaked drought man had slowly spread over all the arctic and
   antarctic lands; the equatorial cities and many of later habitation
   were forgotten even to legend

   and now again the peace was disturbed for water was scarce and found
   only in deep caverns there was little enough even of this; and men
   died of thirst wandering in far places yet so slow were these deadly
   changes that each new generation of man was loath to believe what it
   heard from its parents none would admit that the head had been less or
   the water more plentiful in the old days or take warning that days of
   bitterer burning and drought were to come thus it was even at the end
   when only a few hundred human creatures panted for breach beneath the
   cruel sun; a piteous huddled handful out of all the unnumbered millions
   who had once dwelt on the doomed planet

   and the hundreds became small till man was to be reckoned only in
   tens these tens clung to the shrinking dampness of the caves and knew
   at last that the end was near so slight was their range that none had
   ever seen the tiny fabled spots of ice left close to the planets
   polesif such indeed remained even had they existed and been known to
   man none could have reached them across the trackless and formidable
   deserts and so the last pathetic few dwindled

   it cannot be described this awesome chain of events that depopulated
   the whole earth; the range is too tremendous for any to picture or
   encompass of the people of earths fortunate ages billions of years
   before only a few prophets and madmen could have conceived that which
   was to comecould have grasped visions of the still dead lands and
   longempty seabeds the rest would have doubteddoubted alike the
   shadow of change upon the planet and the shadow of doom upon the race
   for man has always thought himself the immortal master of natural
   things

ii[edit]

   when he had eased the dying pangs of the old woman ull wandered in a
   fearful daze out into the dazzling sands she had been a fearsome
   thing shrivelled and so dry; like withered leaves her face had been
   the colour of the sickly yellow grasses that rustled in the hot wind
   and she was loathsomely old

   but she had been a companion; someone to stammer out vague fears to to
   talk to about this incredible thing; a comrade to share ones hopes for
   succour from those silent other colonies beyond the mountains he could
   not believe none lived elsewhere for ull was young and not certain as
   are the old

   for many years he had known none but the old womanher name was
   mladdna she had come that day in his eleventh year when all the
   hunters went to seek food and did not return ull had no mother that
   he could remember and there were few women in the tiny group when the
   men vanished those three women the young one and the two old had
   screamed fearfully and moaned long then the young one had gone mad
   and killed herself with a sharp stick the old ones buried her in a
   shallow hole dug with their nails so ull had been alone when this
   still old mladdna came

   she walked with the aid of a knotty pole a priceless relique of the
   old forests hard and shiny with years of use she did not say whence
   she came but stumbled into the cabin while the young suicide was being
   buried there she waited till the two returned and they accepted her
   incuriously

   that was the way it had been for many weeks until the two fell sick
   and mladdna could not cure them strange that those younger two should
   have been stricken while she infirm and ancient lived on mladdna
   had cared for them many days and at length they died so that ull was
   left with only the stranger he screamed all the night so she became
   at length out of patience and threatened to die too then hearkening
   he became quiet at once; for he was not desirous of complete solitude
   after that he lived with mladdna and they gathered roots to eat

   mladdnas rotten teeth were ill suited to the food they gathered but
   they contrived to chop it up till she could manage it this weary
   routine of seeking and eating was ulls childhood

   now he was strong and firm in his nineteenth year and the old woman
   was dead there was naught to stay for so he determined at once to
   seek out those fabled huts beyond the mountains and live with the
   people there there was nothing to take on the journey ull closed the
   door of his cabinwhy he could not have told for no animals had been
   there for many yearsand left the dead woman within halfdazed and
   fearful at his own audacity he walked long hours in the dry grasses
   and at length reached the first of the foothills the afternoon came
   and he climbed until he was weary and lay down on the grasses
   sprawled there he thought of many things he wondered at the strange
   life passionately anxious to seek out the lost colony beyond the
   mountains; but at last he slept

   when he awoke there was starlight on his face and he felt refreshed
   now that the sun was gone for a time he travelled more quickly eating
   little and determining to hasten before the lack of water became
   difficult to bear he had brought none; for the last people dwelling
   in one place and never having occasion to bear their precious water
   away made no vessels of any kind ull hoped to reach his goal within a
   day and thus escape thirst; so he hurried on beneath the bright stars
   running at times in the ear air and at other times lapsing into a
   dogtrot

   so he continued until the sun arose yet still he was within the small
   hills with three great peaks looming ahead in their shade he rested
   again then he climbed all the morning and at midday surmounted the
   first peak where he lay for a time surveying the space before the
   next range

   upon an eroded clifftop rested the man gazing far across the valley
   lying thus he could see a great distance but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion

   the second night came and found ull amid the rough peaks the valley
   and the place where he had rested far behind he was nearly out of the
   second range now and hurrying still thirst had come upon him that
   day and he regretted his folly yet he could not have stayed there
   with the corpse alone in the grasslands he sought to convince himself
   thus and hastened ever on tiredly straining

   and now there were only a few steps before the cliff wall would part
   and allow a view of the land beyond ull stumbled wearily down the
   stony way tumbling and bruising himself even more it was nearly
   before him this land where men were rumoured to have dwelt; this land
   of which he had heard tales in his youth the way was long but the
   goal was great a boulder of giant circumference cut off his view; upon
   this he scrambled anxiously now at last he could behold by the sinking
   orb his longsought destination and his thirst and aching muscles were
   forgotten as he saw joyfully that a small huddle of buildings clung to
   the base of the farther cliff

   ull rested not; but spurred on by what he saw ran and staggered and
   crawled the half mile remaining he fancied that he could detect forms
   among the rude cabins the sun was nearly gone; the hateful
   devastating sun that had slain humanity he could not be sure of
   details but soon the cabins were near

   they were very old for clay blocks lasted long in the still dryness of
   the dying world little indeed changed but the living thingsthe
   grasses and these last men

   before him an open door swung on rude pegs in the fading light ull
   entered weary unto death seeking painfully the expected faces

   then he fell upon the floor and wept for at the table was propped a
   dry and ancient skeleton

   

   he rose at last crazed by thirst aching unbearably and suffering the
   greatest disappointment any mortal could know he was then the last
   living thing upon the globe his the heritage of the earthall the
   lands and all to him equally useless he staggered up not looking at
   the dim white form in the reflected moonlight and went through the
   door about the empty village he wandered spectrally preserved by the
   changeless air here there was a dwelling there a rude place where
   things had been madeclay vessels holding only dust and nowhere any
   liquid to quench his burning thirst

   then in the centre of the little town ull saw a wellcurb he knew
   what it was for he had heard tales of such things from mladdna with
   pitiful joy he reeled forward and leaned upon the edge there at
   last was the end of his search waterslimy stagnant and shallow
   but waterbefore his sight

   ull cried out in the voice of a tortured animal groping for the chain
   and bucket his hand slipped on the slimy edge; and he fell upon his
   chest across the bring for a moment he lay therethen soundlessly his
   body was precipitated down the black shaft

   there was a slight splash in the murky shallowness as he struck some
   longsunken stone dislodged aeons ago from the massive coping the
   disturbed water subsided into quietness

   and now at last the earth was dead the final pitiful survivor had
   perished all the teeming billions; the slow aeons; the empires and
   civilizations of mankind were summed up in this poor twisted formand
   how titanically meaningless it had all been! now indeed had come and
   end and climax to all the efforts of humanityhow monstrous and
   incredible a climax in the eyes of those poor complacent fools in the
   prosperous days! not ever again would the planet know the thunderous
   tramping of human millionsor even the crawling of lizards and the
   buzz of insects for they too had gone now was come the reign of
   sapless branches and endless fields of tough grasses earth like its
   cold imperturbable moon was given over to silence and blackness
   forever

   the stars whirled on; the whole careless plan would continue for
   infinities unknown this trivial end of a negligible episode mattered
   not to distant nebulae or to suns newborn flourishing and dying the
   race of man too puny and momentary to have a real function or purpose
   was as if it had never existed to such a conclusion the aeons of its
   farcically toilsome evolution had led

   but when the deadly suns first rays darted across the valley a light

   a timeblack tower against dim banks of cloud;
         around its base the pathless pressing wood
   shadow and silence moss and mould enshroud
         grey agefelld slabs that once as cromlechs stood
   no fall of foot no song of bird awakes
         the lethal aisles of sempiternal night
   tho oft with stir of wings the dense air shakes
         as in the tower there glows a pallid light
   for here apart dwells one whose hands have wrought
         strange eidola that chill the world with fear;
   whose graven runes in tones of dread have taught
         what things beyond the stargulfs lurk and leer
   dark lord of averoignewhose windows stare
   on pits of dream no other gaze could bear!

   dunsanyh p lovecraft

   as when the sun above a dusky wold
   springs into sight and turns the gloom to gold
   lights with his magic beams the dewdeckd bowr
   and wakes to life the gay responsive flowr;
   so now oer realms where darkning dulness lies
   in solar state see shining plunkett rise!
   monarch of fancy! whose ethereal mind
   mounts fairy peaks and leaves the throng behind;
   whose soul untainted bursts the bounds of space
   and leads to regions of supernal grace:
   can any praise thee with too strong a tone
   who in this age of folly gleamd alone?
   thy quill dunsany with an art divine
   recalls the gods to each deserted shrine;
   from mystic air a novel pantheon makes
   and with new spirits fills the meads and brakes;
   with thee we wander thro primeval bowrs
   for thou hast brought earths childhood back and ours!
   how leaps the soul with sudden bliss increasd
   when led by thee to lands beyond the east!
   sick of this sphere in crime and conflict old
   we yearn for wonders distant and untold;
   oer homers page a second time we pore
   and rack our brains for gleams of infant lore:
   but all in vainfor valiant tho we strive
   no common means these pictures can revive
   then dawns dunsany with celestial light
   and fulgent visions break upon our sight:
   his barque enchanted each sad spirit bears
   to shores of gold beyond the reach of cares
   no earthly trammels now our thoughts may chain;
   for childhoods fancy hath come back again!
   what glittring worlds now wait our eager eyes!
   what roads untrodden beckon thro the skies!
   wonders on wonders line the gorgeous ways
   and glorious vistas greet the ravishd gaze;
   mountains of clouds castles of crystal dreams
   ethereal cities and elysian streams;
   temples of blue where myriad stars adore
   forgotten gods of aeons gone before!
   such are thine arts dunsany such thy skill
   that scarce terrestrial seems thy moving quill;
   can man and man alone successful draw
   such scenes of wonder and domains of awe?
   our hearts enrapturd fix thy minds abode
   in high pegana: hail thee as a god;
   and sure can aught more high or godlike be
   than such a fancy as resides in thee?
   delighted pan a friend and peer perceives
   as thy sweet music stirs the sylvan leaves;
   the nine transported bless thy golden lyre:
   approve thy fancy and applaud thy fire;
   whilst jove himself assumes a brothers tone
   and vows the pantheon equal to his own
   dunsany may thy days be glad and long;
   replete with visions and atune with song;
   may thy rare notes increasing millions cheer
   thy name beloved and thy memry dear!
   tis thou who hast in hours of dulness brought
   new charms of language and new gems of thought;
   hast with a poets grace enrichd the earth
   with aureate dreams as noble as thy birth
   grateful we name thee bright with fixd renown
   the fairest jewel in hibernias crown

   dead passions flame

   a pome by blank frailty

   ah passion like a voice  that buds!
   with many thornsthat sharply stick:
   recalls to me the longing of our bloods
   and  makes my wearied heart requick! 

   arcadia

   by head balledup

   o give me the life of the village
       uninhibited free and sweet
   the place where the arts all flourish
       grove court and christopher street

   i am sick of the old conventions
       and critics who will not praise
   so sing ho for the open spaces
       and aesthetes with kindly ways

   here every bard is a genius
       and artists are raphaels
   and above the roofs of patchin place
       the muse of talent dwells

   not all of the few remaining inhabitants of daalbergen that dismal
   little village in the ramapo mountains believe that my uncle old
   dominie vanderhoof is really dead some of them believe he is
   suspended somewhere between heaven and hell because of the old sextons
   curse if it had not been for that old magician he might still be
   preaching in the little damp church across the moor after what has
   happened to me in daalbergen i can almost share the opinion of the
   villagers i am not sure that my uncle is dead but i am very sure that
   he is not alive upon this earth there is no doubt that the old sexton
   buried him once but he is not in that grave now i can almost feel him
   behind me as i write impelling me to tell the truth about those
   strange happenings in daalbergen so many years ago it was the fourth
   day of october when i arrived at daalbergen in answer to a summons the
   letter was from a former member of my uncles congregation who wrote
   that the old man had passed away and that there should be some small
   estate which i as his only living relative might inherit having
   reached the secluded little hamlet by a wearying series of changes on
   branch railways i found my way to the grocery store of mark haines
   writer of the letter and he leading me into a stuffy back room told
   me a peculiar tale concerning dominie vanderhoofs death y should be
   careful hoffman haines told me when y meet that old sexton abel
   foster hes in league with the devil sures youre alive twant
   two weeks ago sam pryor when he passed the old graveyard heared him
   mumblin t the dead there twant right he should talk that wayan
   sam does vow that there was a voice answered hima kind o halfvoice
   hollow and muffledlike as though it come out o th ground theres
   others too as could tell y about seein him standin afore old
   dominie slotts gravethat one right agin the church wallawringin
   his hands an atalkin t th moss on th tombstone as though it was
   the old dominie himself old foster haines said had come to
   daalbergen about ten years before and had been immediately engaged by
   vanderhoof to take care of the damp stone church at which most of the
   villagers worshipped no one but vanderhoof seemed to like him for his
   presence brought a suggestion almost of the uncanny he would sometimes
   stand by the door when the people came to church and the men would
   coldly return his servile bow while the women brushed past in haste
   holding their skirts aside to avoid touching him he could be seen on
   week days cutting the grass in the cemetery and tending the flowers
   around the graves now and then crooning and muttering to himself and
   few failed to notice the particular attention he paid to the grave of
   the reverend guilliam slott first pastor of the church in 1701 it was
   not long after fosters establishment as a village fixture that
   disaster began to lower first came the failure of the mountain mine
   where most of the men worked the vein of iron had given out and many
   of the people moved away to better localities while those who had
   large holdings of land in the vicinity took to farming and managed to
   wrest a meager living from the rocky hillsides then came the
   disturbances in the church it was whispered about that the reverend
   johannes vanderhoof had made a compact with the devil and was
   preaching his word in the house of god his sermons had become weird
   and grotesqueredolent with sinister things which the ignorant people
   of daalbergen did not understand he transported them back over ages of
   fear and superstition to regions of hideous unseen spirits and
   peopled their fancy with nighthaunting ghouls one by one the
   congregation dwindled while the elders and deacons vainly pleaded with
   vanderhoof to change the subject of his sermons though the old man
   continually promised to comply he seemed to be enthralled by some
   higher power which forced him to do its will a giant in stature
   johannes vanderhoof was known to be weak and timid at heart yet even
   when threatened with expulsion he continued his eerie sermons until
   scarcely a handful of people remained to listen to him on sunday
   morning because of weak finances it was found impossible to call a
   new pastor and before long not one of the villagers dared venture near
   the church or the parsonage which adjoined it everywhere there was
   fear of those spectral wraiths with whom vanderhoof was apparently in
   league my uncle mark haines told me had continued to live in the
   parsonage because there was no one with sufficient courage to tell him
   to move out of it no one ever saw him again but lights were visible
   in the parsonage at night and were even glimpsed in the church from
   time to time it was whispered about the town that vanderhoof preached
   regularly in the church every sunday morning unaware that his
   congregation was no longer there to listen he had only the old sexton
   who lived in the basement of the church to take care of him and
   foster made a weekly visit to what remained of the business section of
   the village to buy provisions he no longer bowed servilely to everyone
   he met but instead seemed to harbor a demoniac and illconcealed
   hatred he spoke to no one except as was necessary to make his
   purchases and glanced from left to right out of evilfilled eyes as he
   walked the street with his cane tapping the uneven pavements bent and
   shriveled with extreme age his presence could actually be felt by
   anyone near him so powerful was that personality which said the
   townspeople had made vanderhoof accept the devil as his master no
   person in daalbergen doubted that abel foster was at the bottom of all
   the towns ill luck but not a one dared lift a finger against him or
   could even approach him without a tremor of fear his name as well as
   vanderhoofs was never mentioned aloud whenever the matter of the
   church across the moor was discussed it was in whispers; and if the
   conversation chanced to be nocturnal the whisperers would keep
   glancing over their shoulders to make sure that nothing shapeless or
   sinister crept out of the darkness to bear witness to their words the
   churchyard continued to be kept just as green and beautiful as when the
   church was in use and the flowers near the graves in the cemetery were
   tended just as carefully as in times gone by the old sexton could
   occasionally be seen working there as if still being paid for his
   services and those who dared venture near said that he maintained a
   continual conversation with the devil and with those spirits which
   lurked within the graveyard walls one morning haines went on to say
   foster was seen digging a grave where the steeple of the church throws
   its shadow in the afternoon before the sun goes down behind the
   mountain and puts the entire village in semitwilight later the
   church bell silent for months tolled solemnly for a halfhour and at
   sundown those who were watching from a distance saw foster bring a
   coffin from the parsonage on a wheelbarrow dump it into the grave with
   slender ceremony and replace the earth in the hole the sexton came to
   the village the next morning ahead of his usual weekly schedule and
   in much better spirits than was customary he seemed willing to talk
   remarking that vanderhoof had died the day before and that he had
   buried his body beside that of dominie slott near the church wall he
   smiled from time to time and rubbed his hands in an untimely and
   unaccountable glee it was apparent that he took a perverse and
   diabolic delight in vanderhoofs death the villagers were conscious of
   an added uncanniness in his presence and avoided him as much as they
   could with vanderhoof gone they felt more insecure than ever for the
   old sexton was now free to cast his worst spells over the town from the
   church across the moor muttering something in a tongue which no one
   understood foster made his way back along the road over the swamp it
   was then it seems that mark haines remembered having heard dominie
   vanderhoof speak of me as his nephew haines accordingly sent for me
   in the hope that i might know something which would clear up the
   mystery of my uncles last years i assured my summoner however that
   i knew nothing about my uncle or his past except that my mother had
   mentioned him as a man of gigantic physique but with little courage or
   power of will having heard all that haines had to tell me i lowered
   the front legs of my chair to the floor and looked at my watch it was
   late afternoon how far is it out to the church? i inquired think i
   can make it before sunset? sure lad y aint goin out there
   tnight! not t that place! the old man trembled noticeably in every
   limb and half rose from his chair stretching out a lean detaining
   hand why its plumb foolishness! he exclaimed i laughed aside his
   fears and informed him that come what may i was determined to see the
   old sexton that evening and get the whole matter over as soon as
   possible i did not intend to accept the superstitions of ignorant
   country folk as truth for i was convinced that all i had just heard
   was merely a chain of events which the overimaginative people of
   daalbergen had happened to link with their illluck i felt no sense of
   fear or horror whatever seeing that i was determined to reach my
   uncles house before nightfall haines ushered me out of his office and
   reluctantly gave me the few required directions pleading from time to
   time that i change my mind he shook my hand when i left as though he
   never expected to see me again take keer that old devil foster
   dont git ye! he warned again and again i wouldnt go near him
   after dark fer love nr money no siree! he reentered his store
   solemnly shaking his head while i set out along a road leading to the
   outskirts of the town i had walked barely two minutes before i sighted
   the moor of which haines had spoken the road flanked by a whitewashed
   fence passed over the great swamp which was overgrown with clumps of
   underbrush dipping down into the dank slimy ooze an odor of deadness
   and decay filled the air and even in the sunlit afternoon little wisps
   of vapor could be seen rising from the unhealthful spot on the
   opposite side of the moor i turned sharply to the left as i had been
   directed branching from the main road there were several houses in
   the vicinity i noticed; houses which were scarcely more than huts
   reflecting the extreme poverty of their owners the road here passed
   under the drooping branches of enormous willows which almost completely
   shut out the rays of the sun the miasmal odor of the swamp was still
   in my nostrils and the air was damp and chilly i hurried my pace to
   get out of that dismal tunnel as soon as possible presently i found
   myself in the light again the sun now hanging like a red ball upon
   the crest of the mountain was beginning to dip low and there some
   distance ahead of me bathed in its bloody iridescence stood the
   lonely church i began to sense that uncanniness which haines had
   mentioned; that feeling of dread which made all daalbergen shun the
   place the squat stone hulk of the church itself with its blunt
   steeple seemed like an idol to which the tombstones that surrounded it
   bowed down and worshipped each with an arched top like the shoulders
   of a kneeling person while over the whole assemblage the dingy gray
   parsonage hovered like a wraith i had slowed my pace a trifle as i
   took in the scene the sun was disappearing behind the mountain very
   rapidly now and the damp air chilled me turning my coat collar up
   about my neck i plodded on something caught my eye as i glanced up
   again in the shadow of the church wall was something whitea thing
   which seemed to have no definite shape straining my eyes as i came
   nearer i saw that it was a cross of new timber surmounting a mound of
   freshly turned earth the discovery sent a new chill through me i
   realized that this must be my uncles grave but something told me that
   it was not like the other graves near it it did not seem like a dead
   grave in some intangible way it appeared to be living if a grave can
   be said to live very close to it i saw as i came nearer was another
   grave; an old mound with a crumbling stone about it dominie slotts
   tomb i thought remembering hainess story there was no sign of life
   anywhere about the place in the semitwilight i climbed the low knoll
   upon which the parsonage stood and hammered upon the door there was
   no answer i skirted the house and peered into the windows the whole
   place seemed deserted the lowering mountains had made night fall with
   disarming suddenness the minute the sun was fully hidden i realized
   that i could see scarcely more than a few feet ahead of me feeling my
   way carefully i rounded a corner of the house and paused wondering
   what to do next everything was quiet there was not a breath of wind
   nor were there even the usual noises made by animals in their nocturnal
   ramblings all dread had been forgotten for a time but in the presence
   of that sepulchral calm my apprehensions returned i imagined the air
   peopled with ghastly spirits that pressed around me making the air
   almost unbreathable i wondered for the hundredth time where the old
   sexton might be as i stood there half expecting some sinister demon
   to creep from the shadows i noticed two lighted windows glaring from
   the belfry of the church i then remembered what haines had told me
   about fosters living in the basement of the building advancing
   cautiously through the blackness i found a side door of the church
   ajar the interior had a musty and mildewed odor everything i touched
   was covered with a cold clammy moisture i struck a match and began to
   explore to discover if i could how to get into the belfry suddenly
   i stopped in my tracks a snatch of song loud and obscene sung in a
   voice that was guttural and thick with drink came from above me the
   match burned my fingers and i dropped it two pinpoints of light
   pierced the darkness of the farther wall of the church and below them
   to one side i could see a door outlined where light filtered through
   its cracks the song stopped as abruptly as it had commenced and there
   was absolute silence again my heart was thumping and blood racing
   through my temples had i not been petrified with fear i should have
   fled immediately not caring to light another match i felt my way
   among the pews until i stood in front of the door so deep was the
   feeling of depression which had come over me that i felt as though i
   were acting in a dream my actions were almost involuntary the door
   was locked as i found when i turned the knob i hammered upon it for
   some time but there was no answer the silence was as complete as
   before feeling around the edge of the door i found the hinges
   removed the pins from them and allowed the door to fall toward me dim
   light flooded down a steep flight of steps there was a sickening odor
   of whisky i could now hear someone stirring in the belfry room above
   venturing a low halloo i thought i heard a groan in reply and
   cautiously climbed the stairs my first glance into that unhallowed
   place was indeed startling strewn about the little room were old and
   dusty books and manuscriptsstrange things that bespoke almost
   unbelievable age on rows of shelves which reached to the ceiling were
   horrible things in glass jars and bottlessnakes and lizards and bats
   dust and mold and cobwebs encrusted everything in the center behind a
   table upon which was a lighted candle a nearly empty bottle of whisky
   and a glass was a motionless figure with a thin scrawny wrinkled
   face and wild eyes that stared blankly through me i recognized abel
   foster the old sexton in an instant he did not move or speak as i
   came slowly and fearfully toward him mr foster? i asked trembling
   with unaccountable fear when i heard my voice echo within the close
   confines of the room there was no reply and no movement from the
   figure behind the table i wondered if he had not drunk himself to
   insensibility and went behind the table to shake him at the mere
   touch of my arm upon his shoulder the strange old man started from his
   chair as though terrified his eyes still having in them that same
   blank stare were fixed upon me swinging his arms like flails he
   backed away dont! he screamed dont touch me! go backgo back!
   i saw that he was both drunk and struck with some kind of a nameless
   terror using a soothing tone i told him who i was and why i had come
   he seemed to understand vaguely and sank back into his chair sitting
   limp and motionless i thought ye was him he mumbled i thought ye
   was him come back fer it hes been atryin t get outatryin t
   get out sence i put him in there his voice again rose to a scream and
   he clutched his chair maybe hes got out now! maybe hes out! i
   looked about half expecting to see some spectral shape coming up the
   stairs maybe whos out? i inquired vanderhoof! he shrieked th
   cross over his grave keeps fallin down in th night! every morning the
   earth is loose and gets harder t pat down hell come out an i wont
   be able t do nothin forcing him back into the chair i seated
   myself on a box near him he was trembling in mortal terror with the
   saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth from time to time i felt
   that sense of horror which haines had described when he told me of the
   old sexton truly there was something uncanny about the man his head
   had now sunk forward upon his breast and he seemed calmer mumbling to
   himself i quietly arose and opened a window to let out the fumes of
   whisky and the musty odor of dead things light from a dim moon just
   risen made objects below barely visible i could just see dominie
   vanderhoofs grave from my position in the belfry and blinked my eyes
   as i gazed at it that cross was tilted! i remembered that it had been
   vertical an hour ago fear took possession of me again i turned
   quickly foster sat in his chair watching me his glance was saner than
   before so yere vanderhoofs nephew he mumbled in a nasal tone
   waal ye mights well know it all hell be back after me afore long
   he willjus as soon as he can get out o that there grave ye mights
   well know all about it now his terror appeared to have left him he
   seemed resigned to some horrible fate which he expected any minute his
   head dropped down upon his chest again and he went on muttering in
   that nasal monotone ye see all them there books and papers? waal
   they was once dominie slottsdominie slott who was here years ago
   all them things is got t do with magicblack magic that th old
   dominie knew afore he come t this country they used t burn em an
   boil em in oil fer knowin that over there they did but old slott
   knew and he didnt go fer t tell nobody no sir old slott used to
   preach here generations ago an he used to come up here an study them
   books an use all them dead things in jars an pronounce magic curses
   an things but he didnt let nobody know it no nobody knowed it but
   dominie slott an me you? i ejaculated leaning across the table
   toward him that is me after i learned it his face showed lines of
   trickery as he answered me i found all this stuff here when i come t
   be church sexton an i used t read it when i want at work an i
   soon got t know all about it the old man droned on while i
   listened spellbound he told about learning the difficult formulae of
   demonology so that by means of incantations he could cast spells
   over human beings he had performed horrible occult rites of his
   hellish creed calling down anathema upon the town and its inhabitants
   crazed by his desires he tried to bring the church under his spell
   but the power of god was too strong finding johannes vanderhoof very
   weakwilled he bewitched him so that he preached strange and mystic
   sermons which struck fear into the simple hearts of the country folk
   from his position in the belfry room he said behind a painting of the
   temptation of christ which adorned the rear wall of the church he
   would glare at vanderhoof while he was preaching through holes which
   were the eyes of the devil in the picture terrified by the uncanny
   things which were happening in their midst the congregation left one
   by one and foster was able to do what he pleased with the church and
   with vanderhoof but what did you do with him? i asked in a hollow
   voice as the old sexton paused in his confession he burst into a
   cackle of laughter throwing back his head in drunken glee i took his
   soul! he howled in a tone that set me trembling i took his soul and
   put it in a bottlein a little black bottle! and i buried him! but he
   aint got his soul an he caint go neither t heaven nr hell! but
   hes acomin back after it hes atrying t get out o his grave
   now i can hear him pushin his way up through the ground hes that
   strong! as the old man had proceeded with his story i had become more
   and more convinced that he must be telling me the truth and not merely
   gibbering in drunkenness every detail fitted what haines had told me
   fear was growing upon me by degrees with the old wizard now shouting
   with demoniac laughter i was tempted to bolt down the narrow stairway
   and leave that accursed neighborhood to calm myself i rose and again
   looked out of the window my eyes nearly started from their sockets
   when i saw that the cross above vanderhoofs grave had fallen
   perceptibly since i had last looked at it it was now tilted to an
   angle of fortyfive degrees! cant we dig up vanderhoof and restore
   his soul? i asked almost breathlessly feeling that something must be
   done in a hurry the old man rose from his chair in terror no no
   no! he screamed hed kill me! ive fergot th formula an if he
   gets out hell be alive without a soul hed kill us both! where is
   the bottle that contains his soul? i asked advancing threateningly
   toward him i felt that some ghastly thing was about to happen which i
   must do all in my power to prevent i wont tell ye ye young whelp!
   he snarled i felt rather than saw a queer light in his eyes as he
   backed into a corner an dont ye touch me either or yell wish ye
   hadnt! i moved a step forward noticing that on a low stool behind
   him there were two black bottles foster muttered some peculiar words
   in a low singsong voice everything began to turn gray before my eyes
   and something within me seemed to be dragged upward trying to get out
   at my throat i felt my knees become weak lurching forward i caught
   the old sexton by the throat and with my free arm reached for the
   bottles on the stool but the old man fell backward striking the stool
   with his foot and one bottle fell to the floor as i snatched the
   other there was a flash of blue flame and a sulfurous smell filled
   the room from the little heap of broken glass a white vapor rose and
   followed the draft out the window curse ye ye rascal! sounded a
   voice that seemed faint and far away foster whom i had released when
   the bottle broke was crouching against the wall looking smaller and
   more shriveled than before his face was slowly turning greenishblack
   curse ye! said the voice again hardly sounding as though it came
   from his lips im done fer! that one in there was mine! dominie slott
   took it out two hundred years ago! he slid slowly toward the floor
   gazing at me with hatred in eyes that were rapidly dimming his flesh
   changed from white to black and then to yellow i saw with horror that
   his body seemed to be crumbling away and his clothing falling into limp
   folds the bottle in my hand was growing warm i glanced at it
   fearfully it glowed with a faint phosphorescence stiff with fright i
   set it upon the table but could not keep my eyes from it there was an
   ominous moment of silence as its glow became brighter and then there
   came distinctly to my ears the sound of sliding earth gasping for
   breath i looked out of the window the moon was now well up in the
   sky and by its light i could see that the fresh cross above
   vanderhoofs grave had completely fallen once again there came the
   sound of trickling gravel and no longer able to control myself i
   stumbled down the stairs and found my way out of doors falling now and
   then as i raced over the uneven ground i ran on in abject terror when
   i had reached the foot of the knoll at the entrance to that gloomy
   tunnel beneath the willows i heard a horrible roar behind me turning
   i glanced back toward the church its wall reflected the light of the
   moon and silhouetted against it was a gigantic loathsome black
   shadow climbing from my uncles grave and floundering gruesomely toward
   the church i told my story to a group of villagers in hainess store
   the next morning they looked from one to the other with little smiles
   during my tale i noticed but when i suggested that they accompany me
   to the spot gave various excuses for not caring to go though there
   seemed to be a limit to their credulity they cared to run no risks i
   informed them that i would go alone though i must confess that the
   project did not appeal to me as i left the store one old man with a
   long white beard hurried after me and caught my arm ill go wi ye
   lad he said it do seem that i once heared my granpap tell o
   suthin o the sort concernin old dominie slott a queer old man ive
   heared he were but vanderhoofs been worse dominie vanderhoofs
   grave was open and deserted when we arrived of course it could have
   been graverobbers the two of us agreed and yet    in the belfry
   the bottle which i had left upon the table was gone though the
   fragments of the broken one were found on the floor and upon the heap
   of yellow dust and crumpled clothing that had once been abel foster
   were certain immense footprints after glancing at some of the books
   and papers strewn about the belfry room we carried them down the
   stairs and burned them as something unclean and unholy with a spade
   which we found in the church basement we filled in the grave of
   johannes vanderhoof and as an afterthought flung the fallen cross
   upon the flames old wives say that now when the moon is full there
   walks about the churchyard a gigantic and bewildered figure clutching a
   bottle and seeking some unremembered goal

   mystery attracts mystery ever since the wide appearance of my name as
   a performer of unexplained feats i have encountered strange narratives
   and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests
   and activities some of these have been trivial and irrelevant some
   deeply dramatic and absorbing some productive of weird and perilous
   experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and
   historical research many of these matters i have told and shall
   continue to tell very freely; but there is one of which i speak with
   great reluctance and which i am now relating only after a session of
   grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine who had heard
   vague rumors of it from other members of my family

   the hitherto guarded subject pertains to my nonprofessional visit to
   egypt fourteen years ago and has been avoided by me for several
   reasons for one thing i am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably
   actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists
   who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much
   diligence by the authorities at cairo who cannot be wholly ignorant of
   them for another thing i dislike to recount an incident in which my
   own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part what i
   sawor thought i sawcertainly did not take place; but is rather to
   be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in egyptology and of
   the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally
   prompted these imaginative stimuli magnified by the excitement of an
   actual event terrible enough in itself undoubtedly gave rise to the
   culminating horror of that grotesque night so long past

   in january 1910 i had finished a professional engagement in england
   and signed a contract for a tour of australian theatres a liberal time
   being allowed for the trip i determined to make the most of it in the
   sort of travel which chiefly interests me; so accompanied by my wife i
   drifted pleasantly down the continent and embarked at marseilles on the
   p & o steamer malwa bound for port said from that point i proposed to
   visit the principal historical localities of lower egypt before leaving
   finally for australia

   the voyage was an agreeable one and enlivened by many of the amusing
   incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work i had
   intended for the sake of quiet travel to keep my name a secret; but
   was goaded into betraying myself by a fellowmagician whose anxiety to
   astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and
   exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito i
   mention this because of its ultimate effectan effect i should have
   foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter
   throughout the nile valley what it did was to herald my identity
   wherever i subsequently went and deprive my wife and me of all the
   placid inconspicuousness we had sought traveling to seek curiosities
   i was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself!

   we had come to egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically
   impressive but found little enough when the ship edged up to port said
   and discharged its passengers in small boats low dunes of sand
   bobbing buoys in shallow water and a drearily european small town with
   nothing of interest save the great de lesseps statue made us anxious
   to get to something more worth our while after some discussion we
   decided to proceed at once to cairo and the pyramids later going to
   alexandria for the australian boat and for whatever grecoroman sights
   that ancient metropolis might present

   the railway journey was tolerable enough and consumed only four hours
   and a half we saw much of the suez canal whose route we followed as
   far as ismailiya and later had a taste of old egypt in our glimpse of
   the restored freshwater canal of the middle empire then at last we
   saw cairo glimmering through the growing dusk; a winkling constellation
   which became a blaze as we halted at the great gare centrale

   but once more disappointment awaited us for all that we beheld was
   european save the costumes and the crowds a prosaic subway led to a
   square teeming with carriages taxicabs and trolleycars and gorgeous
   with electric lights shining on tall buildings; whilst the very theatre
   where i was vainly requested to play and which i later attended as a
   spectator had recently been renamed the american cosmograph we
   stopped at shepheards hotel reached in a taxi that sped along broad
   smartly builtup streets; and amidst the perfect service of its
   restaurant elevators and generally angloamerican luxuries the
   mysterious east and immemorial past seemed very far away

   the next day however precipitated us delightfully into the heart of
   the arabian nights atmosphere; and in the winding ways and exotic
   skyline of cairo the bagdad of harunalrashid seemed to live again
   guided by our baedeker we had struck east past the ezbekiyeh gardens
   along the mouski in quest of the native quarter and were soon in the
   hands of a clamorous cicerone whonotwithstanding later
   developmentswas assuredly a master at his trade

   not until afterward did i see that i should have applied at the hotel
   for a licensed guide this man a shaven peculiarly hollowvoiced and
   relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a pharaoh and called himself
   abdul reis el drogman appeared to have much power over others of his
   kind; though subsequently the police professed not to know him and to
   suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority whilst
   drogman is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word
   for a leader of tourist partiesdragoman

   abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed
   of old cairo is itself a storybook and a dreamlabyrinths of narrow
   alleys redolent of aromatic secrets; arabesque balconies and oriels
   nearly meeting above the cobbled streets; maelstroms of oriental
   traffic with strange cries cracking whips rattling carts jingling
   money and braying donkeys; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes veils
   turbans and tarbushes; watercarriers and dervishes dogs and cats
   soothsayers and barbers; and over all the whining of blind beggars
   crouched in alcoves and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from
   minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep unchanging blue

   the roofed quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring spice perfume
   incense beads rugs silks and brassold mahmoud suleiman squats
   crosslegged amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize
   mustard in the hollowedout capital of an ancient classic columna
   roman corinthian perhaps from neighboring heliopolis where augustus
   stationed one of his three egyptian legions antiquity begins to mingle
   with exoticism and then the mosques and the museumwe saw them all
   and tried not to let our arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of
   pharaonic egypt which the museums priceless treasures offered that
   was to be our climax and for the present we concentrated on the
   mediaeval saracenic glories of the califs whose magnificent
   tombmosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the
   arabian desert

   at length abdul took us along the sharia mohammed ali to the ancient
   mosque of sultan hassan and the towerflanked babelazab beyond which
   climbs the steepwalled pass to the mighty citadel that saladin himself
   built with the stones of forgotten pyramids it was sunset when we
   scaled that cliff circled the modern mosque of mohammed ali and
   looked down from the dizzy parapet over mystic cairomystic cairo all
   golden with its carven domes its ethereal minarets and its flaming
   gardens

   far over the city towered the great roman dome of the new museum; and
   beyond itacross the cryptic yellow nile that is the mother of eons
   and dynastieslurked the menacing sands of the libyan desert undulant
   and iridescent and evil with older arcana

   the red sun sank low bringing the relentless chill of egyptian dusk;
   and as it stood poised on the worlds rim like that ancient god of
   heliopolisreharakhte the horizonsunwe saw silhouetted against
   its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the pyramids of gizehthe
   palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when
   tutankhamen mounted his golden throne in distant thebes then we knew
   that we were done with saracen cairo and that we must taste the deeper
   mysteries of primal egyptthe black kem of re and amen isis and
   osiris

   the next morning we visited the pyramids riding out in a victoria
   across the island of chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees and the
   smaller english bridge to the western shore down the shore road we
   drove between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast zoological
   gardens to the suburb of gizeh where a new bridge to cairo proper has
   since been built then turning inland along the shariaelharam we
   crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till
   before us loomed the objects of our quest cleaving the mists of dawn
   and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools forty centuries
   as napoleon had told his campaigners there indeed looked down upon us

   the road now rose abruptly till we finally reached our place of
   transfer between the trolley station and the mena house hotel abdul
   reis who capably purchased our pyramid tickets seemed to have an
   understanding with the crowding yelling and offensive bedouins who
   inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously
   assailed every traveler; for he kept them very decently at bay and
   secured an excellent pair of camels for us himself mounting a donkey
   and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys
   more expensive than useful the area to be traversed was so small that
   camels were hardly needed but we did not regret adding to our
   experience this troublesome form of desert navigation

   the pyramids stand on a high rock plateau this group forming next to
   the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries
   built in the neighborhood of the extinct capital memphis which lay on
   the same side of the nile somewhat south of gizeh and which
   flourished between 3400 and 2000 bc the greatest pyramid which lies
   nearest the modern road was built by king cheops or khufu about 2800
   bc and stands more than 450 feet in perpendicular height in a line
   southwest from this are successively the second pyramid built a
   generation later by king khephren and though slightly smaller looking
   even larger because set on higher ground and the radically smaller
   third pyramid of king mycerinus built about 2700 bc near the edge of
   the plateau and due east of the second pyramid with a face probably
   altered to form a colossal portrait of khephren its royal restorer
   stands the monstrous sphinxmute sardonic and wise beyond mankind
   and memory

   minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in
   several places and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of
   dignitaries of less than royal rank these latter were originally
   marked by mastabas or stone benchlike structures about the deep
   burial shafts as found in other memphian cemeteries and exemplified by
   pernebs tomb in the metropolitan museum of new york at gizeh
   however all such visible things have been swept away by time and
   pillage; and only the rockhewn shafts either sandfilled or cleared
   out by archaeologists remain to attest their former existence
   connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives
   offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or vital principle of the
   deceased the small tombs have their chapels contained in their stone
   mastabas or superstructures but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids
   where regal pharaohs lay were separate temples each to the east of
   its corresponding pyramid and connected by a causeway to a massive
   gatechapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau

   the gatechapel leading to the second pyramid nearly buried in the
   drifting sands yawns subterraneously southeast of the sphinx
   persistent tradition dubs it the temple of the sphinx; and it may
   perhaps be rightly called such if the sphinx indeed represents the
   second pyramids builder khephren there are unpleasant tales of the
   sphinx before khephrenbut whatever its elder features were the
   monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus
   without fear

   it was in the great gatewaytemple that the lifesize diorite statue of
   khephren now in the cairo museum was found; a statue before which i
   stood in awe when i beheld it whether the whole edifice is now
   excavated i am not certain but in 1910 most of it was below ground
   with the entrance heavily barred at night germans were in charge of
   the work and the war or other things may have stopped them i would
   give much in view of my experience and of certain bedouin whisperings
   discredited or unknown in cairo to know what has developed in
   connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of
   the pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of
   baboons

   the road as we traversed it on our camels that morning curved sharply
   past the wooden police quarters post office drug store and shops on
   the left and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the
   rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee
   of the great pyramid past cyclopean masonry we rode rounding the
   eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids
   beyond which the eternal nile glistened to the east and the eternal
   desert shimmered to the west very close loomed the three major
   pyramids the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of
   great stones but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted
   covering which had made them smooth and finished in their day

   presently we descended toward the sphinx and sat silent beneath the
   spell of those terrible unseeing eyes on the vast stone breast we
   faintly discerned the emblem of reharakhte for whose image the sphinx
   was mistaken in a late dynasty; and though sand covered the tablet
   between the great paws we recalled what thutmosis iv inscribed
   thereon and the dream he had when a prince it was then that the smile
   of the sphinx vaguely displeased us and made us wonder about the
   legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature
   leading down down to depths none might dare hint atdepths connected
   with mysteries older than the dynastic egypt we excavate and having a
   sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal animalheaded gods in
   the ancient nilotic pantheon then too it was i asked myself in idle
   question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour

   other tourists now began to overtake us and we moved on to the
   sandchoked temple of the sphinx fifty yards to the southeast which i
   have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the
   second pyramids mortuary chapel on the plateau most of it was still
   underground and although we dismounted and descended through a modern
   passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall i felt that
   abdul and the local german attendant had not shown us all there was to
   see

   after this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau
   examining the second pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary
   chapel to the east the third pyramid and its miniature southern
   satellites and ruined eastern chapel the rock tombs and the
   honeycombings of the fourth and fifth dynasties and the famous
   campbells tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for fiftythree
   feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested
   of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope

   cries now assailed us from the great pyramid where bedouins were
   besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance
   of solitary trips up and down seven minutes is said to be the record
   for such an ascent and descent but many lusty sheiks and sons of
   sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite
   impetus of liberal baksheesh they did not get this impetus though we
   did let abdul take us up thus obtaining a view of unprecedented
   magnificence which included not only remote and glittering cairo with
   its crowned citadel back ground of goldviolet hills but all the
   pyramids of the memphian district as well from abu roash on the north
   to the dashur on the south the sakkara steppyramid which marks the
   evolution of the low mastaba into the true pyramid showed clearly and
   alluringly in the sandy distance it is close to this
   transitionmonument that the famed tomb of perneb was foundmore than
   four hundred miles north of the theban rock valley where tutankhamen
   sleeps again i was forced to silence through sheer awe the prospect
   of such antiquity and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold
   and brood over filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity
   nothing else ever gave me

   fatigued by our climb and disgusted with the importunate bedouins
   whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste we omitted the
   arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the
   pyramids though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for
   the suffocating crawl through cheops mightiest memorial as we
   dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to cairo with
   abdul reis under the afternoon sun we half regretted the omission we
   had made such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid
   passages not in the guide books; passages whose entrances had been
   hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative
   archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them

   of course this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it; but
   it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to
   enter the pyramids at night or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt
   of the great pyramid perhaps in the latter case it was the
   psychological effect which was fearedthe effect on the visitor of
   feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry;
   joined to the life he has known by the merest tube in which he may
   only crawl and which any accident or evil design might block the
   whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the
   pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity for
   me this opportunity came much earlier than i expected

   that evening the members of our party feeling some what tired after
   the strenuous program of the day i went alone with abdul reis for a
   walk through the picturesque arab quarter though i had seen it by day
   i wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk when rich shadows
   and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic
   illusion the native crowds were thinning but were still very noisy
   and numerous when we came upon a knot of reveling bedouins in the
   sukennahhasin or bazaar of the coppersmiths their apparent leader
   an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush took
   some notice of us and evidently recognized with no great friendliness
   my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide

   perhaps i thought he resented that odd reproduction of the sphinxs
   halfsmile which i had often remarked with amused irritation; or
   perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of abduls
   voice at any rate the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language
   became very brisk; and before long ali ziz as i heard the stranger
   called when called by no worse name began to pull violently at abduls
   robe an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle
   in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and
   would have reached an even direr condition had i not intervened and
   separated them by main force

   my interference at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides succeeded
   at last in effecting a truce sullenly each belligerent composed his
   wrath and his attire and with an assumption of dignity as profound as
   it was sudden the two formed a curious pact of honor which i soon
   learned is a custom of great antiquity in cairoa pact for the
   settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop
   the great pyramid long after the departure of the last moonlight
   sightseer each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds and the
   affair was to begin at midnight proceeding by rounds in the most
   civilized possible fashion

   in all this planning there was much which excited my interest the
   fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular while the thought
   of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of
   gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every
   fiber of imagination in me a request found abdul exceedingly willing
   to admit me to his party of seconds; so that all the rest of the early
   evening i accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions
   of the townmostly northeast of the ezbekiyehwhere he gathered one
   by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his
   pugilistic background

   shortly after nine our party mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or
   touristreminiscent names as rameses mark twain j p morgan
   and minnehaha edged through street labyrinths both oriental and
   occidental crossed the muddy and mastforested nile by the bridge of
   the bronze lions and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on
   the road to gizeh slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip
   toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists
   saluted the last inbound trolleycar and were alone with the night and
   the past and the spectral moon

   then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue ghoulish with a
   dim atavistical menace which i had not seemed to notice in the daytime
   even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly for was it not in
   this that they had buried queen nitocris alive in the sixth dynasty;
   subtle queen nitocris who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a
   temple below the nile and drowned them by opening the watergates? i
   recalled that the arabs whisper things about nitocris and shun the
   third pyramid at certain phases of the moon it must have been over her
   that thomas moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by
   memphian boatmen: the subterranean nymph that dwells mid sunless gems
   and glories hid the lady of the pyramid!

   early as we were ali ziz and his party were ahead of us; for we saw
   their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at kafrelharam;
   toward which squalid arab settlement close to the sphinx we had
   diverged instead of following the regular road to the mena house where
   some of the sleepy inefficient police might have observed and halted
   us here where filthy bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock
   tombs of khephrens courtiers we were led up the rocks and over the
   sand to the great pyramid up whose timeworn sides the arabs swarmed
   eagerly abdul reis offering me the assistance i did not need

   as most travelers know the actual apex of this structure has long been
   worn away leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square on
   this eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed and in a few moments
   the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which but for the
   quality of the ringside cries might well have occurred at some minor
   athletic club in america as i watched it i felt that some of our
   lessdesirable institutions were not lacking; for every blow feint
   and defense bespoke stalling to my not inexperienced eye it was
   quickly over and despite my misgivings as to methods i felt a sort of
   proprietary pride when abdul reis was adjudged the winner

   reconciliation was phenomenally rapid and amidst the singing
   fraternizing and drinking that followed i found it difficult to
   realize that a quarrel had ever occurred oddly enough i myself seemed
   to be more a center of notice than the antagonists; and from my
   smattering of arabic i judged that they were discussing my professional
   performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement in
   a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me but a
   distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape it
   gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of egypt did not depart
   without leaving traces and that fragments of a strange secret lore and
   priestly cultpractices have survived surreptitiously amongst the
   fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or
   magician is resented and disputed i thought of how much my
   hollowvoiced guide abdul reis looked like an old egyptian priest or
   pharaoh or smiling sphinxand wondered

   suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of
   my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby i had accepted
   this nights events as other than the empty and malicious frameup
   they now showed themselves to be without warning and doubtless in
   answer to some subtle sign from abdul the entire band of bedouins
   precipitated itself upon me; and having produced heavy ropes soon had
   me bound as securely as i was ever bound in the course of my life
   either on the stage or off

   i struggled at first but soon saw that one man could make no headway
   against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians my hands were tied
   behind my back my knees bent to their fullest extent and my wrists
   and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords a stifling
   gag was forced into my mouth and a blindfold fastened tightly over my
   eyes then as arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a
   jouncing descent of the pyramid i heard the taunts of my late guide
   abdul who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice and
   assured me that i was soon to have my magicpowers put to a supreme
   testwhich would quickly remove any egotism i might have gained
   through triumphing over all the tests offered by america and europe
   egypt he reminded me is very old and full of inner mysteries and
   antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today whose
   devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me

   how far or in what direction i was carried i cannot tell; for the
   circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment
   i know however that it could not have been a great distance; since my
   bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk yet kept me aloft a
   surprisingly short time it is this perplexing brevity which makes me
   feel almost like shuddering whenever i think of gizeh and its
   plateaufor one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday
   tourist routes of what existed then and must exist still

   the evil abnormality i speak of did not become manifest at first
   setting me down on a surface which i recognized as sand rather than
   rock my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few
   feet to a ragged opening in the ground into which they presently
   lowered me with much rough handling for apparent eons i bumped against
   the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which i took to be one
   of the numerous burialshafts of the plateau until the prodigious
   almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture

   the horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second that
   any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without
   reaching the core of the planet itself or that any rope made by man
   could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly
   fathomless profundities of nether earth were beliefs of such
   grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to
   accept them even now i am uncertain for i know how deceitful the
   sense of time becomes when one is removed or distorted but i am quite
   sure that i preserved a logical consciousness that far; that at least i
   did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous
   enough in its reality and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion
   vastly short of actual hallucination

   all this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting the shocking
   ordeal was cumulative and the beginning of the later terrors was a
   very perceptible increase in my rate of descent they were paying out
   that infinitely long rope very swiftly now and i scraped cruelly
   against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as i shot madly
   downward my clothing was in tatters and i felt the trickle of blood
   all over even above the mounting and excruciating pain my nostrils
   too were assailed by a scarcely definable menace: a creeping odor of
   damp and staleness curiously unlike anything i had ever smelled before
   and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of
   mockery

   then the mental cataclysm came it was horriblehideous beyond all
   articulate description because it was all of the soul with nothing of
   detail to describe it was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation
   of the fiendish the suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniacone
   moment i was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of
   milliontoothed torture yet the next moment i was soaring on batwings
   in the gulfs of hell; swinging free and swooping through illimitable
   miles of boundless musty space; rising dizzily to measureless
   pinnacles of chilling ether then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of
   ravenous nauseous lower vacuathank god for the mercy that shut out
   in oblivion those clawing furies of consciousness which half unhinged
   my faculties and tore harpylike at my spirit! that one respite short
   as it was gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still
   greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the
   road ahead

                                     ii

   it was very gradually that i regained my senses after that eldritch
   flight through stygian space the process was infinitely painful and
   colored by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition
   found singular embodiment the precise nature of these dreams was very
   clear while i was experiencing them but became blurred in my
   recollection almost immediately afterward and was soon reduced to the
   merest outline by the terrible eventsreal or imaginarywhich
   followed i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible
   paw; a yellow hairy fiveclawed paw which had reached out of the
   earth to crush and engulf me and when i stopped to reflect what the
   paw was it seemed to me that it was egypt in the dream i looked back
   at the events of the preceding weeks and saw myself lured and enmeshed
   little by little subtly and insidiously by some hellish ghoulspirit
   of the elder nile sorcery; some spirit that was in egypt before ever
   man was and that will be when man is no more

   i saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of egypt and the grisly
   alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead i
   saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls falcons
   cats and ibises; phantom processions marching interminably through
   subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which
   a man is as a fly and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable
   gods stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of
   grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant
   rivers of pitch and behind it all i saw the ineffable malignity of
   primordial necromancy black and amorphous and fumbling greedily after
   me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by
   emulation

   in my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred
   and pursuit and i saw the black soul of egypt singling me out and
   calling me in inaudible whispers; calling and luring me leading me on
   with the glitter and glamor of a saracenic surface but ever pulling me
   down to the agemad catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal
   pharaonic heart

   then the dream faces took on human resemblances and i saw my guide
   abdul reis in the robes of a king with the sneer of the sphinx on his
   features and i knew that those features were the features of khephren
   the great who raised the second pyramid carved over the sphinxs face
   in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose
   myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the
   cryptical sand and the uninformative rock and i looked at the long
   lean rigid hand of khephren; the long lean rigid hand as i had seen
   it on the diorite statue in the cairo museumthe statue they had found
   in the terrible gateway templeand wondered that i had not shrieked
   when i saw it on abdul reis that hand! it was hideously cold and it
   was crushing me; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagusthe
   chill and constriction of unrememberable egypt it was nighted
   necropolitan egypt itselfthat yellow pawand they whisper such
   things of khephren

   but at this juncture i began to wakeor at least to assume a
   condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding i
   recalled the fight atop the pyramid the treacherous bedouins and their
   attack my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths and
   my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic
   putrescence i perceived that i now lay on a damp rock floor and that
   my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force it was very
   cold and i seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping
   across me the cuts and bruises i had received from the jagged sides of
   the rock shaft were paining me woefully their soreness enhanced to a
   stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint
   draft and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole
   frame throbbing with untold agony

   as i turned i felt a tug from above and concluded that the rope
   whereby i was lowered still reached to the surface whether or not the
   arabs still held it i had no idea; nor had i any idea how far within
   the earth i was i knew that the darkness around me was wholly or
   nearly total since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold; but i
   did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth
   the sensation of vast duration which had characterized my descent

   knowing at least that i was in a space of considerable extent reached
   from the above surface directly by an opening in the rock i doubtfully
   conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old
   khephrenthe temple of the sphinxperhaps some inner corridors which
   the guides had not shown me during my morning visit and from which i
   might easily escape if i could find my way to the barred entrance it
   would be a labyrinthine wandering but no worse than others out of
   which i had in the past found my way

   the first step was to get free of my bonds gag and blindfold; and
   this i knew would be no great task since subtler experts than these
   arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long
   and varied career as an exponent of escape yet had never succeeded in
   defeating my methods

   then it occurred to me that the arabs might be ready to meet and attack
   me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the
   binding cords as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the
   rope which they probably held this of course was taking for granted
   that my place of confinement was indeed khephrens temple of the
   sphinx the direct opening in the roof wherever it might lurk could
   not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the
   sphinx; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface
   since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous i had
   not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage but knew
   that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands

   thinking these matters over as i lay bent and bound on the rock floor
   i nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging
   which had so lately reduced me to a coma my present thought was only
   to outwit the arabs and i accordingly determined to work myself free
   as quickly as possible avoiding any tug on the descending line which
   might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedom

   this however was more easily determined than effected a few
   preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished
   without considerable motion; and it did not surprise me when after one
   especially energetic struggle i began to feel the coils of falling
   rope as they piled up about me and upon me obviously i thought the
   bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope;
   hastening no doubt to the temples true entrance to lie murderously in
   wait for me

   the prospect was not pleasingbut i had faced worse in my time without
   flinching and would not flinch now at present i must first of all
   free myself of bonds then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple
   unharmed it is curious how implicitly i had come to believe myself in
   the old temple of khephren beside the sphinx only a short distance
   below the ground

   that belief was shattered and every pristine apprehension of
   preternatural depth and demoniac mystery revived by a circumstance
   which grew in horror and significance even as i formulated my
   philosophical plan i have said that the falling rope was piling up
   about and upon me now i saw that it was continuing to pile as no rope
   of normal length could possibly do it gained in momentum and became an
   avalanche of hemp accumulating mountainously on the floor and half
   burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils soon i was completely
   engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions
   submerged and stifled me

   my senses tottered again and i vaguely tried to fight off a menace
   desperate and ineluctable it was not merely that i was tortured beyond
   human endurancenot merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed
   slowly out of meit was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths
   of rope implied and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable
   gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me my endless
   descent and swinging flight through goblin space then must have been
   real and even now i must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern
   world toward the core of the planet such a sudden confirmation of
   ultimate horror was insupportable and a second time i lapsed into
   merciful oblivion

   when i say oblivion i do not imply that i was free from dreams on the
   contrary my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of
   the most unutterable hideousness god!if only i had not read so much
   egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all
   darkness and terror! this second spell of fainting filled my sleeping
   mind anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic
   secrets and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the
   ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body
   beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves i
   recalled in dreamshapes which it is well that i do not remember the
   peculiar and elaborate construction of egyptian sepulchers; and the
   exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this
   construction

   all these people thought of was death and the dead they conceived of a
   literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with
   desperate care and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near
   the corpse; whilst besides the body they believed in two other
   elements the soul which after its weighing and approval by osiris
   dwelt in the land of the blest and the obscure and portentous ka or
   lifeprinciple which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a
   horrible way demanding occasional access to the preserved body
   consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to
   the mortuary chapel and sometimesas men whisperedtaking its body
   or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously
   abroad on errands peculiarly repellent

   for thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and
   staring glassily upward when not visited by the ka awaiting the day
   when osiris should restore both ka and soul and lead forth the stiff
   legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep it was to have
   been a glorious rebirthbut not all souls were approved nor were all
   tombs inviolate so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish
   abnormalities were to be looked for even today the arabs murmur of
   unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether
   abysses which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit
   and return unscathed

   perhaps the most leeringly bloodcongealing legends are those which
   relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraftcomposite
   mummies made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the
   heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods at all stages of
   history the sacred animals were mummified so that consecrated bulls
   cats ibises crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater
   glory but only in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal
   in the same mummyonly in the decadence when they did not understand
   the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul

   what happened to those composite mummies is not told ofat least
   publiclyand it is certain that no egyptologist ever found one the
   whispers of arabs are very wild and cannot be relied upon they even
   hint that old khephrenhe of the sphinx the second pyramid and the
   yawning gateway templelives far underground wedded to the ghoulqueen
   nitocris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of
   beast

   it was of theseof khephren and his consort and his strange armies of
   the hybrid deadthat i dreamed and that is why i am glad the exact
   dreamshapes have faded from my memory my most horrible vision was
   connected with an idle question i had asked myself the day before when
   looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with
   what unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected
   that question so innocent and whimsical then assumed in my dream a
   meaning of frenetic and hysterical madnesswhat huge and loathsome
   abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent?

   my second awakeningif awakening it wasis a memory of stark
   hideousness which nothing else in my lifesave one thing which came
   aftercan parallel; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond
   most mens remember that i had lost consciousness whilst buried
   beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the
   cataclysmic depth of my present position now as perception returned
   i felt the entire weight gone; and realized upon rolling over that
   although i was still tied gagged and blindfolded some agency had
   removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had
   overwhelmed me the significance of this condition of course came to
   me only gradually; but even so i think it would have brought
   unconsciousness again had i not by this time reached such a state of
   emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference i
   was alone with what?

   before i could torture myself with any new reflection or make any
   fresh effort to escape from my bonds an additional circumstance became
   manifest pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs and i
   seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former
   cuts and abrasions could furnish my chest too seemed pierced by a
   hundred wounds as though some malign titanic ibis had been pecking at
   it assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one
   and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled
   to desist yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the
   reverse of what one might expect instead of sinking into a bottomless
   pit of despair i was stirred to a new courage and action; for now i
   felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man
   might encounter on an even basis

   on the strength of this thought i tugged again at my bonds and used
   all the art of a lifetime to free myself as i had so often done amidst
   the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds the familiar
   details of my escaping process commenced to engross me and now that
   the long rope was gone i half regained my belief that the supreme
   horrors were hallucinations after all and that there had never been
   any terrible shaft measureless abyss or interminable rope was i after
   all in the gateway temple of khephren beside the sphinx and had the
   sneaking arabs stolen in to torture me as i lay helpless there? at any
   rate i must be free let me stand up unbound ungagged and with eyes
   open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any
   source and i could actually delight in the combat against evil and
   treacherous foes!

   how long i took in shaking off my encumbrances i cannot tell it must
   have been longer than in my exhibition performances because i was
   wounded exhausted and enervated by the experiences i had passed
   through when i was finally free and taking deep breaths of a chill
   damp evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without
   the screen of gag and blindfold edges i found that i was too cramped
   and fatigued to move at once there i lay trying to stretch a frame
   bent and mangled for an indefinite period and straining my eyes to
   catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my
   position

   by degrees my strength and flexibility returned but my eyes beheld
   nothing as i staggered to my feet i peered diligently in every
   direction yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that i had known
   when blindfolded i tried my legs bloodencrusted beneath my shredded
   trousers and found that i could walk; yet could not decide in what
   direction to go obviously i ought not to walk at random and perhaps
   retreat directly from the entrance i sought; so i paused to note the
   difference of the cold fetid natronscented aircurrent which i had
   never ceased to feel accepting the point of its source as the possible
   entrance to the abyss i strove to keep track of this landmark and to
   walk consistently toward it

   i had a matchbox with me and even a small electric flashlight; but of
   course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since
   emptied of all heavy articles as i walked cautiously in the blackness
   the draft grew stronger and more offensive till at length i could
   regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor
   pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the
   fishermans jar in the eastern tale the eastegypttruly this
   dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and
   marvels unspeakable!

   the more i reflected on the nature of this cavern wind the greater my
   sense of disquiet became; for although despite its odor i had sought
   its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world i now saw
   plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection
   whatsoever with the clean air of the libyan desert but must be
   essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down i
   had then been walking in the wrong direction!

   after a moments reflection i decided not to retrace my steps away
   from the draft i would have no landmarks for the roughly level rock
   floor was devoid of distinctive configurations if however i followed
   up the strange current i would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of
   some sort from whose gate i could perhaps work round the walls to the
   opposite side of this cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall that i
   might fail i well realized i saw that this was no part of khephrens
   gateway temple which tourists know and it struck me that this
   particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists and merely
   stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant arabs who had imprisoned
   me if so was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or
   to the outer air?

   what evidence indeed did i now possess that this was the gateway
   temple at all? for a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back
   upon me and i thought of that vivid melange of impressionsdescent
   suspension in space the rope my wounds and the dreams that were
   frankly dreams was this the end of life for me? or indeed would it be
   merciful if this moment were the end? i could answer none of my own
   questions but merely kept on till fate for a third time reduced me to
   oblivion

   this time there were no dreams for the suddenness of the incident
   shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious
   tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the
   offensive draft became strong enough to offer an actual physical
   resistance i was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge
   stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved

   that i ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the
   healthy human organism often i look back to that night and feel a
   touch of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness; lapses
   whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude
   cinema melodramas of that period of course it is possible that the
   repeated lapses never occurred; and that all the features of that
   underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which
   began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the
   healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me
   stretched on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic and dawnflushed
   face of the great sphinx

   i prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as i can hence was
   glad when the police told me that the barrier to krephrens gateway
   temple had been found unfastened and that a sizeable rift to the
   surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part i
   was glad too when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be
   expected from my seizure blindfolding lowering struggling with
   bonds falling some distanceperhaps into a depression in the temples
   inner gallerydragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from
   it and experiences like thata very soothing diagnosis and yet i
   know that there must be more than appears on the surface that extreme
   descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissedand it is odd that no
   one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my
   guide abdul reis el drogman the tombthroated guide who looked and
   smiled like king khephren

   i have digressed from my connected narrativeperhaps in the vain hope
   of evading the telling of that final incident; that incident which of
   all is most certainly an hallucination but i promised to relate it
   and i do not break promises when i recoveredor seemed to recovermy
   senses after that fall down the black stone stairs i was quite as
   alone and in darkness as before the windy stench bad enough before
   was now fiendish; yet i had acquired enough familiarity by this time to
   bear it stoically dazedly i began to crawl away from the place whence
   the putrid wind came and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal
   blocks of a mighty pavement once my head struck against a hard object
   and when i felt of it i learned that it was the base of a columna
   column of unbelievable immensitywhose surface was covered with
   gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch

   crawling on i encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible
   distances apart; when suddenly my attention was captured by the
   realization of something which must have been impinging on my
   subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it

   from some still lower chasm in earths bowels were proceeding certain
   sounds measured and definite and like nothing i had ever heard
   before that they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial i felt
   almost intuitively; and much reading in egyptology led me to associate
   them with the flute the sambuke the sistrum and the tympanum in
   their rhythmic piping droning rattling and beating i felt an element
   of terror beyond all the known terrors of eartha terror peculiarly
   dissociated from personal fear and taking the form of a sort of
   objective pity for our planet that it should hold within its depths
   such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies the sounds
   increased in volume and i felt that they were approaching thenand
   may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears
   againi began to hear faintly and afar off the morbid and millennial
   tramping of the marching things

   it was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect
   rhythm the training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind
   that march of earths inmost monstrositiespadding clicking
   walking stalking rumbling lumbering crawlingand all to the
   abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments and thengod keep the
   memory of those arab legends out of my head!the mummies without
   soulsthe meetingplace of the wandering kas the hordes of the
   devilcursed pharaonic dead of forty centuriesthe composite mummies
   led through the uttermost onyx voids by king khephren and his
   ghoulqueen nitocris

   the tramping drew nearerheaven save me from the sound of those feet
   and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire
   detail! down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light
   flickered in the malodorous wind and i drew behind the enormous
   circumference of a cyclopic column that i might escape for a while the
   horror that was stalking millionfooted toward me through gigantic
   hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity the flickers
   increased and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud
   in the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such
   stony awe that i gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and
   repulsion bases of columns whose middles were higher than human
   sight mere bases of things that must each dwarf the eiffel tower to
   insignificancehieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns
   where daylight can be only a remote legend

   i would not look at the marching things that i desperately resolved as
   i heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music
   and the dead tramping it was merciful that they did not speak but
   god! their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those
   stupendous columns hippopotami should not have human hands and carry
   torches men should not have the heads of crocodiles

   i tried to turn away but the shadows and the sounds and the stench
   were everywhere then i remembered something i used to do in
   halfconscious nightmares as a boy and began to repeat to myself
   this is a dream! this is a dream! but it was of no use and i could
   only shut my eyes and prayat least that is what i think i did for
   one is never sure in visionsand i know this can have been nothing
   more i wondered whether i should ever reach the world again and at
   times would furtively open my eyes to see if i could discern any
   feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction the
   topless columns and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal
   horror the sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone and
   unless this hellish place were wholly without walls i could not fail
   to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon but i had to shut my eyes
   again when i realized how many of the things were assemblingand when
   i glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadily without any
   body above the waist

   a fiendish and ululant corpsegurgle or deathrattle now split the very
   atmospherethe charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen
   blastsin one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid
   blasphemies my eyes perversely shaken open gazed for an instant upon
   a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic fear
   and physical exhaustion the things had filed ceremonially in one
   direction the direction of the noisome wind where the light of their
   torches showed their bended headsor the bended heads of such as had
   heads they were worshipping before a great black fetorbelching
   aperture which reached up almost out of sight and which i could see
   was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far
   away in shadow one of these was indubitably the staircase i had fallen
   down

   the dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the
   columnsan ordinary house would have been lost in it and any average
   public building could easily have been moved in and out it was so vast
   a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its
   boundariesso vast so hideously black and so aromatically
   stinking directly in front of this yawning polyphemusdoor the
   things were throwing objectsevidently sacrifices or religious
   offerings to judge by their gestures khephren was their leader;
   sneering king khephren or the guide abdul reis crowned with a golden
   pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead
   by his side knelt beautiful queen nitocris whom i saw in profile for a
   moment noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats
   or other ghouls and i shut my eyes again when i saw what objects were
   being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its possible local
   deity

   it occurred to me that judging from the elaborateness of this worship
   the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance was it
   osiris or isis horus or anubis or some vast unknown god of the dead
   still more central and supreme? there is a legend that terrible altars
   and colossi were reared to an unknown one before ever the known gods
   were worshipped

   and now as i steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral
   adorations of those nameless things a thought of escape flashed upon
   me the hall was dim and the columns heavy with shadow with every
   creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures it
   might be barely possible for me to creep past to the faraway end of
   one of the staircases and ascend unseen; trusting to fate and skill to
   deliver me from the upper reaches where i was i neither knew nor
   seriously reflected uponand for a moment it struck me as amusing to
   plan a serious escape from that which i knew to be a dream was i in
   some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of khephrens gateway
   templethat temple which generations have persistently called the
   temple of the sphinx? i could not conjecture but i resolved to ascend
   to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me

   wriggling flat on my stomach i began the anxious journey toward the
   foot of the lefthand staircase which seemed the more accessible of
   the two i cannot describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl
   but they may be guessed when one reflects on what i had to watch
   steadily in that malign windblown torchlight in order to avoid
   detection the bottom of the staircase was as i have said far away in
   shadow as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted
   landing above the titanic aperture this placed the last stages of my
   crawl at some distance from the noisome herd though the spectacle
   chilled me even when quite remote at my right

   at length i succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb; keeping
   close to the wall on which i observed decorations of the most hideous
   sort and relying for safety on the absorbed ecstatic interest with
   which the monstrosities watched the foulbreezed aperture and the
   impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before
   it though the staircase was huge and steep fashioned of vast porphyry
   blocks as if for the feet of a giant the ascent seemed virtually
   interminable dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise
   had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of
   agonizing memory i had intended on reaching the landing to climb
   immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from
   there; stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed
   and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet belowyet a sudden
   repetition of that thunderous corpsegurgle and deathrattle chorus
   coming as i had nearly gained the top of the flight and showing by its
   ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery caused me
   to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet

   the monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of
   the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it it was
   something quite ponderous even as seen from my height; something
   yellowish and hairy and endowed with a sort of nervous motion it was
   as large perhaps as a goodsized hippopotamus but very curiously
   shaped it seemed to have no neck but five separate shaggy heads
   springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk; the first very
   small the second goodsized the third and fourth equal and largest of
   all and the fifth rather small though not so small as the first

   out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized
   ravenously on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food
   placed before the aperture once in a while the thing would leap up
   and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner
   its locomotion was so inexplicable that i stared in fascination
   wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me

   then it did emergeit did emerge and at the sight i turned and fled
   into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me; fled
   unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to
   which no human sight or logic guided me and which i must ever relegate
   to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation it must have been
   a dream or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands
   of gizeh before the sardonic dawnflushed face of the great sphinx

   the great sphinx! god!that idle question i asked myself on that
   sunblest morning beforewhat huge and loathsome abnormality was the
   sphinx originally carven to represent?

   accursed is the sight be it in dream or not that revealed to me the
   supreme horrorthe unknown god of the dead which licks its colossal
   chops in the unsuspected abyss fed hideous morsels by soulless
   absurdities that should not exist the fiveheaded monster that
   emergedthat fiveheaded monster as large as a hippopotamusthe
   five headed monsterand that of which it is the merest forepaw

   but i survived and i know it was only a dream

i[edit]

   out of the reaches of illimitable night
   the blazing planet grew and forcd to life
   unending cycles of progressive strife
   and strange mutations of undying light
   and boresome books than hells own self more trite
   and thoughts repeated and become a blight
   and cheap rumhounds with moonshine hootch made tight
   and quite contrite to see the flight of fright so bright
   i used to ride my bicycle in the night
   with a dandy acetylene lantern that cost $300
   in the evening by the moonlight you can hear those darkies singing
   meet me tonight  in dreamland bah!
   i used to sit on the stairs of the house where i was born
   after we left it but before it was sold
   and play on a zobo with two other boys
   we called ourselves the blackstone military band
   wont you come home bill bailey wont you come home?
   in the spring of the year in the silver rain
   when petal by petal the blossoms fall
   and the mocking birds call
   and the whippoorwill sings marguerite
   the first cinema show in our town opened in 1906
   at the old olympic which was then calld park
   and moving beams shot weirdly thro the dark
   and spit tobacco seldom hit the mark
   have you read dickens american notes?
   my greatgreatgrandfather was born in a white house
   under green trees in the country
   and he used to believe in religion and the weather

ii[edit]

   shantih shantih shantihshanty house
   was the name of a novel by i forget whom
   published serially in the allstory weekly
   before it was a weekly advt
   disillusion is wonderful ive been told
   and i take quinine to stop a cold
   but it makes my ears always
   always ringing in my ears
   it is the ghost of the jew i murdered that christmas day
   because he played three oclock in the morning in the flat above
   me
   three oclock in the morning ive dancd the whole night through
   dancing on the graves in the graveyard
   where life is buried; life and beauty
   life and art and love and duty
   ah there sweet cutie
   stung!
   out of the night that covers me
   black as the pit from pole to pole
   i never quote things straight except by accident
   sophistication! sophistication!
   you are the idol of our nation
   each fellow has
   fallen for jazz
   and well give the past a merry razz
   thro the ghoulguarded gateways of slumber
   and fellowguestship with the glutless worm
   next stop is 57th st  57th st the next stop
   achilles wrath to greece the direful spring
   and the governorgeneral of canada is lord byng
   whose ancestor was shot or hung
   i forget which the good die young
   heres to your ripe old age
   copyright 1847 by joseph miner
   entered according to act of congress

iii[edit]

   in the office of the librarian of congress
   america was discovered in 1492
   this way out
   no lady you gotta change at washington st to the everett train
   out in the rain on the elevated
   crated sated all mismated
   twelve seats on this bench
   how quaint
   in a shady nook beside a brook two lovers stroll along
   express to park ave car following
   no we had it cleaned with the sand blast
   i know it ought to be torn down
   before the bar of a saloon there stood a reckless crew
   when one said to another jack this message came for you
   it may be from a sweetheart boys said someone in the crowd
   and here the words are missing but jack cried out aloud:
   its only a message from home sweet home
   from loved ones down on the farm
   fond wife and mother sister and brother
   bootleggers all and youre another
   in the shade of the old apple tree
   neath the old cherry tree sweet marie
   the conchologists first book
   by edgar allan poe
   stubbed his toe
   on a broken brick that didnt show
   or a banana peel
   in the fifth reel
   by george creel
   it is to laugh
   and quaff
   it makes you stout and hale
   and all my days ill sing the praise
   of ivory soap
   have you a little t s eliot in your house?

iv[edit]

   the stag at eve had drunk his fill
   the thirsty hart lookd up the hill
   and craned his neck just as a feeler
   to advertise the doubledealer
   william congreve was a gentleman
   o art what sins are committed in thy name
   for tawdry fame and fleeting flame
   and everything aint dat a shame?
   mah creole belle ah lubs yo well;
   aroun mah heart you hab cast a spell
   but i cant learn to spell pseudocracy
   because there aint no such word
   and i says to lizzie if joe was my feller
   id teach him to go to dances with that
   rat bat cat hat flat plat fat
   fry the fat fat the fry
   youll be a drugstore by and by
   get the hook!
   above the lines of brooding hills
   rose spires that reeked of nameless ills
   and ghastly shone upon the sight
   in evry flash of lurid light
   to be continued
   no smoking
   smoking on four rear seats
   fare win return to 5 cents after august 1st
   except outside the cleveland city limits
   in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir
   strangers pause to shed a tear;
   henry fielding wrote tom jones
   and cursed be he that moves my bones
   i saw the leonardtendler fight
   farewell farewell o go to hell
   nobody home
   in the shantih

what the moon brings

   what the moon brings
   by h p lovecraft
   8530what the moon bringsh p lovecraft

   i hate the moon  i am afraid of it  for when it shines on certain
   scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and
   hideous

   it was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old
   garden where i wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and
   humid seas of foliage that bring wild and manycoloured dreams and as
   i walked by the shallow crystal stream i saw unwonted ripples tipped
   with yellow light as if those placid waters were drawn on in
   resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world silent
   and sparkling bright and baleful those mooncursed waters hurried i
   knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotosblossoms
   fluttered one by one in the opiate nightwind and dropped despairingly
   into the stream swirling away horribly under the arched carven
   bridge and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm dead
   faces

   and as i ran along the shore crushing sleeping flowers with heedless
   feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of
   the dead faces i saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for
   where by day the walls were there stretched now only new vistas of
   trees and paths flowers and shrubs stone idols and pagodas and
   bendings of the yellowlitten stream past grassy banks and under
   grotesque bridges of marble and the lips of the dead lotosfaces
   whispered sadly and bade me follow nor did i cease my steps till the
   stream became a river and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and
   beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea

   upon that sea the hateful moon shone and over its unvocal waves weird
   perfumes breeded and as i saw therein the lotosfaces vanish i longed
   for nets that i might capture them and learn from them the secrets
   which the moon had brought upon the night but when that moon went over
   to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore i saw in
   that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered and white
   columns gay with festoons of green seaweed and knowing that to this
   sunken place all the dead had come i trembled and did not wish again
   to speak with the lotosfaces

   yet when i saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky
   to seek rest on a vast reef i would fain have questioned him and
   asked him of those whom i had known when they were alive this i would
   have asked him had he not been so far away but he was very far and
   could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef

   so i watched the tide go out under that sinking moon and saw gleaming
   the spires the towers and the roofs of that dead dripping city and
   as i watched my nostrils tried to close against the perfumeconquering
   stench of the worlds dead; for truly in this unplaced and forgotten
   spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy seaworms
   to gnaw and glut upon

   over these horrors the evil moon now hung very low but the puffy worms
   of the sea need no moon to feed by and as i watched the ripples that
   told of the writhing of worms beneath i felt a new chill from afar out
   whither the condor had flown as if my flesh had caught a horror before
   my eyes had seen it

   nor had my flesh trembled without cause for when i raised my eyes i
   saw that the waters had ebbed very low shewing much of the vast reef
   whose rim i had seen before and when i saw that the reef was but the
   black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now
   shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish
   ooze miles below i shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise
   above the waters and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the
   slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon

   and to escape this relentless thing i plunged gladly and unhesitantly
   into the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets
   fat seaworms feast upon the worlds dead

   where once poe walked

   eternal brood the shadows on this ground
   dreaming of centuries that have gone before;
   great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound
   arched high above a hidden world of yore
   round all the scene a light of memory plays
   and dead leaves whisper of departed days
   longing for sights and sounds that are no more

   lonely and sad a specter glides along
   aisles where of old his living footsteps fell;
   no common glance discerns him though his song
   peals down through time with a mysterious spell
   only the few who sorcerys secret know
   espy amidst these tombs the shade of poe

   1364035winged deathhp lovecraft and hazel heald1932

   the orange hotel stands in high street near the railway station in
   bloemfontein south africa on sunday january 24 1932 four men sat
   shivering from terror in a room on its third floor one was george c
   titteridge proprietor of the hotel; another was police constable ian
   de witt of the central station; a third was johannes bogaert the local
   coroner; the fourth and apparently the least disorganised of the
   group was dr cornelius van keulen the coroners physician on the
   floor uncomfortably evident amidst the stifling summer heat was the
   body of a dead manbut this was not what the four were afraid of
   their glances wandered from the table on which lay a curious
   assortment of things to the ceiling overhead across whose smooth
   whiteness a series of huge faltering alphabetical characters had
   somehow been scrawled in ink; and every now and then dr van keulen
   would glance halffurtively at a worn leather blankbook which he held
   in his left hand the horror of the four seemed about equally divided
   among the blankbook the scrawled words on the ceiling and a dead fly
   of peculiar aspect which floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table
   also on the table were an open inkwell a pen and writingpad a
   physicians medical case a bottle of hydrochloric acid and a tumbler
   about a quarter full of black oxide of manganese the worn leather book
   was the journal of the dead man on the floor and had at once made it
   clear that the name frederick n mason mining properties toronto
   canada signed in the hotel register was a false one there were
   other thingsterrible thingswhich it likewise made clear; and still
   other things of far greater terror at which it hinted hideously without
   making them clear or even fully believable it was the halfbelief of
   the four men fostered by lives spent close to the black settled
   secrets of brooding africa which made them shiver so violently in
   spite of the searing january heat the blankbook was not a large one
   and the entries were in a fine handwriting which however grew
   careless and nervouslooking toward the last it consisted of a series
   of jottings at first rather irregularly spaced but finally becoming
   daily to call it a diary would not be quite correct for it chronicled
   only one set of its writers activities dr van keulen recognised the
   name of the dead man the moment he opened the cover for it was that of
   an eminent member of his own profession who had been largely connected
   with african matters in another moment he was horrified to find this
   name linked with a dastardly crime officially unsolved which had
   filled the newspapers some four months before and the farther he read
   the deeper grew his horror awe and sense of loathing and panic here
   in essence is the text which the doctor read aloud in that sinister
   and increasingly noisome room while the three men around him breathed
   hard fidgeted in their chairs and darted frightened glances at the
   ceiling the table the thing on the floor and one another:

   journal of thomas slauenwite md

   touching punishment of henry sargent moore phd of brooklyn new
   york professor of invertebrate biology in columbia university new
   york ny prepared to be read after my death for the satisfaction of
   making public the accomplishment of my revenge which may otherwise
   never be imputed to me even if it succeeds january 5 1929i have now
   fully resolved to kill dr henry moore and a recent incident has shewn
   me how i shall do it from now on i shall follow a consistent line of
   action; hence the beginning of this journal it is hardly necessary to
   repeat the circumstances which have driven me to this course for the
   informed part of the public is familiar with all the salient facts i
   was born in trenton new jersey on april 12 1885 the son of dr paul
   slauenwite formerly of pretoria transvaal south africa studying
   medicine as part of my family tradition i was led by my father (who
   died in 1916 while i was serving in france in a south african
   regiment) to specialise in african fevers; and after my graduation from
   columbia spent much time in researches which took me from durban in
   natal up to the equator itself in mombasa i worked out my new theory
   of the transmission and development of remittent fever aided only
   slightly by the papers of the late government physician sir norman
   sloane which i found in the house i occupied when i published my
   results i became at a single stroke a famous authority i was told of
   the probability of an almost supreme position in the south african
   health service and even a probable knighthood in the event of my
   becoming a naturalised citizen and accordingly i took the necessary
   steps then occurred the incident for which i am about to kill henry
   moore this man my classmate and friend of years in america and
   africa chose deliberately to undermine my claim to my own theory;
   alleging that sir norman sloane had anticipated me in every essential
   detail and implying that i had probably found more of his papers than
   i had stated in my account of the matter to buttress this absurd
   accusation he produced certain personal letters from sir norman which
   indeed shewed that the older man had been over my ground and that he
   would have published his results very soon but for his sudden death
   this much i could only admit with regret what i could not excuse was
   the jealous suspicion that i had stolen the theory from sir normans
   papers the british government sensibly enough ignored these
   aspersions but withheld the halfpromised appointment and knighthood
   on the ground that my theory while original with me was not in fact
   new i could soon see that my career in africa was perceptibly checked;
   though i had placed all my hopes on such a career even to the point of
   resigning american citizenship a distinct coolness toward me had
   arisen among the government set in mombasa especially among those who
   had known sir norman it was then that i resolved to be even with moore
   sooner or later though i did not know how he had been jealous of my
   early celebrity and had taken advantage of his old correspondence with
   sir norman to ruin me this from the friend whom i had myself led to
   take an interest in africawhom i had coached and inspired till he
   achieved his present moderate fame as an authority on african
   entomology even now though i will not deny that his attainments are
   profound i made him and in return he has ruined me nowsome dayi
   shall destroy him when i saw myself losing ground in mombasa i
   applied for my present situation in the interiorat mgonga only
   fifty miles from the uganda line it is a cotton and ivory
   tradingpost with only eight white men besides myself a beastly hole
   almost on the equator and full of every sort of fever known to
   mankind poisonous snakes and insects everywhere and niggers with
   diseases nobody ever heard of outside medical college but my work is
   not hard and i have always had plenty of time to plan things to do to
   henry moore it amuses me to give his diptera of central and southern
   africa a prominent place on my shelf i suppose it actually is a
   standard manualthey use it at columbia harvard and the u of
   wisbut my own suggestions are really responsible for half its strong
   points last week i encountered the thing which decided me how to kill
   moore a party from uganda brought in a black with a queer illness
   which i cant yet diagnose he was lethargic with a very low
   temperature and shuffled in a peculiar way most of the others were
   afraid of him and said he was under some kind of witchdoctor spell;
   but gobo the interpreter said he had been bitten by an insect what
   it was i cant imaginefor there is only a slight puncture on the
   arm it is bright red though with a purple ring around it
   spectrallookingi dont wonder the boys lay it to black magic they
   seem to have seen cases like it before and say theres really nothing
   to do about it old nkuru one of the galla boys at the post says it
   must be the bite of a devilfly which makes its victim waste away
   gradually and die and then takes hold of his soul and personality if
   it is still alive itselfflying around with all his likes dislikes
   and consciousness a queer legendand i dont know of any local insect
   deadly enough to account for it i gave this sick blackhis name is
   mevanaa good shot of quinine and took a sample of his blood for
   testing but havent made much progress there is certainly a strange
   germ present but i cant even remotely identify it the nearest thing
   to it is the bacillus one finds in oxen horses and dogs that the
   tsetsefly has bitten; but tsetseflies dont infect human beings and
   this is too far north for them anyway howeverthe important thing is
   that ive decided how to kill moore if this interior region has
   insects as poisonous as the natives say ill see that he gets a
   shipment of them from a source he wont suspect and with plenty of
   assurances that they are harmless trust him to throw overboard all
   caution when it comes to studying an unknown speciesand then well
   see how nature takes its course! it ought not to be hard to find an
   insect that scares the blacks so much first to see how poor mevana
   turns outand then to find my envoy of death jan 7mevana is no
   better though i have injected all the antitoxins i know of he has
   fits of trembling in which he rants affrightedly about the way his
   soul will pass when he dies into the insect that bit him but between
   them he remains in a kind of halfstupor heart action still strong so
   i may pull him through i shall try to for he can probably guide me
   better than anyone else to the region where he was bitten meanwhile
   ill write to dr lincoln my predecessor here for allen the head
   factor says he had a profound knowledge of the local sicknesses he
   ought to know about the deathfly if any white man does hes at
   nairobi now and a black runner ought to get me a reply in a
   weekusing the railway for half the trip jan 10patient unchanged
   but i have found what i want! it was in an old volume of the local
   health records which ive been going over diligently while waiting to
   hear from lincoln thirty years ago there was an epidemic that killed
   off thousands of natives in uganda and it was definitely traced to a
   rare fly called glossina palpalisa sort of cousin of the glossina
   marsitans or tsetse it lives in the bushes on the shores of lakes and
   rivers and feeds on the blood of crocodiles antelopes and large
   mammals when these food animals have the germ of trypanosomiasis or
   sleepingsickness it picks it up and develops acute infectivity after
   an incubation period of thirtyone days then for seventyfive days it
   is sure death to anyone or anything it bites without doubt this must
   be the devilfly the niggers talk about now i know what im heading
   for hope mevana pulls through ought to hear from lincoln in four or
   five dayshe has a great reputation for success in things like this
   my worst problem will be to get the flies to moore without his
   recognising them with his cursed plodding scholarship it would be just
   like him to know all about them since theyre actually on record jan
   15just heard from lincoln who confirms all that the records say
   about glossina palpalis he has a remedy for sleepingsickness which
   has succeeded in a great number of cases when not given too late
   intermuscular injections of tryparsamide since mevana was bitten about
   two months ago i dont know how it will workbut lincoln says that
   cases have been known to drag on eighteen months so possibly im not
   too late lincoln sent over some of his stuff so ive just given
   mevana a stiff shot in a stupor now theyve brought his principal
   wife from the village but he doesnt even recognise her if he
   recovers he can certainly shew me where the flies are hes a great
   crocodile hunter according to report and knows all uganda like a
   book ill give him another shot tomorrow jan 16mevana seems a
   little brighter today but his heart action is slowing up a bit ill
   keep up the injections but not overdo them jan 17recovery really
   pronounced today mevana opened his eyes and shewed signs of actual
   consciousness though dazed after the injection hope moore doesnt
   know about tryparsamide theres a good chance he wont since he never
   leaned much toward medicine mevanas tongue seemed paralysed but i
   fancy that will pass off if i can only wake him up wouldnt mind a
   good sleep myself but not of this kind! jan 25mevana nearly cured!
   in another week i can let him take me into the jungle he was
   frightened when he first came toabout having the fly take his
   personality after he diedbut brightened up finally when i told him he
   was going to get well his wife ugowe takes good care of him now and
   i can rest a bit then for the envoys of death! feb 3mevana is well
   now and i have talked with him about a hunt for flies he dreads to go
   near the place where they got him but i am playing on his gratitude
   besides he has an idea that i can ward off disease as well as cure it
   his pluck would shame a white mantheres no doubt that hell go i
   can get off by telling the head factor the trip is in the interest of
   local health work march 12in uganda at last! have five boys besides
   mevana but they are all gallas the local blacks couldnt be hired to
   come near the region after the talk of what had happened to mevana
   this jungle is a pestilential placesteaming with miasmal vapours all
   the lakes look stagnant in one spot we came upon a trace of cyclopean
   ruins which made even the gallas run past in a wide circle they say
   these megaliths are older than man and that they used to be a haunt or
   outpost of the fishers from outsidewhatever that meansand of the
   evil gods tsadogwa and clulu to this day they are said to have a
   malign influence and to be connected somehow with the devilflies
   march 15struck lake mlolo this morningwhere mevana was bitten a
   hellish greenscummed affair full of crocodiles mevana has fixed up
   a flytrap of fine wire netting baited with crocodile meat it has a
   small entrance and once the quarry get in they dont know enough to
   get out as stupid as they are deadly and ravenous for fresh meat or a
   bowl of blood hope we can get a good supply ive decided that i must
   experiment with themfinding a way to change their appearance so that
   moore wont recognise them possibly i can cross them with some other
   species producing a strange hybrid whose infectioncarrying capacity
   will be undiminished well see i must wait but am in no hurry now
   when i get ready ill have mevana get me some infected meat to feed my
   envoys of deathand then for the postoffice ought to be no trouble
   getting infection for this country is a veritable pesthole march
   16good luck two cages full five vigorous specimens with wings
   glistening like diamonds mevana is emptying them into a large can with
   a tightly meshed top and i think we caught them in the nick of time
   we can get them to mgonga without trouble taking plenty of crocodile
   meat for their food undoubtedly all or most of it is infected april
   20back at mgonga and busy in the laboratory have sent to dr joost
   in pretoria for some tsetseflies for hybridisation experiments such a
   crossing if it will work at all ought to produce something pretty
   hard to recognise yet at the same time just as deadly as the palpalis
   if this doesnt work i shall try certain other diptera from the
   interior and i have sent to dr vandervelde at nyangwe for some of the
   congo types i shant have to send mevana for more tainted meat after
   all; for i find i can keep cultures of the germ trypanosoma gambiense
   taken from the meat we got last month almost indefinitely in tubes
   when the time comes ill taint some fresh meat and feed my winged
   envoys a good dosethen bon voyage to them! june 18my tsetseflies
   from joost came today cages for breeding were all ready long ago and
   i am now making selections intend to use ultraviolet rays to speed up
   the lifecycle fortunately i have the needed apparatus in my regular
   equipment naturally i tell no one what im doing the ignorance of the
   few men here makes it easy for me to conceal my aims and pretend to be
   merely studying existing species for medical reasons june 29the
   crossing is fertile! good deposits of eggs last wednesday and now i
   have some excellent larvae if the mature insects look as strange as
   these do i need do nothing more am preparing separate numbered cages
   for the different specimens july 7new hybrids are out! disguise is
   excellent as to shape but sheen of wings still suggests palpalis
   thorax has faint suggestions of the stripes of the tsetse slight
   variation in individuals am feeding them all on tainted crocodile
   meat and after infectivity develops will try them on some of the
   blacksapparently of course by accident there are so many mildly
   venomous flies around here that it can easily be done without exciting
   suspicion i shall loose an insect in my tightly screened diningroom
   when batta my houseboy brings in breakfastkeeping well on guard
   myself when it has done its work ill capture or swat itan easy
   thing because of its stupidityor asphyxiate it by filling the room
   with chlorine gas if it doesnt work the first time ill try again
   until it does of course ill have the tryparsamide handy in case i
   get bitten myselfbut i shall be careful to avoid biting for no
   antidote is really certain aug 10infectivity mature and managed to
   get batta stung in fine shape caught the fly on him returning it to
   its cage eased up the pain with iodine and the poor devil is quite
   grateful for the service shall try a variant specimen on gamba the
   factors messenger tomorrow that will be all the tests i shall dare
   to make here but if i need more i shall take some specimens to ukala
   and get additional data aug 11failed to get gamba but recaptured
   the fly alive batta still seems as well as usual and has no pain in
   the back where he was stung shall wait before trying to get gamba
   again aug 14shipment of insects from vandervelde at last fully
   seven distinct species some more or less poisonous am keeping them
   well fed in case the tsetse crossing doesnt work some of these
   fellows look very unlike the palpalis but the trouble is that they may
   not make a fertile cross with it aug 17got gamba this afternoon
   but had to kill the fly on him it nipped him in the left shoulder i
   dressed the bite and gamba is as grateful as batta was no change in
   batta aug 20gamba unchanged so farbatta too am experimenting
   with a new form of disguise to supplement the hybridisationsome sort
   of dye to change the telltale glitter of the palpalis wings a bluish
   tint would be bestsomething i could spray on a whole batch of
   insects shall begin by investigating things like prussian and
   turnbulls blueiron and cyanogen salts aug 25batta complained of
   a pain in his back todaythings may be developing sept 3have made
   fair progress in my experiments batta shews signs of lethargy and
   says his back aches all the time gamba beginning to feel uneasy in his
   bitten shoulder sept 24batta worse and worse and beginning to get
   frightened about his bite thinks it must be a devilfly and entreated
   me to kill itfor he saw me cage ituntil i pretended to him that it
   had died long ago said he didnt want his soul to pass into it upon
   his death i give him shots of plain water with a hypodermic to keep
   his morale up evidently the fly retains all the properties of the
   palpalis gamba down too and repeating all of battas symptoms i may
   decide to give him a chance with tryparsamide for the effect of the
   fly is proved well enough i shall let batta go on however for i want
   a rough idea of how long it takes to finish a case dye experiments
   coming along finely an isomeric form of ferrous ferrocyanide with
   some admixture of potassium salts can be dissolved in alcohol and
   sprayed on the insects with splendid effect it stains the wings blue
   without affecting the dark thorax much and doesnt wear off when i
   sprinkle the specimens with water with this disguise i think i can
   use the present tsetse hybrids and avoid bothering with any more
   experiments sharp as he is moore couldnt recognise a bluewinged fly
   with a halftsetse thorax of course i keep all this dye business
   strictly under cover nothing must ever connect me with the blue flies
   later on oct 9batta is lethargic and has taken to his bed have
   been giving gamba tryparsamide for two weeks and fancy hell recover
   oct 25batta very low but gamba nearly well nov 18batta died
   yesterday and a curious thing happened which gave me a real shiver in
   view of the native legends and battas own fears when i returned to
   the laboratory after the death i heard the most singular buzzing and
   thrashing in cage 12 which contained the fly that bit batta the
   creature seemed frantic but stopped still when i appearedlighting on
   the wire netting and looking at me in the oddest way it reached its
   legs through the wires as if it were bewildered when i came back from
   dining with allen the thing was dead evidently it had gone wild and
   beaten its life out on the sides of the cage it certainly is peculiar
   that this should happen just as batta died if any black had seen it
   hed have laid it at once to the absorption of the poor devils soul i
   shall start my bluestained hybrids on their way before long now the
   hybrids rate of killing seems a little ahead of the pure palpalis
   rate if anything batta died three months and eight days after
   infectionbut of course there is always a wide margin of uncertainty
   i almost wish i had let gambas case run on dec 5busy planning how
   to get my envoys to moore i must have them appear to come from some
   disinterested entomologist who has read his diptera of central and
   southern africa and believes he would like to study this new and
   unidentifiable species there must also be ample assurances that the
   bluewinged fly is harmless as proved by the natives long experience
   moore will be off his guard and one of the flies will surely get him
   sooner or laterthough one cant tell just when ill have to rely on
   the letters of new york friendsthey still speak of moore from time to
   timeto keep me informed of early results though i dare say the
   papers will announce his death above all i must shew no interest in
   his case i shall mail the flies while on a trip but must not be
   recognised when i do it the best plan will be to take a long vacation
   in the interior grow a beard mail the package at ukala while passing
   as a visiting entomologist and return here after shaving off the
   beard april 12 1930back in mgonga after my long trip everything
   has come off finelywith clockwork precision have sent the flies to
   moore without leaving a trace got a christmas vacation dec 15th and
   set out at once with the proper stuff made a very good mailing
   container with room to include some germtainted crocodile meat as food
   for the envoys by the end of february i had beard enough to shape into
   a close vandyke shewed up at ukala march 9th and typed a letter to
   moore on the tradingpost machine signed it nevil
   waylandhallsupposed to be an entomologist from london think i took
   just the right toneinterest of a brotherscientist and all that was
   artistically casual in emphasising the complete harmlessness of the
   specimens nobody suspected anything shaved the beard as soon as i hit
   the bush so that there wouldnt be any uneven tanning by the time i
   got back here dispensed with native bearers except for one small
   stretch of swampi can do wonders with one knapsack and my sense of
   direction is good lucky im used to such travelling explained my
   protracted absence by pleading a touch of fever and some mistakes in
   direction when going through the bush but now comes the hardest part
   psychologicallywaiting for news of moore without shewing the strain
   of course he may possibly escape a bite until the venom is played
   outbut with his recklessness the chances are one hundred to one
   against him i have no regrets; after what he did to me he deserves
   this and more june 30 1930hurrah! the first step worked! just heard
   casually from dyson of columbia that moore had received some new
   bluewinged flies from africa and that he is badly puzzled over them!
   no word of any bitebut if i know moores slipshod ways as i think i
   do therell be one before long! august 27 1930letter from morton in
   cambridge he says moore writes of feeling very rundown and tells of
   an insect bite on the back of his neckfrom a curious new specimen
   that he received about the middle of june have i succeeded? apparently
   moore doesnt connect the bite with his weakness if this is the real
   stuff then moore was bitten well within the insects period of
   infectivity sept 12 1930victory! another line from dyson says that
   moore is really in an alarming shape he now traces his illness to the
   bite which he received around noon on june 19 and is quite bewildered
   about the identity of the insect is trying to get in touch with the
   nevil waylandhall who sent him the shipment of the hundredodd that
   i sent about twentyfive seem to have reached him alive some escaped
   at the time of the bite but several larvae have appeared from eggs
   laid since the time of mailing he is dyson says carefully incubating
   these larvae when they mature i suppose hell identify the
   tsetsepalpalis hybridisationbut that wont do him much good now
   hell wonder though why the blue wings arent transmitted by
   heredity! nov 8 1930letters from half a dozen friends tell of
   moores serious illness dysons came today he says moore is utterly
   at sea about the hybrids that came from the larvae and is beginning to
   think that the parents got their blue wings in some artificial way has
   to stay in bed most of the time now no mention of using tryparsamide
   feb 13 1931not so good! moore is sinking and seems to know no
   remedy but i think he suspects me had a very chilly letter from
   morton last month which told nothing of moore; and now dyson
   writesalso rather constrainedlythat moore is forming theories about
   the whole matter hes been making a search for waylandhall by
   telegraphat london ukala nairobi mombasa and other placesand of
   course finds nothing i judge that hes told dyson whom he suspects
   but that dyson doesnt believe it yet fear morton does believe it i
   see that id better lay plans for getting out of here and effacing my
   identity for good what an end to a career that started out so well!
   more of moores workbut this time hes paying for it in advance!
   believe ill go back to south africaand meanwhile will quietly
   deposit funds there to the credit of my new selffrederick nasmyth
   mason of toronto canada broker in mining properties will establish
   a new signature for identification if i never have to take the step i
   can easily retransfer the funds to my present self aug 15
   1931half a year gone and still suspense dyson and mortonas well
   as several other friendsseem to have stopped writing me dr james of
   san francisco hears from moores friends now and then and says moore
   is in an almost continuous coma he hasnt been able to walk since may
   as long as he could talk he complained of being cold now he cant
   talk though it is thought he still has glimmers of consciousness his
   breathing is short and quick and can be heard some distance away no
   question but that trypanosoma gambiense is feeding on himbut he holds
   out better than the niggers around here three months and eight days
   finished batta and here moore is alive over a year after his biting
   heard rumours last month of an intensive search around ukala for
   waylandhall dont think i need to worry yet though for theres
   absolutely nothing in existence to link me with this business oct 7
   1931its over at last! news in the mombasa gazette moore died
   september 20 after a series of trembling fits and with a temperature
   vastly below normal so much for that! i said id get him and i did!
   the paper had a threecolumn report of his long illness and death and
   of the futile search for waylandhall obviously moore was a bigger
   character in africa than i had realised the insect that bit him has
   now been fully identified from the surviving specimens and developed
   larvae and the wingstaining is also detected it is universally
   realised that the flies were prepared and shipped with intent to kill
   moore it appears communicated certain suspicions to dyson but the
   latterand the policeare maintaining secrecy because of absence of
   proof all of moores enemies are being looked up and the associated
   press hints that an investigation possibly involving an eminent
   physician now abroad will follow one thing at the very end of the
   reportundoubtedly the cheap romancing of a yellow journalistgives
   me a curious shudder in view of the legends of the blacks and the way
   the fly happened to go wild when batta died it seems that an odd
   incident occurred on the night of moores death; dyson having been
   aroused by the buzzing of a bluewinged flywhich immediately flew out
   the windowjust before the nurse telephoned the death news from
   moores home miles away in brooklyn but what concerns me most is the
   african end of the matter people at ukala remember the bearded
   stranger who typed the letter and sent the package and the
   constabulary are combing the country for any blacks who may have
   carried him i didnt use many but if officers question the ubandes
   who took me through nkini jungle belt ill have more to explain than i
   like it looks as if the time has come for me to vanish; so tomorrow i
   believe ill resign and prepare to start for parts unknown nov 9
   1931hard work getting my resignation acted on but release came
   today i didnt want to aggravate suspicion by decamping outright last
   week i heard from james about moores deathbut nothing more than is
   in the papers those around him in new york seem rather reticent about
   details though they all talk about a searching investigation no word
   from any of my friends in the east moore must have spread some
   dangerous suspicions around before he lost consciousnessbut there
   isnt an iota of proof he could have adduced still i am taking no
   chances on thursday i shall start for mombasa and when there will
   take a steamer down the coast to durban after that i shall drop from
   sightbut soon afterward the mining properties broker frederick
   nasmyth mason from toronto will turn up in johannesburg let this be
   the end of my journal if in the end i am not suspected it will serve
   its original purpose after my death and reveal what would otherwise not
   be known if on the other hand these suspicions do materialise and
   persist it will confirm and clarify the vague charges and fill in
   many important and puzzling gaps of course if danger comes my way i
   shall have to destroy it well moore is deadas he amply deserves to
   be now dr thomas slauenwite is dead too and when the body formerly
   belonging to thomas slauenwite is dead the public may have this
   record

   ii

   jan 15 1932a new yearand a reluctant reopening of this journal
   this time i am writing solely to relieve my mind for it would be
   absurd to fancy that the case is not definitely closed i am settled in
   the vaal hotel johannesburg under my new name and no one has so far
   challenged my identity have had some inconclusive business talks to
   keep up my part as a mine broker and believe i may actually work
   myself into that business later i shall go to toronto and plant a few
   evidences for my fictitious past but what is bothering me is an insect
   that invaded my room around noon today of course i have had all sorts
   of nightmares about blue flies of late but those were only to be
   expected in view of my prevailing nervous strain this thing however
   was a waking actuality and i am utterly at a loss to account for it
   it buzzed around my bookshelf for fully a quarter of an hour and
   eluded every attempt to catch or kill it the queerest thing was its
   colour and aspectfor it had blue wings and was in every way a
   duplicate of my hybrid envoys of death how it could possibly be one of
   these in fact i certainly dont know i disposed of all the
   hybridsstained and unstainedthat i didnt send to moore and cant
   recall any instance of escape can this be wholly an hallucination? or
   could any of the specimens that escaped in brooklyn when moore was
   bitten have found their way back to africa? there was that absurd story
   of the blue fly that waked dyson when moore diedbut after all the
   survival and return of some of the things is not impossible it is
   perfectly plausible that the blue should stick to their wings too for
   the pigment i devised was almost as good as tattooing for permanence
   by elimination that would seem to be the only rational explanation for
   this thing; though it is very curious that the fellow has come as far
   south as this possibly its some hereditary homing instinct inherent
   in the tsetse strain after all that side of him belongs to south
   africa i must be on my guard against a bite of course the original
   venomif this is actually one of the flies that escaped from
   moorewas worn out ages ago; but the fellow must have fed as he flew
   back from america and he may well have come through central africa and
   picked up a fresh infectivity indeed thats more probable than not;
   for the palpalis half of his heredity would naturally take him back to
   uganda and all the trypanosomiasis germs i still have some of the
   tryparsamide lefti couldnt bear to destroy my medicine case
   incriminating though it may bebut since reading up on the subject i
   am not so sure about the drugs action as i was it gives one a
   fighting chancecertainly it saved gambabut theres always a large
   probability of failure its devilish queer that this fly should have
   happened to come into my roomof all places in the wide expanse of
   africa! seems to strain coincidence to the breakingpoint i suppose
   that if it comes again i shall certainly kill it im surprised that
   it escaped me today for ordinarily these fellows are extremely stupid
   and easy to catch can it be a pure illusion after all? certainly the
   heat is getting me of late as it never did beforeeven up around
   uganda jan 16am i going insane? the fly came again this noon and
   acted so anomalously that i cant make head or tail of it only
   delusion on my part could account for what that buzzing pest seemed to
   do it appeared from nowhere and went straight to my
   bookshelfcircling again and again to front a copy of moores diptera
   of central and southern africa now and then it would light on top or
   back of the volume and occasionally it would dart forward toward me
   and retreat before i could strike at it with a folded paper such
   cunning is unheard of among the notoriously stupid african diptera for
   nearly half an hour i tried to get the cursed thing but at last it
   darted out the window through a hole in the screen that i hadnt
   noticed at times i fancied it deliberately mocked me by coming within
   reach of my weapon and then skilfully sidestepping as i struck out i
   must keep a tight hold of my consciousness jan 17either i am mad or
   the world is in the grip of some sudden suspension of the laws of
   probability as we know them that damnable fly came in from somewhere
   just before noon and commenced buzzing around the copy of moores
   diptera on my shelf again i tried to catch it and again yesterdays
   experience was repeated finally the pest made for the open inkwell on
   my table and dipped itself injust the legs and thorax keeping its
   wings clear then it sailed up to the ceiling and litbeginning to
   crawl around in a curved patch and leaving a trail of ink after a time
   it hopped a bit and made a single ink spot unconnected with the
   trailthen it dropped squarely in front of my face and buzzed out of
   sight before i could get it something about this whole business struck
   me as monstrously sinister and abnormalmore so than i could explain
   to myself when i looked at the inktrail on the ceiling from different
   angles it seemed more and more familiar to me and it dawned on me
   suddenly that it formed an absolutely perfect questionmark what
   device could be more malignly appropriate? it is a wonder that i did
   not faint so far the hotel attendants have not noticed it have not
   seen the fly this afternoon and evening but am keeping my inkwell
   securely closed i think my extermination of moore must be preying on
   me and giving me morbid hallucinations perhaps there is no fly at
   all jan 18into what strange hell of living nightmare am i plunged?
   what occurred today is something which could not normally happenand
   yet an hotel attendant has seen the marks on the ceiling and concedes
   their reality about eleven oclock this morning as i was writing on a
   manuscript something darted down to the inkwell for a second and
   flashed aloft again before i could see what it was looking up i saw
   that hellish fly on the ceiling as it had been beforecrawling along
   and tracing another trail of curves and turns there was nothing i
   could do but i folded a newspaper in readiness to get the creature if
   it should fly near enough when it had made several turns on the
   ceiling it flew into a dark corner and disappeared and as i looked
   upward at the doubly defaced plastering i saw that the new inktrail
   was that of a huge and unmistakable figure 5! for a time i was almost
   unconscious from a wave of nameless menace for which i could not fully
   account then i summoned up my resolution and took an active step
   going out to a chemists shop i purchased some gum and other things
   necessary for preparing a sticky trapalso a duplicate inkwell
   returning to my room i filled the new inkwell with the sticky mixture
   and set it where the old one had been leaving it open then i tried to
   concentrate my mind on some reading about three oclock i heard the
   accursed insect again and saw it circling around the new inkwell it
   descended to the sticky surface but did not touch it and afterward
   sailed straight toward meretreating before i could hit it then it
   went to the bookshelf and circled around moores treatise there is
   something profound and diabolic about the way the intruder hovers near
   that book the worst part was the last leaving moores book the
   insect flew over to the open window and began beating itself
   rhythmically against the wire screen there would be a series of beats
   and then a series of equal length and another pause and so on
   something about this performance held me motionless for a couple of
   moments but after that i went over to the window and tried to kill the
   noxious thing as usual no use it merely flew across the room to a
   lamp and began beating the same tattoo on the stiff cardboard shade i
   felt a vague desperation and proceeded to shut all the doors as well
   as the window whose screen had the imperceptible hole it seemed very
   necessary to kill this persistent being whose hounding was rapidly
   unseating my mind then unconsciously counting i began to notice that
   each of its series of beatings contained just five strokes fivethe
   same number that the thing had traced in ink on the ceiling in the
   morning! could there be any conceivable connexion? the notion was
   maniacal for that would argue a human intellect and a knowledge of
   written figures in the hybrid fly a human intellectdid not that take
   one back to the most primitive legends of the uganda blacks? and yet
   there was that infernal cleverness in eluding me as contrasted with the
   normal stupidity of the breed as i laid aside my folded paper and sat
   down in growing horror the insect buzzed aloft and disappeared through
   a hole in the ceiling where the radiator pipe went to the room above
   the departure did not soothe me for my mind had started on a train of
   wild and terrible reflections if this fly had a human intelligence
   where did that intelligence come from? was there any truth in the
   native notion that these creatures acquire the personality of their
   victims after the latters death? if so whose personality did this fly
   bear? i had reasoned out that it must be one of those which escaped
   from moore at the time he was bitten was this the envoy of death which
   had bitten moore? if so what did it want with me? what did it want
   with me anyway? in a cold perspiration i remembered the actions of the
   fly that had bitten batta when batta died had its own personality been
   displaced by that of its dead victim? then there was that sensational
   news account of the fly that waked dyson when moore died as for that
   fly that was hounding mecould it be that a vindictive human
   personality drove it on? how it hovered around moores book!i refused
   to think any farther than that all at once i began to feel sure that
   the creature was indeed infected and in the most virulent way with a
   malign deliberation so evident in every act it must surely have
   charged itself on purpose with the deadliest bacilli in all africa my
   mind thoroughly shaken was now taking the things human qualities for
   granted i now telephoned the clerk and asked for a man to stop up the
   radiator pipehole and other possible chinks in my room i spoke of
   being tormented by flies and he seemed to be quite sympathetic when
   the man came i shewed him the inkmarks on the ceiling which he
   recognised without difficulty so they are real! the resemblance to a
   questionmark and a figure 5 puzzled and fascinated him in the end he
   stopped up all the holes he could find and mended the windowscreen
   so that i can now keep both windows open he evidently thought me a bit
   eccentric especially since no insects were in sight while he was here
   but i am past minding that so far the fly has not appeared this
   evening god knows what it is what it wants or what will become of
   me! jan 19i am utterly engulfed in horror the thing has touched me
   something monstrous and daemoniac is at work around me and i am a
   helpless victim in the morning when i returned from breakfast that
   winged fiend from hell brushed into the room over my head and began
   beating itself against the windowscreen as it did yesterday this
   time though each series of beats contained only four strokes i
   rushed to the window and tried to catch it but it escaped as usual and
   flew over to moores treatise where it buzzed around mockingly its
   vocal equipment is limited but i noticed that its spells of buzzing
   came in groups of four by this time i was certainly mad for i called
   out to it moore moore for gods sake what do you want? when i did
   so the creature suddenly ceased its circling flew toward me and made
   a low graceful dip in the air somehow suggestive of a bow then it
   flew back to the book at least i seemed to see it do all thisthough
   i am trusting my senses no longer and then the worst thing happened i
   had left my door open hoping the monster would leave if i could not
   catch it; but about 11:30 i shut the door concluding it had gone then
   i settled down to read just at noon i felt a tickling on the back of
   my neck but when i put my hand up nothing was there in a moment i
   felt the tickling againand before i could move that nameless spawn
   of hell sailed into view from behind did another of those mocking
   graceful dips in the air and flew out through the keyholewhich i had
   never dreamed was large enough to allow its passage that the thing had
   touched me i could not doubt it had touched me without injuring
   meand then i remembered in a sudden cold fright that moore had been
   bitten on the back of the neck at noon no invasion since thenbut i
   have stuffed all the keyholes with paper and shall have a folded paper
   ready for use whenever i open the door to leave or enter jan 20i
   cannot yet believe fully in the supernatural yet i fear none the less
   that i am lost the business is too much for me just before noon today
   that devil appeared outside the window and repeated its beating
   operations; but this time in series of three when i went to the window
   it flew off out of sight i still have resolution enough to take one
   more defensive step removing both windowscreens i coated them with
   my sticky preparationthe one i used in the inkwelloutside and
   inside and set them back in place if that creature attempts another
   tattoo it will be its last! rest of the day in peace can i weather
   this experience without becoming a maniac? jan 21on board train for
   bloemfontein i am routed the thing is winning it has a diabolic
   intelligence against which all my devices are powerless it appeared
   outside the window this morning but did not touch the sticky screen
   instead it sheered off without lighting and began buzzing around in
   circlestwo at a time followed by a pause in the air after several
   of these performances it flew off out of sight over the roofs of the
   city my nerves are just about at the breakingpoint for these
   suggestions of numbers are capable of a hideous interpretation monday
   the thing dwelt on the figure five; tuesday it was four; wednesday it
   was three; and now today it is two five four three twowhat can
   this be save some monstrous and unthinkable countingoff of days? for
   what purpose only the evil powers of the universe can know i spent
   all the afternoon packing and arranging about my trunks and now i have
   taken the night express for bloemfontein flight may be useless but
   what else can one do? jan 22settled at the orange hotel
   bloemfonteina comfortable and excellent placebut the horror
   followed me i had shut all the doors and windows stopped all the
   keyholes looked for any possible chinks and pulled down all the
   shadesbut just before noon i heard a dull tap on one of the
   windowscreens i waitedand after a long pause another tap came a
   second pause and still another single tap raising the shade i saw
   that accursed fly as i had expected it described one large slow
   circle in the air and then flew out of sight i was left as weak as a
   rag and had to rest on the couch one! this was clearly the burden of
   the monsters present message one tap one circle did this mean one
   more day for me before some unthinkable doom? ought i to flee again or
   entrench myself here by sealing up the room? after an hours rest i
   felt able to act and ordered a large reserve supply of canned and
   packaged foodalso linen and towelssent in tomorrow i shall not
   under any circumstances open any crevice of door or window when the
   food and linen came the black looked at me queerly but i no longer
   care how eccentricor insanei may appear i am hounded by powers
   worse than the ridicule of mankind having received my supplies i went
   over every square millimeter of the walls and stopped up every
   microscopic opening i could find at last i feel able to get real
   sleep (handwriting here becomes irregular nervous and very difficult
   to decipher) jan 23it is just before noon and i feel that something
   very terrible is about to happen didnt sleep as late as i expected
   even though i got almost no sleep on the train the night before up
   early and have had trouble getting concentrated on anythingreading
   or writing that slow deliberate countingoff of days is too much for
   me i dont know which has gone wildnature or my head until about
   eleven i did very little except walk up and down the room then i heard
   a rustle among the food packages brought in yesterday and that
   daemoniac fly crawled out before my eyes i grabbed something flat and
   made passes at the thing despite my panic fear but with no more effect
   than usual as i advanced that bluewinged horror retreated as usual
   to the table where i had piled my books and lit for a second on
   moores diptera of central and southern africa then as i followed it
   flew over to the mantel clock and lit on the dial near the figure 12
   before i could think up another move it had begun to crawl around the
   dial very slowly and deliberatelyin the direction of the hands it
   passed under the minute hand curved down and up passed under the hour
   hand and finally came to a stop exactly at the figure 12 as it
   hovered there it fluttered its wings with a buzzing noise is this a
   portent of some sort? i am getting as superstitious as the blacks the
   hour is now a little after eleven is twelve the end? i have just one
   last resort brought to my mind through utter desperation wish i had
   thought of it before recalling that my medicine case contains both of
   the substances necessary to generate chlorine gas i have resolved to
   fill the room with that lethal vapourasphyxiating the fly while
   protecting myself with an ammoniasealed handkerchief tied over my
   face fortunately i have a good supply of ammonia this crude mask will
   probably neutralise the acrid chlorine fumes till the insect is
   deador at least helpless enough to crush but i must be quick how
   can i be sure that the thing will not suddenly dart for me before my
   preparations are complete? i ought not to be stopping to write in this
   journal laterboth chemicalshydrochloric acid and manganese
   dioxideon the table all ready to mix ive tied the handkerchief over
   my nose and mouth and have a bottle of ammonia ready to keep it soaked
   until the chlorine is gone have battened down both windows but i
   dont like the actions of that hybrid daemon it stays on the clock
   but is very slowly crawling around backward from the 12 mark to meet
   the gradually advancing minutehand is this to be my last entry in
   this journal? it would be useless to try to deny what i suspect too
   often a grain of incredible truth lurks behind the wildest and most
   fantastic of legends is the personality of henry moore trying to get
   at me through this bluewinged devil? is this the fly that bit him and
   that in consequence absorbed his consciousness when he died? if so and
   if it bites me will my own personality displace moores and enter that
   buzzing body when i die of the bite later on? perhaps though i need
   not die even if it gets me there is always a chance with tryparsamide
   and i regret nothing moore had to die be the outcome what it will
   slightly later the fly has paused on the clockdial near the 45minute
   mark it is now 11:30 i am saturating the handkerchief over my face
   with ammonia and keeping the bottle handy for further applications
   this will be the final entry before i mix the acid and manganese and
   liberate the chlorine i ought not to be losing time but it steadies
   me to get things down on paper but for this record id have lost all
   my reason long ago the fly seems to be getting restless and the
   minutehand is approaching it now for the chlorine   

   (end of the journal)

   on sunday jan 24 1932 after repeated knocking had failed to gain
   any response from the eccentric man in room 303 of the orange hotel a
   black attendant entered with a pass key and at once fled shrieking
   downstairs to tell the clerk what he had found the clerk after
   notifying the police summoned the manager; and the latter accompanied
   constable de witt coroner bogaert and dr van keulen to the fatal
   room the occupant lay dead on the floorhis face upward and bound
   with a handkerchief which smelled strongly of ammonia under this
   covering the features shewed an expression of stark utter fear which
   transmitted itself to the observers on the back of the neck dr van
   keulen found a virulent insect bitedark red with a purple ring
   around itwhich suggested a tsetsefly or something less innocuous an
   examination indicated that death must be due to heartfailure induced
   by sheer fright rather than to the bitethough a subsequent autopsy
   indicated that the germ of trypanosomiasis had been introduced into the
   system on the table were several objectsa worn leather blankbook
   containing the journal just described a pen writingpad and open
   inkwell a doctors medicine case with the initials t s marked in
   gold bottles of ammonia and hydrochloric acid and a tumbler about a
   quarter full of black manganese dioxide the ammonia bottle demanded a
   second look because something besides the fluid seemed to be in it
   looking closer coroner bogaert saw that the alien occupant was a fly
   it seemed to be some sort of hybrid with vague tsetse affiliations but
   its wingsshewing faintly blue despite the action of the strong
   ammoniawere a complete puzzle something about it waked a faint
   memory of newspaper reading in dr van keulena memory which the
   journal was soon to confirm its lower parts seemed to have been
   stained with ink so thoroughly that even the ammonia had not bleached
   them possibly it had fallen at one time into the inkwell though the
   wings were untouched but how had it managed to fall into the
   narrownecked ammonia bottle? it was as if the creature had
   deliberately crawled in and committed suicide! but the strangest thing
   of all was what constable de witt noticed on the smooth white ceiling
   overhead as his eyes roved about curiously at his cry the other three
   followed his gazeeven dr van keulen who had for some time been
   thumbing through the worn leather book with an expression of mixed
   horror fascination and incredulity the thing on the ceiling was a
   series of shaky straggling inktracks such as might have been made by
   the crawling of some inkdrenched insect at once everyone thought of
   the stains on the fly so oddly found in the ammonia bottle but these
   were no ordinary inktracks even a first glance revealed something
   hauntingly familiar about them and closer inspection brought gasps of
   startled wonder from all four observers coroner bogaert instinctively
   looked around the room to see if there were any conceivable instrument
   or arrangement of piledup furniture which could make it possible for
   those straggling marks to have been drawn by human agency finding
   nothing of the sort he resumed his curious and almost awestruck upward
   glance for beyond a doubt these inky smudges formed definite letters
   of the alphabetletters coherently arranged in english words the
   doctor was the first to make them out clearly and the others listened
   breathlessly as he recited the insanesounding message so incredibly
   scrawled in a place no human hand could reach:
   see my journalit got me firsti diedthen i saw i was in itthe blacks
are rightstrange powers in naturenow i will drown what is left

   presently amidst the puzzled hush that followed dr van keulen
   commenced reading aloud from the worn leather journal
