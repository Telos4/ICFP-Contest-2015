The 18th annual @icfp_conference Programming Contest site is live.  The contest will take place 7-9 Aug 2015.  http://icfpcontest.org

The Turing Squad is thin on the ground. AS2H2 is now recruiting!

AS2H2 takes no position on the applicability of particular programming languages to our rather specialized problem domain.
When we give tours at Galois, a common question is, "Why is there a watermelon there?"
That damned agro-industrial complex! If only they knew... http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572#public … 
אין זיין הויז בייַ ר'ליעה טויט קטהולהו ווייץ דרימינג.
Our linguists inform us that the text we sent in our previous tweet is of Yiddish origin.
Less than 5 hours to go... enough for a nap, if we could ever sleep again after the things we've seen. Perhaps we'll do the laundry instead.
And we are…. live. http://www.icfpcontest.org  And they are… listening.
Email icfpcontest2015@gmail.com (or tweet to @ICFPContest2015, for public disclosure) if you have questions, comments, or exhortations.
While the standard evaluation system is an x86 Linux box, @galois has expertise in every development platform ever, so use any PL you like.
We are investigating team Rabbit House’s regular scoring in excess of 8M. At least it isn’t 10^63… that would be… powerfully frightening.
.@galois personnel running @ICFPContest2015 are now listening in #icfp-contest on http://irc.freenode.net  .
.@galois is a growing excited company.  The future begins tomorrow!
.@machinaut Yes, rotating a 180 degree symmetrical unit by 180 degrees causes an error.
.@machinaut The Old Ones care not for mitigating factors such as rotational symmetry.
AS2H2 has posted some clarifications and rule updates on http://icfpcontest.org/  
. Twitter-length summaries follow.
CLARIFICATION: A sequence of commands that continues after the game ends is an error, and results in a score of 0 points.
CLARIFICATION: The sequence of random numbers to be used for unit selection is computed from all generator states, including the seed.
We are enjoying watching contestants search for power phrases, but the Deep Ones discourage cutting & pasting from Wikipedia.
.@smn_theorem Yes. However, we advise against submitting multiple solutions for the _same_ problem and seed in the same POST.
A friendly reminder from AS2H2: power phrase invocations are not included in lightning round scoring...
Contest organizers are monitoring the IRC channel (freenode, #icfp-contest) as galois_joey, galois_kiniry, galois_yav, and galois_dmz.
As of noon PST, we have 205 teams and over 20,000 submissions. The Old Ones may take notice.
AS2H2 has posted more clarifications and rule updates on http://icfpcontest.org/  
. Twitter-length summaries follow.
CLARIFICATION: The command line parameter "-p" is a power word, as a string. To quote, or not to quote, is shell-dependent.
CLARIFICATION: Programs that are killed for violating resource limits (during final judging) will earn scores of 0 for their runs.
CLARIFICATION: Scores on a problem leaderboard are _averages_ of the scores across all seeds for the problem.
.@atzensepp Yes, it is allowed to reuse code from Internet resources if its license allows for such use.
.@imos Specific information on evaluation hardware is unavailable. However, we are currently discussing multiple cores. Stay tuned.
AS2H2 has posted more clarifications and rule updates on http://icfpcontest.org  
. Twitter-length summaries follow.
CLARIFICATION: There is no fixed constraint on board sizes. There is also no fixed constraint on unit sizes.
CHANGE: A command line flag has been added to indicate the number of cores available to a program, for teams that want to parallelize.
CLARIFICATION: We will not provide precise information about resource limits, but guarantee that teams can use their languages of choice.
.@podmostom null means that the solution has not yet been scored. 0 means that it was scored and received 0 points.
.@imos See the 2015-08-07 21:00 UTC clarification on http://www.icfpcontest.org
.@podmostom With threats of otherworldly violence. I.e., disqualification for abuse.
.@Temple_Gates Azathoth and Other Horrors will consume your children for your abuse of our leaderboard. https://davar.icfpcontest.org/leader_board.html …
.@im_aqk All filled rows on the board are cleared when a piece is locked.
NOTIFICATION: A sample play for board 6, seed 0 is now found at http://www.icfpcontest.org
The main contest page has been updated to indicate organizers' IRC presence - #icfp-contest at http://irc.freenode.net 
.@nya3jp You may assume that distinct problems have distinct IDs.
With less than four hours to go in the lightning division, 260 teams are registered and over 76,000 solutions have been submitted.
.@vixentael when judging the lightning division, we will evaluate the source code submissions corresponding to the top scores.
.@vixentael recall that lightning division scoring does not consider phrases of power.
.@iwiwi similar to evaluating the full contest submissions, we will score the submitted solutions to determine the top lightning entries...
.@iwiwi ...we will then build and run them to ensure that they generate solutions. Lightning judging will use only the provided problems.
.@vixentael @iwiwi we intend to score both submitted and generated solutions, but it is not strictly required that they be identical.
.@vixentael @iwiwi should we have questions after running the submitted source code, we have ways of finding you.
It has come to the attention of ██████████ that there is considerable risk of an unintentional summoning event in Vancouver in September.
Because Vancouver borders their domain, ██████████ have invoked the Benthic treaty and demanded extra precautions.
More information will be available as the situation evolves.
There is a disturbence in the ether. A push from beyond is about to transmutate the contest webpages. The lightning has cleared.
The lightning has indeed cleared. Peering into the clouds, we see 280 teams and nearly 142,000 invocations to keep us all safe.
Power phrases must be pronounced precisely, and in their original tongue---not in isomorphism thereof.
.@sanityinc @vixentael you are correct... One file name per "-f".
It has come to our attention that participants have submitted many solutions using seeds that were not provided by AS2H2...
...Unfortunately, this has caused elements of the scoring system evaluating those solutions to be swallowed by the gibbering darkness.
We are taking actions to mitigate this issue by filtering out such unsafe solutions. We hope to have the leaderboard back online soon.
Note that repeatedly submitting solutions with unapproved seeds may lead to... consequences. For you, and anyone within a 10-mile radius.
.@etandel We intend to make all artifacts public after the contest.
.@xlerb An excellent tip. Always good to have more than one tool at hand when fighting back the darkness.
We have restored the leaderboard to what we believe to be full functionality. There may still be some residual quirkiness from its ordeal.
Please alert us to any oddities you notice with the reconstituted leaderboard.
A valid, sample command sequence for problem 6, seed 0 has been posted to http://icfpcontest.org/  . More samples may be forthcoming later.
.@Calvyn82 The board underreports power phrases for some old submissions, though the scores should be correct. Resubmit if you are nervous.
.@edoardoo If you report some details about the anomaly by email, we will dispatch an agent to investigate.
An analysis of the davar invoked so far shows that 14 of 18 phrases of power have been discovered... but no more than 9 by any single team.
The formless spawn have transformed one of the undiscovered words of power, reshaping it in the image of their master!
A bug causing the leaderboard to sometimes report twice the expected score has been fixed. More details on http://icfpcontest.org  soon.
Wrt -t’s max. The contest results will be announced on 1 September at 17:45 PST. We do not have a spare flux capacitor. You do the math.
.@ICFPContest2015 Hints for the remaining handful of davar will be forthcoming. Prepare yourselves for madness.
800 developers, 300 teams, 900,000 solutions submitted thus far. That’s over 425MB of davar. Well done, recruits!
.@TT_Kilew Choose wisely. The fate of the world is in your hands.
.@n12o Still having fun? Wait until the Deep Ones begin scratching at your door.
Early 20th century astronomers were wrong, given the discoveries of New Horizons.  It is not Yuggoth.
What’s worse, according to them, we cannot even continue to call it “Planet 10”. Laugh-a while you can, monkeyboy!
Conway. Cocke. Hopcroft. Backus. Is Bigboote pronounced "big-booty", or "bigboo-tay”? In any case, it is a powerful name.
