   I. Oceanus

   Sometimes I stand upon the shore
   Where ocean vaults their effluence pour,
   And troubled waters sigh and shriek
   Of secrets that they dare not speak.
   From nameless valleys far below,
   And hills and plains no man may know,
   The mystic swells and sullen surges
   Hint like accursed thaumaturges
   A thousand horrors, big with awe,
   That forgotten ages saw.
   O salt, salt winds, that bleakly sweep
   Across the barren heaving deep;
   O wild, wan waves, that call to mind
   The chaos Earth hath left behind;
   Of you I ask one thing alone--
   Leave, leave your ancient lore unknown!

   II. Clouds

   Of late I climb'd a lonely height
   And watch'd the moon-streak'd clouds in flight,
   Whose forms fantastic reel'd and whirl'd
   Like genii of a spectral world.
   Thin cirri veil'd the silv'ry dome
   And waver'd like the ocean foam,
   While shapes of darker, heavier kind
   Scudded before a daemon wind.
   Methought the churning vapours took
   Now and anon a fearsome look,
   As if amidst the fog and blur
   March'd figures known and sinister.
   From west to east the things advanc'd--
   A mocking train that leap'd and danc'd
   Like Bacchanals with joined hands
   In endless file thro' airy lands.
   Aerial mutt'rings, dimly heard,
   The comfort of my spirit stirr'd
   With hideous thoughts, that bade me screen
   My sight form the portentous scene.
   "Yon fleeing mists," the murmurs said,
   "Are ghosts of hopes, deny'd and dead."

   III. Mother Earth

   One night I wander'd down the bank
   Of a deep valley, hush'd and dank,
   Whose stagnant air possess'd a taint
   And chill that made me sick and faint.
   The frequent trees on ev'ry hand
   Loom'd like a ghastly goblin band,
   And branches `gainst the narrowing sky
   Took shapes I fear'd--I knew not why.
   Deeper I plung'd, and seem'd to grope
   For some lost thing as joy or hope,
   Yet found, for all my searchings there,
   Naught save the phantoms of despair.
   The walls contracted as I went
   Still farther in my mad descent,
   Till soon, of moon and stars bereft,
   I crouch'd within a rocky cleft
   So deep and ancient that the stone
   Breath'd things primordial and unknown.
   My hands, exploring, strove to trace
   The features of the valley's face,
   When midst the gloom they seem'd to find
   An outline frightful to my mind.
   Not any shape my straining eyes,
   Could they have seen, might recognize;
   For what I touch'd bespoke a day
   Too old for man's fugacious sway.
   The clinging lichens moist and hoary
   Forbade me read the antique story;
   But hidden water, trickling low,
   Whisper'd the tales I should not know.

   "Mortal, ephemeral and bold,
   In mercy keep what I have told,
   Yet think sometimes of what hath been,
   And sights these crumbling rocks have seen;
   Of sentience old ere thy weak brook
   Appear'd in lesser magnitude,
   And living things that yet servive,
   Tho' not to human ken alive.
   I AM THE VOICE OF MOTHER EARTH,
   FORM WHENCE ALL HORRORS HAVE THEIR BIRTH."

   88179A Reminiscence of Dr. Samuel JohnsonH. P. Lovecraft

   The Privilege of Reminiscence, however rambling or tiresome, is one
   generally allow'd to the very aged; indeed, 'tis frequently by means of
   such Recollections that the obscure occurrences of History, and the
   lesser Anecdotes of the Great, are transmitted to Posterity.

   Tho' many of my readers have at times observ'd and remark'd a Sort of
   antique Flow in my Stile of Writing, it hath pleased me to pass amongst
   the Members of this Generation as a young Man, giving out the Fiction
   that I was born in 1890, in America. I am now, however, resolv'd to
   unburthen myself of a Secret which I have hitherto kept thro' Dread of
   Incredulity; and to impart to the Publick a true knowledge of my long
   years, in order to gratifie their taste for authentick Information of
   an Age with whose famous Personages I was on familiar Terms. Be it then
   known that I was born on the family Estate in Devonshire, of the 10th
   day of August, 1690 (or in the new Gregorian Stile of Reckoning, the
   20th of August), being therefore now in my 228th year. Coming early to
   London, I saw as a Child many of the celebrated Men of King William's
   Reign, including the lamented Mr. Dryden, who sat much at the Tables of
   Will's Coffee-House. With Mr. Addison and Dr. Swift I later became very
   well acquainted, and was an even more familiar Friend to Mr. Pope, whom
   I knew and respected till the Day of his Death. But since it is of my
   more recent Associate, the late Dr. Johnson, that I am at this time
   desir'd to write; I will pass over my Youth for the present.

   I had first Knowledge of the Doctor in May of the year 1738, tho' I did
   not at that Time meet him. Mr. Pope had just compleated his Epilogue to
   his Satires (the Piece beginning: "Not twice a Twelvemonth you appear
   in Print."), and had arrang'd for its Publication. On the very Day it
   appear'd, there was also publish'd a Satire in Imitation of Juvenal,
   intitul'd "London", by the then unknown Johnson; and this so struck the
   Town, that many Gentlemen of Taste declared, it was the Work of a
   greater Poet than Mr. Pope. Notwithstanding what some Detractors have
   said of Mr. Pope's petty jealousy, he gave the Verses of his new Rival
   no small Praise; and having learnt thro' Mr. Richardson who the Poet
   was, told me, 'that Mr. Johnson wou'd soon be deterré'.

   I had no personal Acquaintance with the Doctor till 1763, when I was
   presented to him at the Mitre Tavern by Mr. James Boswell, a young
   Scotchman of excellent Family and great Learning, but small Wit, whose
   metrical Effusions I had sometimes revis'd.

   Dr. Johnson, as I beheld him, was a full, pursy Man, very ill drest,
   and of slovenly Aspect. I recall him to have worn a bushy Bob-Wig,
   untyed and without Powder, and much too small for his Head. His cloaths
   were of rusty brown, much wrinkled, and with more than one Button
   missing. His Face, too full to be handsom, was likewise marred by the
   Effects of some scrofulous Disorder; and his Head was continually
   rolling about in a sort of convulsive way. Of this Infirmity, indeed, I
   had known before; having heard of it from Mr. Pope, who took the
   Trouble to make particular Inquiries.

   Being nearly seventy-three, full nineteen Years older than Dr. Johnson
   (I say Doctor, tho' his Degree came not till two Years afterward), I
   naturally expected him to have some Regard for my Age; and was
   therefore not in that Fear of him, which others confess'd. On my asking
   him what he thought of my favourable Notice of his Dictionary in The
   Londoner, my periodical Paper, he said: Sir, I possess no Recollection
   of having perus'd your Paper, and have not a great Interest in the
   Opinions of the less thoughtful Part of Mankind." Being more than a
   little piqued at the Incivility of one whose Celebrity made me
   solicitous of his Approbation, I ventur'd to retaliate in kind, and
   told him, I was surpris'd that a Man of Sense shou'd judge the
   Thoughtfulness of one whose Productions he admitted never having read.
   "Why, Sir," reply'd Johnson, "I do not require to become familiar with
   a Man's Writings in order to estimate the Superficiality of his
   Attainments, when he plainly skews it by his Eagerness to mention his
   own Productions in the first Question he puts to me." Having thus
   become Friends, we convers'd on many Matters. When, to agree with him,
   I said I was distrustful of the Authenticity of Ossian's Poems, Mr.
   Johnson said: "That, Sir, does not do your Understanding particular
   Credit; for what all the Town is sensible of, is no great Discovery for
   a Grub-Street Critick to make. You might as well say, you have a strong
   Suspicion that Milton wrote Paradise Lost!"

   I thereafter saw Johnson very frequently, most often at Meetings of THE
   LITERARY CLUB, which was founded the next Year by the Doctor, together
   with Mr. Burke, the parliamentary Orator, Mr. Beauclerk, a Gentleman of
   Fashion, Mr. Langton, a pious Man and Captain of Militia, Sir J.
   Reynolds, the widely known Painter, Dr. Goldsmith, the prose and
   poetick Writer, Dr. Nugent, father-in-law to Mr. Burke, Sir John
   Hawkins, Mr. Anthony Charmier, and my self. We assembled generally at
   seven o'clock of an Evening, once a Week, at the Turk's-Head, in
   Gerrard-Street, Soho, till that Tavern was sold and made into a private
   Dwelling; after which Event we mov'd our Gatherings successively to
   Prince's in Sackville-Street, Le Tellier's in Dover-Street, and
   Parsloe's and The Thatched House in St. James's-Street. In these
   Meetings we preserv'd a remarkable Degree of Amity and Tranquillity,
   which contrasts very favourably with some of the Dissensions and
   Disruptions I observe in the literary and amateur Press Associations of
   today. This Tranquillity was the more remarkable, because we had
   amongst us Gentlemen of very opposed Opinions. Dr. Johnson and I, as
   well as many others, were high Tories; whilst Mr. Burke was a Whig, and
   against the American War, many of his Speeches on that Subject having
   been widely publish'd. The least congenial Member was one of the
   Founders, Sir John Hawkins, who hath since written many
   misrepresentations of our Society. Sir John, an eccentrick Fellow, once
   declin'd to pay his part of the Reckoning for Supper, because 'twas his
   Custom at Home to eat no Supper. Later he insulted Mr. Burke in so
   intolerable a Manner, that we all took Pains to shew our Disapproval;
   after which Incident he came no more to our Meetings. However, he never
   openly fell out with the Doctor, and was the Executor of his Will; tho'
   Mr. Boswell and others have Reason to question the genuineness of his
   Attachment. Other and later Members of the CLUB were Mr. David Garrick,
   the Actor and early Friend of Dr. Johnson, Messieurs Tho. and Jos.
   Warton, Dr. Adam Smith, Dr. Percy, Author of the Reliques, Mr. Edw.
   Gibbon, the Historian, Dr. Burney, the Musician, Mr. Malone, the
   Critick, and Mr. Boswell. Mr. Garrick obtain'd Admittance only with
   Difficulty; for the Doctor, notwithstanding his great Friendship, was
   for ever affecting to decry the Stage and all Things connected with it.
   Johnson, indeed, had a most singular Habit of speaking for Davy when
   others were against him, and of arguing against him, when others were
   for him. I have no Doubt that he sincerely lov'd Mr. Garrick, for he
   never alluded to him as he did to Foote, who was a very coarse Fellow
   despite his comick Genius. Mr. Gibbon was none too well lik'd, for he
   had an odious sneering Way which offended even those of us who most
   admir'd his historical Productions. Mr. Goldsmith, a little Man very
   vain of his Dress and very deficient in Brilliancy of Conversation, was
   my particular Favourite; since I was equally unable to shine in the
   Discourse. He was vastly jealous of Dr. Johnson, tho' none the less
   liking and respecting him. I remember that once a Foreigner, a German,
   I think, was in our Company; and that whilst Goldsmith was speaking, he
   observ'd the Doctor preparing to utter something. Unconsciously looking
   upon Goldsmith as a meer Encumbrance when compar'd to the greater Man,
   the Foreigner bluntly interrupted him and incurr'd his lasting
   Hostility by crying, "Hush, Toctor Shonson iss going to speak!"

   In this luminous Company I was tolerated more because of my Years than
   for my Wit or Learning; being no Match at all for the rest. My
   Friendship for the celebrated Monsieur Voltaire was ever a Cause of
   Annoyance to the Doctor; who was deeply orthodox, and who us'd to say
   of the French Philosopher: "Vir est acerrimi Ingenii et paucarum
   Literarum."

   Mr. Boswell, a little teazing Fellow whom I had known for some Time
   previously, us'd to make Sport of my aukward Manners and old-fashion'd
   Wig and Cloaths. Once coming in a little the worse for Wine (to which
   he was addicted) he endeavour'd to lampoon me by means of an Impromptu
   in verse, writ on the Surface of the Table; but lacking the Aid he
   usually had in his Composition, he made a bad grammatical Blunder. I
   told him, he shou'd not try to pasquinade the Source of his Poesy. At
   another Time Bozzy (as we us'd to call him) complain'd of my Harshness
   toward new Writers in the Articles I prepar'd for The Monthly Review.
   He said, I push'd every Aspirant off the Slopes of Parnassus. "Sir," I
   reply'd, "you are mistaken. They who lose their Hold do so from their
   own Want of Strength; but desiring to conceal their Weakness, they
   attribute the Absence of Success to the first Critick that mentions
   them." I am glad to recall that Dr. Johnson upheld me in this Matter.

   Dr. Johnson was second to no Man in the Pains he took to revise the bad
   Verses of others; indeed, 'tis said that in the book of poor blind old
   Mrs. Williams, there are scarce two lines which are not the Doctor's.
   At one Time Johnson recited to me some lines by a Servant to the Duke
   of Leeds, which had so amus'd him, that he had got them by Heart. They
   are on the Duke's Wedding, and so much resemble in Quality the Work of
   other and more recent poetick Dunces, that I cannot forbear copying
   them:

     "When the Duke of Leeds shall marry'd be
     To a fine young Lady of high Quality
     How happy will that Gentlewoman be
     In his Grace of Leeds' good Company."

   I ask'd the Doctor, if he had ever try'd making Sense of this Piece;
   and upon his saying he had not, I amus'd myself with the following
   Amendment of it:

     When Gallant LEEDS auspiciously shall wed
     The virtuous Fair, of antient Lineage bred,
     How must the Maid rejoice with conscious Pride
     To win so great an Husband to her Side!

   On shewing this to Dr. Johnson, he said, "Sir, you have straightened
   out the Feet, but you have put neither Wit nor Poetry into the Lines."

   It wou'd afford me Gratification to tell more of my Experiences with
   Dr. Johnson and his circle of Wits; but I am an old Man, and easily
   fatigued. I seem to ramble along without much Logick or Continuity when
   I endeavour to recall the Past; and fear I light upon but few Incidents
   which others have not before discuss'd. Shou'd my present Recollections
   meet with Favour, I might later set down some further Anecdotes of old
   Times of which I am the only Survivor. I recall many things of Sam
   Johnson and his Club, having kept up my Membership in the Latter long
   after the Doctor's Death, at which I sincerely mourn'd. I remember how
   John Burgoyne, Esq., the General, whose Dramatick and Poetical Works
   were printed after his Death, was blackballed by three Votes; probably
   because of his unfortunate Defeat in the American War, at Saratoga.
   Poor John! His Son fared better, I think, and was made a Baronet. But I
   am very tired. I am old, very old, and it is Time for my Afternoon Nap.

   Amazing Stories was an American science fiction magazine launched in
   April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the
   first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Before Amazing,
   science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other
   magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but Amazing helped
   define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.-- Excerpted from Amazing
   Stories on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

   An American to Mother England
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Published January 1916
   9362An American to Mother EnglandH. P. Lovecraft

   England! My England! can the surging sea
   That lies between us tear my heart from thee?
   Can distant birth and distant dwelling drain
   Th' ancestral blood that warms the loyal vein?
   Isle of my Fathers! hear the filial song
   Of him whose sources but to thee belong!
   World-Conquering Mother! by thy mighty hand
   Was carv'd from savage wilds my native land:
   Thy matchless sons the firm foundation laid;
   Thy matchless arts the nascent nation made:
   By thy just laws the young republic grew,
   And through thy greatness, kindred greatness knew.
   What man that springs from thy untainted line
   But sees Columbia's virtues all as thine?
   Whilst nameless multitudes upon our shore
   From the dim corners of creation pour,
   Whilst mongrel slaves crawl hither to partake
   Of Saxon liberty they could not make,
   From such an alien crew in grief I turn,
   And for the mother's voice of Britain burn.
   England! can aught remove the cherish'd chain
   That binds my spirit to thy blest domain?
   Can Revolution's bitter precepts sway
   The soul that must the ties of race obey?
   Create a new Columbia if ye will,
   The flesh that forms me is Britannic still!
   Hail! oaken shades, and meads of dewy green,
   So oft in sleep, yet ne'er in waking seen.
   Peal out, ye ancient chimes, from vine-clad tower
   Where pray'd my fathers in a vanish'd hour:
   What countless years of rev'rence can ye claim
   From bygone worshippers that bore my name!
   Their forms are crumbling in the vaults around,
   Whilst I, across the sea, but dream the sound.
   Return, Sweet Vision! Let me glimpse again
   The stone-built abbey, rising o'er the plain;
   The neighb'ring village with its sun-shower'd square;
   The shaded mill-stream, and the forest fair,
   The hedge-lin'd lane, that leads to rustic cot
   Where sweet contentment is the peasant's lot:
   The mystic grove, by Druid wraiths possess'd,
   The flow'ring fields, with fairy-castles blest:
   And the old manor-house, sedate and dark,
   Set in the shadows of the wooded park.
   Can this be dreaming? Must my eyelids close
   That I may catch the fragrance of the rose?
   Is it in fancy that the midnight vale
   Thrills with the warblings of the nightingale?
   A golden moon bewitching radiance yields,
   And England's fairies trip o'er England's fields.
   England! Old England! in my love for thee
   No dream is mine, but blessed memory;
   Such haunting images and hidden fires
   Course with the bounding blood of British sires:
   From British bodies, minds, and souls I come,
   And from them draw the vision of their home.
   Awake, Columbia! scorn the vulgar age
   That bids thee slight thy lordly heritage.
   Let not the wide Atlantic's wildest wave
   Burst the blest bonds that fav'ring Nature gave:
   Connecting surges `twixt the nations run,
   Our Saxon souls dissolving into one!

   <-"Andy" Lockhart
   An Appreciation
   by Howard Phillips Lovecraft
   Foreword->
   From At the Bars of Memory and Other Poems (1918) by Andrew Francis
   Lockhart.

   AN APPRECIATION

   In last Tuesday's issue of the American appeared "The Hunger" by Andrew
   Francis Lockhart, the poem considered by H. P. Lovecraft, a Boston
   critic, as equal to Riley's "An Old Sweetheart of Mine." Here is the
   critic's own opinion of Andy's poetry:

   To Mr. Lockhart, on His Poetry

   Whilst the town poet, dodd'ring in decay,
   With hopeless drivel drives the Muse away,
   Pleased with the clatt'ring of some formless line
   That only he can fathom or define;
   While sense and rhyme are banish'd as too hard
   Till ev'ry chimney-sweep can turn a bard;
   How great our joy to leave the free-verse throng.
   And ease our ears with Lockhart's moving song!
   Melodious Lockhart! Whose Aonian art
   Transmits the pulsing of the simple heart;
   Whose homely pen no languid soul dissects,
   Whose polished line no cultur'd fog reflects;
   From Grecian stores he bears no tinsel pelf,
   Content to be a classic in himself!
   Let feebler wits their cumbrous couplets weight
   With dry allusion--dullness' specious freight.
   Or deck with sounding words the empty length;
   Of stilted odes, to hide their want of strength;
   Our Milbank bard such formal trash disdains,
   And fresh from Nature draws his rural strains
   'Tis not for him in solitude to scan
   The pedant's page, and shun the haunts of man;
   'Tis not for him in books alone to trace
   The moods and passions of our mortal race;
   Close to mankind, his deft, experienced quill
   Portrays his fellows with familiar skill.
   No borrow'd sentiment or mimic rage
   Stalks coldly through our poet's glowing page:
   Fancy's true visions ev'ry line inspire,
   And fill each melody with genuine fire,
   Charm'd by the sound, the cynic stops to hear,
   And sheds against his will the human tear,
   What rising fame will future ages bring
   To Lockhart, master of the lyric string?
   With what fond honours will the minstrel move
   Amongst the Muses of the Sacred grove?
   Skill'd in sweet harmonies, supremely blest
   With all the genius of his Native West,
   His lofty brow deserves the laurel crown
   That none hath worn, since Riley laid it down!

   -- H. P. Lovecraft.

   1336993ArcadiaH.P. Lovecraft

   By Head Balledup
   O give me the life of the village,
         Uninhibited, free, and sweet;
   The place where the arts all flourish,
         Grove Court and Christopher Street.
   I am sick of the old conventions,
         And critics who will not praise,
   So sing ho for the open spaces,
         And aesthetes with kindly ways.
   Here every bard is a genius,
         And artists are Raphaels,
   And above the roofs of Patchin Place
         The Muse of Talent dwells.

   Astrophobos  (1917)

   Published c. 25 November 1917

   In the Midnight heaven's burning
   Through the ethereal deeps afar
   Once I watch'd with restless yearning
   An alluring aureate star;
   Ev'ry eve aloft returning
   Gleaming nigh the Arctic Car.
   Mystic waves of beauty blended
   With the gorgeous golden rays
   Phantasies of bliss descended
   In a myrrh'd Elysian haze.
   In the lyre-born chords extended
   Harmonies of Lydian lays.
   And (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,
   Where the free and blessed dwell,
   And each moment bears a treasure,
   Freighted with the lotos-spell,
   And there floats a liquid measure
   From the lute of Israfel.
   There (I told myself) were shining
   Worlds of happiness unknown,
   Peace and Innocence entwining
   By the Crowned Virtue's throne;
   Men of light, their thoughts refining
   Purer, fairer, than my own.
   Thus I mus'd when o'er the vision
   Crept a red delirious change;
   Hope dissolving to derision,
   Beauty to distortion strange;
   Hymnic chords in weird collision,
   Spectral sights in endless range....
   Crimson burn'd the star of madness
   As behind the beams I peer'd;
   All was woe that seem'd but gladness
   Ere my gaze with Truth was sear'd;
   Cacodaemons, mir'd with madness,
   Through the fever'd flick'ring leer'd....
   Now I know the fiendish fable
   Then the golden glitter bore;
   Now I shun the spangled sable
   That I watch'd and lov'd before;
   But the horror, set and stable,
   Haunts my soul forevermore!

   At the Root  (1918)
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Written 1918. Published in The United Amateur, 17, No. 6 (July 1918),
   111-12.
   9568At the RootH. P. Lovecraft1918

   To those who look beneath the surface, the present universal war drives
   home more than one anthropological truth in striking fashion; and of
   the verities none is more profound than that relating to the essential
   immutability of mankind and its instincts.

   Four years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under
   certain biological fallacies which may, in a sense, be held responsible
   for the extent and duration of the present conflict. These fallacies,
   which were the foundation of pacifism and other pernicious forms of
   social and political radicalism, dealt with the capacity of man to
   evolve mentally beyond his former state of subservience to primate
   instinct and pugnacity, and to conduct his affairs and international or
   interracial relations on a basis of reason and good-will. That belief
   in such capability is unscientific and childishly naive, is beside the
   question. The fact remains, that the most civilised part of the world,
   including our own Anglo-Saxondom, did entertain enough of these notions
   to relax military vigilance, lay stress on points of honour, place
   trust in treaties, and permit a powerful and unscrupulous nation to
   indulge unchecked and unsuspected in nearly fifty years of preparation
   for world-wide robbery and slaughter. We are reaping the result of our
   simplicity.

   The past is over. Our former follies we can but regret, and expiate as
   best we may by a crusade to the death against the Trans-Rhenane monster
   which we allowed to grow and flourish beneath our very eyes. But the
   future holds more of responsibility, and we must prepare to guard
   against any renascence of the benevolent delusions that four years of
   blood have barely been able to discard forever the sentimental
   standpoint, and to view our species through the cold eyes of science
   alone. We must recognise the essential underlaying savagery in the
   animal called man, and return to older and sounder principles of
   national life and defense. We must realise that man's nature will
   remain the same so long as he remains man; that civilisation is but a
   slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast sleeps lightly and
   ever ready to awake. To preserve civilisation, we must deal
   scientifically with the brute element, using only genuine biological
   principles. In considering ourselves, we think too much of ethics and
   sociology - too little of plain natural history. We should perceive
   that man's period of historical existence, a period so short that his
   physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest degree, is
   insufficient to allow of any considerable mental change. The instincts
   that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians of old, govern us as
   well; and as the ancients thought, grasped, struggled, and deceived, so
   shall we moderns continue to think, grasp, struggle, and deceive in our
   inmost hearts. Change is only superficial and apparent.

   Man's respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental
   constitution and environment. Through certain modes of thought and
   training it can be elevated tremendously, yet there is always a limit.
   The man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths the
   restraints imposed by conventions and honour, but beyond a certain
   point primitive will or desire cannot be curbed. Denied anything
   ardently desired, the individual or state will argue and parley just so
   long - then, if the impelling motive be sufficiently great, will cast
   aside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition, plunging
   viciously after the object wished; all the more fantastically savage
   because of previous repression. The sole ultimate factor in human
   decisions is physical force. This we must learn, however repugnant the
   idea may seem, if we are to protect ourselves and our institutions.
   Reliance on anything else is fallacious and ruinous. Dangerous beyond
   description are the voices sometimes heard today, decrying the
   continuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities.

   The specific application of the scientific truth regarding man's native
   instincts will be found in the adoption of a post-bellum international
   programme. Obviously, we must take into account the primordial
   substructure and arrange for the upholding of culture by methods which
   will stand the acid test of stress and conflicting ambitions. In
   disillusioned diplomacy, ample armament, and universal military
   training alone will be found the solution of the world's difficulties.
   It will not be a perfect solution, because humanity is not perfect. It
   will not abolish war, because war is the expression of a natural human
   tendency. But it will at least produce an approximate stability of
   social and political conditions, and prevent the menace of the entire
   world by the greed of any one of its constituent parts.

   Some or all works by this author are in the public domain in the United
   States because they were published before January 1, 1923. They may be
   copyrighted outside the U.S. (see Help:Public domain). However, works
   published before 1923 may be in the public domain in countries where
   they would ordinarily be copyrighted (due to the term of 70 years [or
   less] after the author's death having not yet expired) but whose
   legislature has waived copyright by accepting the rule of the shorter
   term.

          For Class A renewals records (books only) published between 1923
          and 1963, check the Stanford University Copyright Renewal
          Database.

          records.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is imperative that contributors search the renewal databases and
   ascertain that there is no evidence of a copyright renewal before using
   this license. Failure to do so will result in the deletion of the work
   as a copyright violation. The author died in 1946, so works by this

About Lovecraft[edit]

     * "To Howard Phillips Lovecraft," by George Henry Weiss in Weird
       Tales (March 1938, vol. 31, no. 3)
     * H. P. Lovecraft: A Bibliography by Joseph Payne Brennan (1952)
     * H. P. Lovecraft, An Evaluation by Joseph Payne Brennan (1955)

Copyrights[edit]

     * For The Call of Cthulhu, the relevant records are in the years
       1953, 1954 and 1955.

     * According to S.T. Joshi's "H.P. Lovecraft: A Life" (pp. 640-641):
       Much of Lovecraft's work is in the public domain. This is
       unquestionably so in terms of the tales, essays, and poems
       published in the amateur press. As for stories published in "Weird
       Tales", the six that the magazine owned outright should have had
       their copyrights renewed after twenty-eight years, but repeated
       searches in the Library of Congress have turned up no renewals of
       any kind. Of the stories Lovecraft himself controlled, by law only
       he, his heirs, or his executor could have renewed the rights, but
       this was never done.

     * Chris Karr has reviewed these documents and has published a report
       of his findings at
       http://www.aetherial.net/personal/files/lovecraft_renewals.pdf . In
       short, there are no copyright records that reference any of
       Lovecraft's original stories (only the Arkham House compilations),
       but the copyrights to "Weird Tales" were renewed properly, and
       works published prior to 1926 (when Lovecraft is thought to have
       sold full rights to "Weird Tales") in that magazine may be subject
       to protection IF they were published in "Weird Tales" for the first
       time. Joshi identifies thirteen works and believes that seven of
       those thirteen had been published elsewhere previously.

Author talk:Howard Phillips Lovecraft

   From Wikisource
   Jump to: navigation, search
   PD-icon.svg The copyright of some works by this author were assigned by
   the author to another party, and that assignee renewed the copyright at
   the appropriate time, in the assignee's own name, after the death of
   the author. However, some works by this author are in the public domain
   in the United States because the renewal copyrights were never vested
   in the assignees who made the copyright renewal application. The author
   must be alive at the start of the copyright renewal term for the
   author's prior assignments to vest. If, however, the author dies before
   vesting of the renewal copyright, the party to whom the
   renewal-copyright interest was conveyed loses the entitlement to that
   interest. Therefore, some copyright renewals were not valid.

Public Domain[edit]

   I'm quite interested to know how the works of H.P. Lovecraft came to be
   in Wikibooks: can I now assume some of his works, including The Call of
   Cthulhu are now in the public domain? If so, I'd be interested to know
   why they are now in the public domain and what were the original
   sources for the works included here? --Axon 14:24, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

          A source for publication information for Lovecraft's stories is
          http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/. I would also
          recommend examining the links listed on the article page
          concerning S. T. Joshi's research. I examined the project
          Gutenberg compilations of copyright renewal information and
          could find no references to Lovecraft at all in the records from
          1953 to 1967. Although there were a number of renewals by August
          Derleth, all were for Mr. Derleth's own work. There were no
          renewal notices whatsoever for Donald Wandrei. If any other
          supposed copyright holders make themselves known their claims
          could be examined but until then I think it is reasonable to
          assume that the copyrights on Mr. Lovecraft's works have
          expired. -- CSN 02:23, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

          I've just contributed transcripts of my copies of the wills of
          Lovecraft, his aunt Gamwell, and a copy of the letter from
          Morris and Lewis to Arkham House, more commonly known the
          "Morrish-Lewis gift". If I can be of further assistance, contact
          me at lovecraft@aetherial.net. -- Chris Karr --unsigned comment
          by 68.72.135.94 (talk) 13:20, 7 August 2006.

Spliting Works Section[edit]

   The works section was originally split into Cthulhu Mythos novels and
   other novels. Someone changed Cthulhu to Arkham since not all the
   novels refered to Cthulhu but they were all generally set in the Arkham
   area. I think the best solution is to combine all his works into one
   section. The wikipedia article breaks his work down into Macabre,
   Dream-Cycle, and Cthulhu Mythos but has only rough dates as a
   guideline. [1] puts 12 works in the Cthulhu Mythos period but again,
   not all of those works are about Cthulhu related things. --CSN 22:21, 8
   September 2005 (UTC)

Cthulhu Mythos/Dream Cycle/Macabre[edit]

   Shouldn't the stories be separated into these three categories?

          I believe not everybody agrees with these separations. Lovecraft
          himself never mentioned them.

Novels and Short Stories in Chronological Order[edit]

   I don't know about the rest of you, but I usually prefer reading an
   author's works in the order that they were written. For that reason,
   I'm including the novels and short stories section (the one that
   interests me the most) here below in chronological writing order, more
   or less (publication if that's all there is). It would probably just
   waste space to put this on the author page, but maybe we could make a
   subpage for chronologically ordered lists (each type (poetry, novels
   and short stories, etc.) in separate sections and one all together),
   don't you think? --Cromwellt|talk|contribs 03:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

Delete Article The Road To Madness[edit]

   The reference to this article has been removed from this page as the
   article itself is pending deletion due to being a duplicate of the
   article Cool Air already available on wikisource. --unsigned comment by

Sweet Ermengarde[edit]

   This is currently listed as an essay, but I think it is actually a
   short story. It is listed as such on wikipedia. --unsigned comment by

Additional Works Already in Wikisource to Add to List[edit]

   For example, there is The Horror in the Museum, already in WikiSource.
   I notice that The Mound is available on the web. Is it public domain
   now? (This note should be deleted if these additions are made.)

The Mound[edit]

   "The Mound" was published in the same book as The Curse of Yig and
   Medusa's Coil. If those two are public domain, surely "The Mound" is as
   well?

                Witches Hollow was first published in Dark Mind, Dark

   These only include renewals for works 1923-1948, probably 1949 and
   possibly 1950. Anything first printed between 1950-1963 would need a
   renewal that can be checked at [3] and anything first published
   1964-2002 is still in copyright. I don't believe this covers any
   fiction, but it covers some poetry and probably most of his
   letters.--Prosfilaes (talk) 01:58, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

          I don't understand, Prosfilaes; are you saying the renewals
          listed above and those found at copyright.gov wouldn't cover any
          of Lovecraft's fiction? Because the third renewal paragraph
          above clearly refers to stories. ResScholar (talk) 04:45, 26
          August 2010 (UTC)

                Yes. "Best Supernatural Stories" would cover the volume as
                printed, the editing, the compilation. But none of the
                stories were first published in there, so while we can't
                used the editions of the stories there published, the
                stories themselves are just fine.--Prosfilaes (talk)

C.M. Eddy, Jr[edit]

   I don't really like moving this to an Attributed section. It's clear
   that HPL did have influence on them; no one is denying that. I don't
   know what exactly was done, but these are not "attributed to"; they are
   "HPL is given credit as a collaborator for the work he did on them",
   even if they only amounted to a couple sentences. ([4] mentions
   specifically some of these changes at the bottom of the comments.) The
   fine distinctions about what work he did on them belong on the work
   page, IMO.--Prosfilaes (talk) 01:45, 25 March 2012 (UTC)

          Yes, apparently even an attributed section isn't enough, and
          wasn't quite right anyway. Putting everything in one section is
          the only sensible solution. However, that isn't going to stop
          the reversions. I've added a sentence to try to mitigate that
          but there's chance the user doing this won't even read it. -

   When age fell upon the world, and wonder went out of the minds of men;
   when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly, in
   whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of Spring's flowering
   meads; when learning stripped the Earth of her mantle of beauty and
   poets sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and
   inward looking eyes; when these things had come to pass, and childish
   hopes had gone forever, there was a man who traveled out of life on a
   quest into spaces whither the world's dreams had fled.

   Of the name and abode of this man little is written, for they were of
   the waking world only; yet it is said that both were obscure. It is
   enough to say that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile
   twilight reigned, that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil,
   coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not to open
   fields and groves but on to a dim court where other windows stared in
   dull despair. From that casement one might see only walls and windows,
   except sometimes when one leaned so far out and peered at the small
   stars that passed. And because mere walls and windows must soon drive a
   man to madness who dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used
   night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment
   of things beyond the waking world and the tall cities. After years he
   began to call the slow sailing stars by name, and to follow them in
   fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his
   vision opened to many secret vistas whose existance no common eye
   suspected. And one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream
   haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher's window to merge with
   the close air of his room and to make him a part of their fabulous
   wonder.

   There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with
   dust of gold, vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate
   spaces and heavy perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured
   there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their
   whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable depths.
   Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away
   without touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window;
   and for days not counted in men's calendars the tides of far spheres
   that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly
   left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore, a green shore fragrant with
   lotus blossoms and starred by red camalates...

   POWERS MEREDITH, at his shower-bath before dinner in the bathroom
   adjoining his room in his New York City club, allowed the cake of soap
   to drop on the tiled floor. Stooping to recover it he rapped the side
   of his head against the marble sidewall. The resulting bruise was
   painful, and almost at once puffed up into a noticeable lump ....

   Meredith dined in the grill that evening. Having no after-dinner
   engagement he went into the quiet library of the club, empty at this
   hour, and settled himself with a new book beside a softly-shaded
   reading lamp.

   From time to time a slight, inadvertent pressure of his head against
   the chair's leather upholstered back would remind him unpleasantly of
   his accident in the shower-bath. This, after it happened several times,
   became an annoyance, and Meredith shifted himself into a preventive
   attitude with his legs draped over one of the chair's rounded arms.

   No one else came into the library. Faint, clicking noises came in from
   the nearby billiard-room where .a couple of men were playing, but,
   absorbed in his book, he did not notice these. The only perceptible
   sound was that of the gentle, steady rain outside. This, in the form of
   a soothing, continuous murmur, came through the partly--opened, high
   windows. He read on.

   Precisely as he turned over the ninety-sixth page of his book, he heard
   a dull sound, like a very large explosion coming from a vast distance.

   Alert now, his finger, holding his place in the book, he listened. Then
   he heard a rumbling roar, as though countless tons of wrecked masonry
   were falling; falling; clearly, unmistakably, the remote thunder of
   some catastrophic ruin. He dropped his book, and, obeying an almost
   automatic impulse, started for the door.

   HE met nobody as he rushed down the stairs. At the coatroom, which he
   had to pass on his way to the doorway, two fellow members were chatting
   easily as they took their checks. Meredith glanced at them, surprised.
   He rushed on, to the doorway, and out into the street, where he paused.
   An empty street!

   The rain, reduced now to a mere drizzle, made the asphalt shimmer in
   the street lights. Over towards Broadway, certainly, there must be
   clamor! But when he reached it he found only the compound eleven
   o'clock bedlam of Times Square.

   Along Sixth Avenue, countless taxi-cabs weaved in a many--hued stream,
   jockeying for position in the maëlström of the night-traffic about the
   Hippodrome. On the corner, a solitary rubber-coated policeman, swung
   long efficient arms like a pair of mechanical semaphores, and
   skillfully directed the crawling traffic. To his ever-increasing
   wonderment, everything seemed normal. But what then had been that
   catastrophic sound?

   RETURNING to the club entrance, he hesitated, a frown creasing his
   brow. He mounted the three steps hesitatingly, and entered, pausing at
   the door-man's desk. `

   "Send me up an `extra,' please, if one comes out," he told the clerk.
   Then he went up to his bedroom completely puzzled.

   Half an hour later as he lay in bed wakeful and trying to compose in
   his thoughts the varying, incongruous aspect of this strange affair, he
   was all at once acutely conscious of a distant, thin, confused, roaring
   hum. The most prominent element in this sound was the deep, soft, and
   insistently penetrating blending of countless voices. Through it ran a
   kind of dominant note--a note of horror. The sound chilled his blood.
   It was eerie. He found himself holding his breath as he listened,
   straining every faculty to take in that faint, distant, terrible clamor
   of fear and despair.

   Of just when he fell asleep he had no recollection, but when he
   awakened the next morning there hung over his mind a shadow of
   remembered horror, not wholly dissipated until he had bathed and begun
   to dress. He heard none of the sounds at the time of his awakening.

   No "extra" lay outside his bedroom door, and a little later at
   breakfast he opened expectantly and scanned several newspapers vainly
   and with a mounting sense of wonderment for any account of a
   catastrophe which could have caused the sounds. Gradually the
   implication grew upon him. He had, actually, heard the convincing,
   unmistakable evidence of such a catastrophe--and no one else knew
   anything about it!

   He fell asleep immediately after turning in.

   The following morning was Sunday. The reading--room was full, and he
   carried his book up to his bed-room after late breakfast to read the
   rest of it in peace. Soon after he became immersed in it, his attention
   was distracted by the tapping of a window-shade, blown in and out by
   the breeze. It was annoying and he paused in his reading, intending to
   rise and adjust the shade.

   As he withdrew his eyes, and part of his attention, from his book, all
   at once he heard a new sound. It was precisely as though a distant,
   sound-proof door had been abruptly opened.

   As he listened, fascinated, there came back to him and grew upon him a
   paralyzing, cold fear. There seemed to be no stopping it. The faint
   penumbra of a slight nausea shook him. He could distinguish overtones
   now, high tones, cries of battle; the impact of a charge against a
   resistant horde; noise of plied weapons.

   THE window-shade tapped again against the window casing. He snapped
   back into the familiar environment of his bedroom. He felt a little
   sick and weak. He rose shakily, walked across the room and into the
   bathroom, and, noisily splashing the water about, washed his hands and
   face.

   Then he paused, suddenly to listen again, a towel gripped between
   clenched hands. But he could hear nothing now, nothing except the
   tapping of that window-shade in the fresh breeze blowing through the
   open window. He hung the towel on its porcelain rod and walked back to
   his chair.

   It was an hour too early for lunch, but he wanted urgently to be where
   there were people about, even waiters, people who were not "hearing
   things!"

   In order to prolong his companionship with old Cavanagh, the only other
   early luncher, Meredith ate somewhat more than usual. The unaccustomed
   heavy meal at such an hour made him drowsy, and after lunch he
   stretched out on a davenport before one of the two open fireplaces in
   the now unoccupied reading-room, and fell at once into an uneasy sleep.

   A little before three he awakened, stale, and as he came to conscious
   wakefulness he began to hear, at first quite distinctly, and then with
   increasing loudness and clarity as-though a steady hand were opening'
   up a loudspeaker, that same sound of fire and human conflict, and the
   dreadful, menacing roar of a thunderous ocean's incalculable anger.

   Then, Old Cavanagh, napping on the other davenport, struggled with
   senile deliberation to his feet with many accompanying "hums" and
   "ha's," and began lumbering across the room towards him.

   "Lords' sake, what's the matter?" he demanded.

   Kindly goodwill looked out of the old man's distorted countenance.
   Meredith, unable to control himself any longer, stammered out his
   incredible story.

   "Hm! Strange . . ." was the old man's comment when Meredith ended. He
   produced, lighted deliberately, and puffed upon an enormous cigar. He
   seemed to cogitate as the two sat side by side in a pregnant silence of
   many minutes. At last he spoke.

   "You're upset, my boy, naturally. But, you can hear everything that's
   going on around you, can't you? Your actual hearing's all right, then.
   Hm! This other `hearing' starts up and goes on only when everything's
   perfectly quiet. First time, you were here reading; second time, in
   bed; third time, reading again; this time--if I wasn't snoring--you
   were in perfect quiet once more. Let's test that out, now. Keep
   perfectly still, and I'll do the same. Let's see if you hear anything."

   They fell silent once more, and for a while Meredith could hear nothing
   of the strange sounds. Then, as the silence deepened, once again came
   that complex of sounds indicating devastating battle, murder, and
   sudden death.

   He nodded silently at Cavanagh, and at the old man's acquiescent murmur
   the sounds ceased abruptly.

   IT TOOK urging before Meredith could be persuaded to consult an aurist.
   Medical men, Cavanagh reminded him, would keep quiet about anything
   strange or embarrassing. Professional ethics....

   They went uptown together that afternoon to Dr. Gatefield, a noted
   specialist. The doctor heard the story with close-lipped, professional
   attention. Then he tested Meredith's hearing with various delicate
   instruments. Finally he gave an opinion.

   "We are familiar with various `ear-noises' Mr. Meredith. In some cases
   the location of one of the arteries too close to the ear-drum gives
   `roaring' noises. There are others, similar. I have eliminated
   everything of that kind. Your physical organism is in excellent
   condition, and unusually acute. There is nothing wrong with your
   hearing. This is a case for a psychiatrist.

   "I am not suggesting anything like mental derangement, you will please
   understand! But I recommend Dr. Cowlington. This seems to be a clear
   case of what is sometimes called `clairaudience,' or something
   similar--his department-; not mine. The aural equivalent of
   `clairvoyance' is what I am indicating, you see what I mean.
   `Second-sight' has to do with the eyes, of course, but it is mental,
   although there is often some physical background, I have no knowledge
   of those phenomena. I hope you will take my advice and allow Dr.
   Cowling--"

   "All right!" interrupted Meredith. "Where does he live? I might as well
   go through with the thing now as later."

   Dr. Gatefield showed traces of sympathy under his rather frosty
   professional exterior. He dropped the diagnostician, became the
   obliging, courteous gentleman. He telephoned to his colleague, the
   psychiatrist, and then surprised both Meredith and Cavanagh by
   accompanying them to Dr. Cowlington's. The psychiatrist proved to be a
   tall, thin, and rather kindly person, with heavy, complex spectacles on
   a prominent nose, and then, sand-colored wisps of hair in a
   complication of cowlicks. He showed marked interest in the case from
   the start. After hearing Meredith's story and the aurist's report he
   subjected Meredith to an examination of more than an hour, from which,
   feeling more or less as though he had been dissected, he nevertheless
   derived a considerable sense of relief.

   It was decided that Meredith should arrange at once to take several
   days off, come to Dr. Cowlington's house, and remain "under
   observation."

   HE ARRIVED at the doctor's the next morning and was given a pleasant,
   upstairs room, with many books and a comfortable davenport on which, in
   a recumbent position, the psychiatrist suggested, he should spend most
   of his waking hours, reading.

   During Monday and Tuesday, Meredith, now after Dr. Cowlington's
   skillful reassurances no longer upset at hearing the strange sounds,
   listened carefully for whatever might reach him from what seemed like
   another--and very restless--world! He heard as he listened for long
   periods uninterrupted by any aural distractions, the drama of a great
   community in the paralyzing grip of fear--fighting for its corporate
   life--against irresistible, impending, dreadful doom.

   He began, about this time, at Dr. Cowlington's suggestion, to write
   down some of the syllabification of the cries and shouts as well as he
   could manage it, on a purely phonetic basis. The sounds corresponded to
   no language known to him. The words and phrases were blurred and marred
   by the continuous uproar of the fury of waters. This was invariably,
   and continued to be, the sustained, distinctive background for every
   sound he heard during the periods while he remained passive and quiet.
   The various words and phrases were entirely unintelligible. His notes
   looked like nothing which either he or Cowlington could relate to any
   modern or ancient tongue. When read aloud they made nothing but
   gibberish.

   These strange terms were studied over very carefully by Dr. Cowlington,
   by Meredith himself, and by no less than three professors, of
   Archeology and Comparative Philology, one of whom, the Archeologist,
   was a friend of Cowlington's and the other two called in by him. All of
   these experts on ancient and obsolete languages listened with the
   greatest courtesy to Meredith's attempt to explain the apparent setting
   of the sounds--most of them were in the nature of battle--cries and
   what Meredith took to be fragments of desperately uttered prayer--some
   of the material having come to him in the form of uncouth, raucous
   howls--and with the greatest interest to his attempts at reproducing
   them orally. They studied his written notes with the most meticulous
   care. The verdict was unanimous, even emphatic on the part of the
   younger and more dogmatic philologist. These sounds were quite utterly
   at variance with any known speech, including Sanskrit, Indo-Iranian,
   and even the conjectural Akkadian and Sumerian spoken tongues. The
   transcribed syllables corresponded to nothing in any known language,
   ancient or modern. Emphatically they were not Japanese.

   The three professors took their departure, and Meredith and the
   psychiatrist Dr. Cowlington went over the list again.

   Meredith had written: "I, I, I, I;--R'ly-eh!--Ieh nya, --Ieh nya;
   --zoh, zoh-an-nuh!" There was only one grouping of the words which
   formed anything like a section of continuous speech, or sentence, and
   which Meredith had been able to capture more or less intact and write
   down--"Ióth, Ióth,--natcal-o, do yan kho thútthut."

   There were many other cries and, as he believed, desperately uttered
   prayers quite as strange and off the beaten tracks of recognized human
   speech as those noted down.

   IT WAS quite possibly because of his concentration on this affair of
   the remembered words-his own interest in them being naturally enhanced
   by Dr. Cowlington's and that of the three experts--that Meredith's
   dream-state impressions just at this time, and suddenly, became
   markedly acute. These dreams had been continuous and consecutive since
   their beginning several nights before, but on this night after the
   rather elaborate investigation of the words and syllables, Meredith
   began in earnest to get the affair of his environment in the strange
   city of the flames and conflicts and confusion and of a roaring ocean,
   cleared up with a startling abruptness. His dream impression that night
   was so utterly vivid; so acutely identical with the terms of the waking
   state; that he couldn't tell the difference between his dream slumber
   and wakeful consciousness!

   Everything that he had derived mentally out of that night's sleep was
   clearly and definitely present in his mind. It seemed to him precisely
   as though he had not been asleep; that he had not emerged from an
   ordinary night's rest into the accustomed circumstances of an early
   morning's awakening. It was, rather, as though he had very abruptly
   passed out of one quite definite life into another; as though, as it
   came to him afterwards, he had walked out of a theatre into the wholly
   unrelated after-theatre life of Times Square.

   One of the radical phases of this situation was not only that the
   succession of dream experiences had been continuous, with
   time--allowances for the intervening periods of those days-in-between
   which he had spent here in Dr. Cowlington's quiet house; not only that,
   extraordinary as this realization seemed to him. The nearly consecutive
   dream experiences had been the events of the past few days in a life of
   thirty-two years, spent in that same environment and civilization of
   which the cataclysmic conditions which he had been envisaging appeared
   to presage a direful end.

   HE WAS, to set out plainly what he had brought out of that last night's
   dream-experience, one Bothon, general of the military forces of the
   great district of Ludekta, the south-westerly provincial division of
   the continent of Atlantis, which had been colonized, as every Atlantean
   school child was well aware, some eighteen hundred years before by a
   series of emigrations from the mother continent. The Naacal
   language--with minor variations not unlike the differences between
   American speech and "English English"--was the common language of both
   continents.

   From his native Ludekta the General Bothon had made several voyages to
   the mother land. The first of these had been to Ghua, the central
   eastern province, a kind of grand tour made just after his finishing,
   at the age of twenty-two, his professional course in the Ludekta
   College of Military Training. He was thus familiar by experience, as
   were many other cultivated Atlanteans of the upper classes, with the
   very highly developed civilization of the mother continent. These
   cultural contacts had been aided by his second visit, and further
   enhanced not long before the present period of the dream-experiences
   when, at the age of thirty-one, Bothon, already of the rank of general,
   had been sent out as Ambassador to Aglad-Dho, joint capital of the
   confederated south-eastern provinces of Yish, Knan, and Buathon, one of
   the most strategic diplomatic posts, and the second most important
   provincial confederation of the mother continent.

   He had served in his ambassadorial capacity for only four months, and
   then had been abruptly recalled without explanation, but, as he had
   soon discovered upon his arrival home, because of the privately
   communicated request of the Emperor himself. His diplomatic superiors
   at home offered him no censure. Such Imperial requests were not
   unknown. These gentlemen were, actually, quite unaware of the reasons
   behind the Imperial request. No explanations had been given them, but
   there had been no Imperial censure of any kind.

   But the General, Bothon, knew the reasons very well, although he kept
   them strictly to himself. There was, indeed, only one reason, as he was
   acutely and very well aware.

   The requirements of his office had taken him rather frequently to Alu,
   the continental capital, metropolis of the civilized world.

   Here in the great city of Alu were assembled from all known parts of
   the terrestrial globe the world's diplomats, artists, philosophers,
   traders and shipmasters. Here in the great warehouses of solid stone
   and along the innumerable wharves were piled the world's goods--fabrics
   and perfumes; strange animals for the delectation of the untraveled
   curious. Here in the endless stalls and markets were dyed stuffs and
   silks; tubas and cymbals and musical rattles and lyres; choice woods
   and implements for the toilet--strigils, and curiously carved
   hand-fitting little blocks of soapstone, and oils innumerable for the
   freshening of beards and the anointing of bodies. Here were tunics and
   sandals and belts and thongs of soft-tanned, variously perfumed
   leathers. Here were displayed carved and cunningly wrought pieces of
   household furniture--glowing, burnished wall-mirrors of copper and tin
   and steel, bedsteads of an infinite range and design, cushions of
   swans' feathers, tables of plain and polished artizanship and of
   intarsia with metal scrolls set flush to their levels; marquetry work
   of contrasting woods-chairs and stools and cupboards and chests and
   foot-rests. Here were ornaments innumerable--fire--screens, and
   spindles for parchment-rolls, and tongs, and shades for lamps made of
   the scraped skins of animals; metal lamps of every design, and
   vegetable oils for the lamps in earthenware jars of many sizes and
   shapes. Here were foods and wines and dried fruits, and honey of many
   flavors; grains and dried meats and loaves of barley and wheat-meal
   past computation. Here in the great street of the armorers were maces
   and axes and swords and daggers of all the world's varieties and
   designs; armor of plate and chain-hauberks, and greaves and bassinets,
   and shelves with rows and rows of the heavy plate and helmets
   standardized for the use of such fighting men as Bothon himself
   commanded in their thousands.

   HERE were to be seen and examined costly canopies and the elaborate
   litters in which the slaves of the rich carried their masters through
   the narrow streets and broad, airy avenues of Alu. Rugs there were in
   an endless profusion of size and shape and design; rugs from distant
   Lemuria and from Atlantis and from tropical Antillea, and from the
   mountainous interior regions of the mother continent itself, where
   thousands of cunning weavers of fabrics worked at their looms; ordinary
   rugs of pressed felt, and gorgeous glowing rugs of silk from the
   southern regions where the mulberry trees grew; rugs, too, and thin,
   soft draperies of complex patterns made of the wool of lambs and of the
   long, silk-like hair of the mountain sheep.

   Here in Alu, center of the world's culture, were philosophers with
   their groups of disciples, small or great, propounding their systems on
   the corners of streets and in the public squares, wrangling incessantly
   over the end of man, and the greatest good, and the origin of material
   things. Here were vast libraries containing the essence of all that had
   been written down concerning science and religion and engineering and
   the innumerable fine arts, of the civilization of forty thousand years.
   Here were the temples of religion where the hierarchs propounded the
   principles of life, colleges of priests studying incessantly more and
   more deeply into the mysteries of the four principles; teaching the
   people the endless applications of these esoteric affairs to their
   conduct and daily lives.

   Into this fascinating treasure house of a great civilization the
   ambassador Bothon had penetrated as often as possible. The excellence
   of his family background, his own character and personal qualities, and
   his official position, all combined to make him a welcome guest in the
   mansions of the members of the emperor's court and of the highest
   stratum of social life in Alu.

   An impressionable young man, most of whose life previous to his
   appointment as ambassador had been spent in hard training for his
   military duties and in the rigorous prosecution of these as he rose
   rapidly grade by grade by hard man's work in camp and field during his
   many campaigns in the standing army of Ludekta, the general, Bothon,
   revelled in these many high social contacts. Very soon he found within
   himself and growing apace, the strong and indeed natural desire for a
   type of life to which his backgrounds and achievements had amply
   entitled him, but of which he had been, so far, deprived because of the
   well--nigh incessant demands upon him of his almost continuous military
   service.

   In short, the ambassador from Ludekta very greatly came to desire
   marriage, with some lady of his own caste and, preferably, of this
   metropolitan city of Alu with its sophistication and wide culture; a
   lady who might preside graciously over his ambassadorial establishment;
   who, when his term of office was concluded, would return with him to
   his native Ludekta in Atlantis, there permanently to grace the fine
   residence he had in his mind's eye when, a little later, he should
   retire from the Ludektan army and settle down as a senator into the
   type of life which he envisaged for his middle years.

   HE HAD been both fortunate and unfortunate in his actual falling in
   love. The lady, who reciprocated his ardent advances, was the Netvissa
   Ledda, daughter of the Netvis Toldon who was the emperor's brother. The
   fortunate aspect of this intense and sudden love affair which set all
   social Alu to commenting upon it, was the altogether human one of a
   virtually perfect compatability between the two. Their initial mutual
   attraction had become a settled regard for each other almost overnight.
   Within a few days thereafter they were very deeply in love. Humanly
   considered, the affair was perfection itself. Every circumstance save
   one, and that a merely artificial side of the case, gave promise of an
   ideal union.

   The single difficulty in the way of this marriage was, however, most
   unfortunately, an insuperable one. The Netvissa Ledda, niece of the
   emperor, belonged of right to the very highest social caste of the
   empire. The rank and degree of Netvis lay next to Royalty itself and in
   the case of the family of the Netvis Toldon partook of royalty. Against
   this fact basic in the structure of the empire's long-established
   custom, the Ambassador, General Bothon of Ludekta--although a gentleman
   of the very highest attainments, character, and worth, whose family
   record reached back a thousand years into the dim past before the
   colonization of Atlantis, whose reputation was second to none in the
   empire---the General, Bothon, was a commoner. As such, according to the
   rigid system prevalent at the court in Alu, capital of the Empire, he
   was hopelessly ineligible. The marriage was simply out of the question.

   The Emperor being called upon to settle this awkward affair, acted
   summarily, quite in the spirit of one who destroys a hopelessly wounded
   and suffering creature as an act of mercy. The Emperor took the one
   course open to him under these circumstances, and the General, Bothon,
   without any choice being open to him save submission to an Imperial
   request which had the force of law, took ship for Ludekta, leaving
   behind him in Alu the highest and dearest hope of his life, irreparably
   shattered.

   For the subsequent conduct of the General Bothon, recently Ludektan
   Ambassador to Aglad-Dho, there were three very definite contributing
   reasons. Of these the first and most prominent was the depth and
   intensity and genuineness of his love for the Netvissa Ledda. Beyond
   all possible things, he wanted her; and the proud soul of Bothon was
   very grievously racked and torn at the sudden unexpected and arbitrary
   separation from her which the Imperial request had brought about.

   The voyage from Aglad-Dho to Ludetka, across two sections of the
   globe's great oceans and through the ship canals and lakes which
   bisected the southern continent of the western hemisphere, occupied
   seven weeks. During this period of enforced inaction the bitter chagrin
   and deep disappointment of Bothon crystallized itself by means of the
   sustained reflection inevitable under the circumstances. General Bothon
   arrived in Ludekta in a state of mind which made him ready for
   anything, provided only it was action. This state of mind was the
   second of these contributory factors. The third was the immediate
   satisfaction of his desire for activity. During the course of his
   voyage home the ghoulish and, indeed, sub-human factory slaves, the
   shockingly Simian Gyaa-Hau, had inaugurated a revolt. This had spread,
   by the time of Bothon's arrival, throughout the entire province of
   Ludekta. The state sorely needed the efficient services of this, the
   youngest and most brilliant of its generals, and his reception on
   landing was more nearly that of a savior of his country than what a
   virtually disgraced diplomat might expect.

   INTO this campaign, which he prosecuted with the utmost vigor and a
   thorough-going military effectiveness, Bothon threw himself with an
   abounding energy which even his most ardent Ludektan admirers had not
   anticipated. At the end of an intensive campaign of less than three
   weeks, with this very dangerous revolt completely crushed and the
   leaders of the Gyaa-Hua hanging to a man by great hooks through their
   neck muscles in dreadful rows along the outer city walls on either side
   of the great archway that pierced the defense of Ludekta's capital, the
   General Bothon found himself the hero of Ludekta and the idol of his
   admiring troops. A rigid disciplinarian; the attitude of the officers
   and men of the Ludektan standing army towards this general had hitherto
   been based upon the respect which his great abilities had always
   commanded. Now he found himself the recipient of something almost like
   worship because of this last brilliant campaign of his. It had been a
   tour de force.

   Although it is highly probable that they would have advanced him
   because of this achievement in any event, the actual occasion for the
   action of the Ludektan Senate in rewarding Bothon with the supreme
   command of the standing army was the speech before that body of the
   aging generalissimo Tarba. Old Tarba ended his notable panegyric by
   laying his truncheon, emblem of the supreme command, on the great
   marble slab before the presiding senator, with a dramatic gesture.

   Bothon thus found himself suddenly possessed of that intensive hero
   worship which would cause the state to acquiesce in anything which its
   object might suggest. He was, at the same time, in supreme command of
   the largest sectional standing army of the entire continent of
   Atlantis; an army, thanks chiefly to his own efficiency, probably the
   best trained and most effective fighting unit then extant.

   Under the combined effect of the contributing causes and his new
   authority General Bothon made up his mind. On the eleventh day after
   his triumphal entry into Ludekta's capital city" forty-seven Ludektan
   war vessels freshly outfitted, their oar-slaves supplemented by a
   reserve of the Gyaa-Hau, selected for the power and endurance of their
   gorilla-like bodies, with new skin sails throughout the fleet, and the
   flower of the Ludektan army on board, sailed out from Ludekta westward
   for Alu under the command of the General Bothon.

   IT WAS precisely simultaneous with the arrival of this war fleet off
   the shores of the great city of Alu that there began unprecedented
   natural disturbances affecting the entire area of the mother continent.
   These were comparable to nothing recorded in the capital's carefully
   kept slate and parchment records, which went back over a period of
   thousands of years.

   The first presage of these impending calamities took the form of a
   coppery tinge which replaced the blue of the sky. Without any warning
   the long ground-swell of this Western Ocean changed abruptly, along
   with the color of the water, into a kind of dull brick-grey, to short,
   choppy, spray-capped waves. These tossed even the great Ludektan war
   galleys so violently as to shatter many of the sweeps. The wind, to the
   consternation of several of Bothon's captains, appeared to come from
   every quarter at once! It tore the heavy skin sails of the Ludektan
   galleys away from their copper rings and bolts in some cases. In others
   it split the sails in clean straight lines as though they had been slit
   with sharp knives.

   Undaunted by these manifestations and the reports of his augurs who had
   cast their lots and slain their sheep and fowls in a hasty series of
   divinations to account, if possible, for this unfavorable reception at
   the hands of the elements, the indomitable will of Bothon forced his
   fleet to an orderly landing. He sent forthwith as his herald to the
   Emperor himself, his highest ranking sub-general, accompanied by an
   imposing guard of honor. On slate tablets Bothon had set forth his
   demand in his own hand. This was in the form of a set of alternatives.
   The Emperor was asked to receive him as Generalissimo of the military
   forces of Ludekta, and to consent to his immediate marriage with the
   Netvissa Ledda; or, he, Bothon, would proceed forthwith to the siege of
   Alu and take the lady of his heart by force and arms.

   The message prayed the Emperor to elect the first alternative. It also
   set forth briefly and in formal heraldic terms the status of the
   ancient family of Bothon.

   The Emperor had been very seriously annoyed at this challenge, as he
   chose to regard it. He felt that his office and dignity had been
   outraged. He crucified Bothon's entire delegation.

   The siege of Alu began forthwith under that menacing copper-tinted sky
   and to the accompaniment of a rumbling series of little earthquakes.

   NOT only not within the memory of living men, but, as the records
   indicated, during its entire history over thousands of years as the
   metropolis of the civilized world, had there been any previous hostile
   manifestations against the great city of Alu. That anything like this
   terrible campaign which the renowned General Bothon of Ludekta set in
   motion against her might come to pass, had never even remotely occurred
   to anyone in Alu. So promptly did Bothon launch his attack that the
   tortured bodies of the members of his delegation to the Emperor had
   not' yet ceased writhing on their row of crosses before he had
   penetrated, at the head of his trained legionaries, to a point within
   two squares of the Imperial Palace which stood at the center of the
   great city.

   There had been virtually no resistance. This intensive campaign would
   have been triumphantly concluded within twenty minutes, the Emperor
   probably captured along with all his Palace guards and household, the
   person of the Lady Ledda secured by this ardent lover of hers, and the
   entire objective of the expedition accomplished, save for what in
   modern legal phraseology would have been described as An Act of God.

   The premonitory earth-shakings which had accompanied this armed
   invasion culminated, at that point in the advance of Bothon's army, in
   a terrific seismic cataclysm. The stone-paved streets opened in great
   gaping fissures. Massive buildings crashed tumultuously all about and
   upon the triumphantly advancing Ludektans. The General, Bothon, at the
   head of his troops, dazed and deafened and hurled violently upon the
   ground, retained consciousness long enough to see three quarters of his
   devoted following engulfed, smashed, torn to fragments, crushed into
   unrecognizable heaps of bloody pulp; and this holocaust swiftly and
   mercifully obliterated from before his failing vision by the drifting
   dust from millions of tons of crumbled masonry.

   He awakened in the innermost keep of the dungeon in Alu's citadel.

   COMING quietly into Meredith's bedroom about ten o'clock in the
   morning, Dr. Cowlington, who had made up his mind overnight on a
   certain matter, quietly led his initial conversation with his
   observation-patient around to the subject which had been most prominent
   in his mind since their conference of yesterday over the strange
   linguistic terms which Meredith had noted down.

   "It has occurred to me that I might very well tell you about something
   quite out of the ordinary which came under my notice seven or eight
   years ago. It happened while I was chief intern in the Connecticut
   State Hospital for the Insane. I served there for two years under Dr.
   Floyd Haviland before I went into private practice. We had a few
   private patients in the hospital, and one of these, who was in my
   particular charge, was a gentleman of middle-age who had come to us
   because of Haviland's enormous reputation, without commitment. This
   gentleman, whom I will call `Smith', was neither legally nor actually
   `insane'. His difficulty, which had interfered very seriously with the
   course of his life and affairs, would ordinarily be classified as
   `delusions'. He was with us for nearly two months. As a voluntary
   patient of the institution, and being a man of means, he had private
   rooms. He was in every way normal except for his intensive mental
   preoccupation with what I have called his delusions. In daily contact
   with him during this period I became convinced that Mr. Smith was not
   suffering from anything like a delusive affection of the mind.

   "I diagnosed his difficulty--and Dr. Haviland agreed with me--that this
   patient, Smith, was suffering mentally from the effects of an ancestral
   memory.

   "Such a case is so rare as to be virtually unique. The average
   psychiatrist would go through a life-time working at his specialty
   without encountering anything of the sort. There are, however, recorded
   cases. We were able to send our patient home in a mental condition of
   almost complete normality. As sometimes occurs in mental cases, his
   virtual cure was accomplished by making our diagnosis very clear to
   him--impressing upon his mind through reiterated and very positive
   statements that he was in no sense of the word demented, and that his
   condition, while unusual, was not outside the range and limitations of
   complete normality."

   "IT MUST have been a very interesting case" said Meredith. His reply
   was dictated by nothing deeper than a desire to be courteous. For his
   mind was full of the affairs of the General, Bothon, raging now in his
   prison-chamber; his mind harried, anxious over the fate of his
   surviving soldiers; that lurid glare, dimmed by the remoteness of his
   flame-tinted prison-chamber, in his eyes; his mind tortured and his
   keen sense of hearing stultified by the sustained, dreadful roaring of
   that implacable sea. He, Meredith, for reasons far too deep for his own
   analysis, felt utterly incapable of telling Dr. Cowlington what was
   transpiring in those dreams of his. All his inmost basic instincts were
   warning him, though subconsciously, that what he might tell now, if he
   would, could not possibly be believed! Dr. Cowlington, looking at his
   patient, saw a face drawn and lined as though from some devastating
   mental stress; a deeply introspective expression in the eyes, which,
   professionally speaking, he did not like. The doctor considered a
   moment before resuming, erect in his chair, his knees crossed, his
   finger-tips joined in a somewhat judicial attitude.

   "Frankly, Meredith, I emphasized the fact that the man I have called
   Smith was in no sense insane because I feel that I must go farther and
   tell you that the nature of his apparent "delusions' was, in one
   striking particular, related to your own case. I did not wish to give
   you the slightest alarm over the perfect soundness of your own
   mentality! To put the matter plainly, Mr. Smith remembered, although
   rather vaguely and dimly, certain phases of those ancestral memories I
   mentioned, and was able to reproduce a number of the terms of some
   unknown and apparently prehistoric language. Meredith --" the doctor
   turned and looked intensely into the eyes of his now interested
   patient, "--there were three or four of Smith's words identical with
   yours!"

   "Good God!" Meredith exclaimed, "What were the words, Doctor? Did you
   make notes of them?"

   "Yes, I have them here," answered the psychiatrist.

   Meredith was out of his chair and leaning eagerly over the doctor's
   shoulder long before Cowlington had his papers arranged. He gazed with
   a consuming intensity at the words and phrases carefully typed on
   several sheets of foolscap; listened, with an almost tremulous
   attention, while Dr. Cowlington carefully reproduced the sounds of
   these uncouth terms. Then, taking the sheets and resuming his chair, he
   read through all that had been written down, pronouncing the words,
   though very quietly, under his breath, his lips barely moving.

   HE WAS pale, and shaking from head to foot when he rose at last and
   handed back, hands trembling, the thin fascicle of papers to its owner.
   Dr. Cowlington looked at him anxiously, his professional mind alert,
   his fears somewhat aroused over the wisdom of this experiment of his in
   bringing his former case thus abruptly to his patient's attention. Dr.
   Cowlington felt, if he had cared to put his impression into words,
   somewhat baffled. He could not, despite his long and careful training
   in dealing with mental, nervous, and "borderland" cases, quite put his
   acute professional finger upon just which one of the known simple and
   complex emotions was, for this moment, dominating this very interesting
   patient of his.

   Dr. Cowlington would have been even more completely puzzled if he had
   known.

   For Meredith, reading through the strange babblings of the patient,
   Smith, had recognized all the words and terms, and had lit upon the
   phrase:

   "Our beloved Bothon has disappeared."

   Dr. Cowlington, sensing accurately that it might be unwise to prolong
   this particular interview, concluded wisely that Meredith would most
   readily regain his normal poise and equanimity if left alone to cope
   with whatever, for the time-being, held possession of his mind, rose
   quietly and walked over to the bedroom door.

   He paused there, however, for an instant, before leaving the room, and
   looked back at the man. Meredith had not, apparently, so much as noted
   the doctor's movements towards departure. His mind, very obviously, was
   turned inward. He was, it appeared, entirely oblivious to his
   surroundings.

   And Dr, Cowlington, whose professional outward deportment, acquired
   through years of contact with abnormal people, had not wholly
   obliterated a kindly disposition, noted with a certain emotion of his
   own that there were unchecked tears plainly visible in his patient's
   inward-gazing eyes.

   SUMMONED back to Meredith's room an hour later by one of his house
   nurses, Dr. Cowlington found his patient restored to his accustomer
   urbane normality.

   "I asked you to come up for a moment, Doctor," began Meredith, "because
   I wanted to inquire if there is anything that you would care to give a
   patient to induce sleep." Then, with a deprecating smile: "The only
   such things I know about are morphine and laudanum! I don't know very
   much about medicine and naturally you wouldn't want to give me one of
   those any more than I would want to take it."

   Dr. Cowlington resumed his judicial manner. He thought rapidly about
   this unexpected request. He took into consideration how his story about
   the patient, Smith, had appeared to upset Meredith. He deliberately
   refrained from inquiring why Meredith wanted a sleeping potion. Then he
   nodded his head.

   "I use a very simple preparation;" he said. "It is non-habit-forming;
   based on a rather dangerous drug, chloral; but, as I use it for my
   patients, compounded with an aromatic syrup and diluted with half a
   tumbler of water, it works very well. I will send some up to you but
   remember, please, four teaspoonfuls of the syrup is the outside dose.
   Two will probably be enough. Never more than four at any time, and not
   more than one dose in twenty-four hours."

   Dr. Cowlington rose, came over to Meredith, and looked at the place
   where he had struck the side of his head against the marble wall of his
   shower-bath. The bruise was still there. The doctor passed his fingers
   lightly over the contusion.

   "It's beginning to go down,' he remarked. Then he smiled pleasantly,
   again nodded his head at Meredith, and, started to leave. Meredith
   stopped him as he was about to go out of the room.

   "I wanted to ask you," said Meredith, "I wanted to ask you, Doctor, if
   you would be willing to put me in touch with the man to whom you
   referred as "Smith'?"

   The doctor shook his head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Smith died two years ago."

   IN TEN minutes the house nurse fetched in a small tray. On it was a
   tumbler, a mixing spoon, and a freshly put up eight-ounce bottle
   containing a reddish colored, pleasant tasting syrup.

   Twenty minutes later, Meredith, who had compromised on three teaspoons,
   was deeply asleep on his bed; and the General, Bothon, in the innermost
   dungeon chamber of the great citadel of Alu, was standing poised in the
   center of that dungeon's smooth stone floor, tensed to leap in any
   direction; while all about him the rending crashes of thousands of tons
   of the riven and falling masonry of the citadel itself was deafening
   him against all other sounds except the incessant and indescribably
   thunderous fury of the now utterly maddened ocean. The lurid glare of
   the tires from without had been markedly heightened. Detonation after
   detonation came to Bothon's ears at frequent intervals. The Aluans were
   blowing up this central portion of their great city, in order to check
   the advance of the conflagration which had raged for days and nights
   and was utterly beyond control. These detonations seemed actually faint
   to the alert man in that prison room against the hideous crashing of
   the sections of the citadel itself, and the sustained roar of the
   ocean.

   Abruptly the crisis for which he had been waiting arrived. The stone
   flooring beneath his feet buckled and sagged at his right. He whirled
   about and leaped far in the other direction, pressing himself, hands
   and arms stretched out above his head, against the wall of the
   prison-chamber, his heart pounding wildly, his breath coming in great
   gasps and sobs as the stifling, earthquake-deadened air about him
   shrank to a sudden and devastating attenuation. Then the solid wall
   opposite split in a tearing gap from top to bottom, and an even more
   stifling cloud of white dust sifted abruptly through the room as the
   ceiling was riven asunder.

   Stifling, choking, fighting for breath and life, the General, Bothon,
   lowered his arms and whirled about again in the direction of this
   thunderous breakage, and groped his way across the now precarious
   flooring in the faint hope of discovering an avenue of escape. He
   struggled up a steep mound of débris through the grey darkness of the
   hanging dust where a few seconds before there had been a level floor of
   solid masonry. He groped his way through thicker clouds of the
   drifting, settling stone-dust, skirted the irregular edges of yawning
   holes and toiled up and down mounded heaps of rubble, far past the
   place where the confining wall of his dungeon had stood, onward and
   forward resolutely towards that vague goal of freedom.

   At last, the resources of his mighty body spent, his eyes two tortured
   red holes, his mouth and throat one searing pain, Bothon emerged across
   the last hill of rubbish which had been the citadel of Alu and came out
   upon the corner edge of one of the largest of the city's great public
   squares.

   FOR the first time in the course of his progress out of that death
   trap, Bothon suddenly trod on something soft and yielding. He paused.
   He could hardly see, and he crouched and felt with his hands, under the
   thickly mounded dust.

   It was the body of a man, in chain mail. Bothon, exhaled a painful
   breath of satisfaction. He rolled the body over, freeing it from the
   pounds of dust upon it, and slid his hand along the copper-studded
   leather belt to where a short, heavy, one-handed battle-axe was
   attached. This he drew from its sheath.

   Then from the dead man's silken tunic he tore off a large section and
   cleansed his eyes and mouth and wiped the sweat-caked dust from his
   face.

   Finally he took from the corpse a heavy leathern purse. He lay down for
   a few moments beside the dead soldier on the soft dust for a brief
   rest. Some ten minutes later he rose, stretched himself, testing the
   heavy axe with three or four singing strokes through the clearing air,
   and dusted out and readjusted his garments, finally tightening a
   loosened sandal thong.

   He stood free now in the center of Alu. He was adequately armed. A
   great gust of energy surged through him. He oriented himself; then he
   turned with an instinct as sure as a homing bee's in the direction he
   had been seeking, and began to march at the unhurrying, space-devouring
   pace of a Ludektan legionary, straight for the Imperial Palace.

   Bothon had thoroughly settled in his mind the answer to a question
   which, for the first few days of his captivity had puzzled him greatly.
   Why had he been left alone and undisturbed in that confinement; food
   and water brought to him at regular intervals in accordance with the
   ordinary routine of the citadel? Why, to put the matter plainly, having
   been obviously captured by the Emperor's retainers while lying
   unconscious within two squares of the Imperial Palace, had he not been
   summarily crucified? His keen trained mind had apprised him that the
   answer was to be found in the hideous turmoil of the raging sea and in
   the fearful sounds of a disintegrating city. The Emperor had been too
   greatly occupied by those cataclysms even to command the punishment of
   this leader of such an armed attack against the world's metropolis as
   had not been known in all the long history of the mother continent.

   Skirting its enormous outer walls, Bothon came at last to the massive
   chief entrance-way to the Imperial Palace. This enormous structure, its
   basic walls eight feet thick, stood massive, magnificent, intact.
   Without any hesitation he began mounting the many broad steps straight
   towards the magnificent entrance-gates of copper and gold and porphyry.

   Before these gates, in the rigid line and under the command of an
   officer beneath whose corselet appeared the pale blue tunic of the
   Emperor's house-hold-guards, stood a dozen fully armed soldiers. One of
   these, at a word from the officer, ran down the steps to turn back this
   intruder. Bothon slew him with a single crashing stroke and continued
   to mount the steps. At this a shouted command of the officer sent the
   entire troop down the steps upon him in close order. Bothon paused, and
   waiting until the foremost was no more than the space of two of the
   broad steps above him, leaped lightly to his right. Then as the
   foremost four of the soldiers passed beyond him under the impetus of
   their downward charge, Bothon as lightly leaped back again, his heavy
   axe falling upon the troop's flank with deadly, short, quick-swinging
   blows.

   Before they could collect themselves the officer and five of his men
   lay dead upon the steps. Leaving the demoralized remainder to gather
   themselves together as best they might, Bothon leaped up the
   intervening steps and was through the great entrance-doors, and, with a
   pair of lightning-like right-and-left strokes of his axe, had disposed
   of the two men-at-arms stationed just inside the doorway.

   HIS way into the Palace now entirely unobstructed, Bothon sped through
   well-remembered rooms and along broad corridors into the heart of the
   Imperial Palace of Alu.

   Within thirty seconds he had located the entrance to the brother of the
   Emperor, Netvis Toldon's apartments, and had passed through the
   doorway.

   He discovered the family reclining about the horseshoe-shaped table in
   the refectory, for it was the hour of the evening meal. He paused in
   the doorway, was met with surprised glances, and bowed low to the
   Netvis Toldon.

   "I beseech you to pardon this intrusion, my Lord Netvis. It would be
   inexcusable under other circumstances, at a more favorable time." The
   nobleman returned no answer, only stared in surprise. Then, the dear
   lady of his heart, the Netvissa Ledda, rose to her feet from her place
   at her father's table, her eyes wide with wonderment. A dawning
   realization of what this strange invasion might mean, made her lovely
   face suddenly the hue of the Aluan roses, She looked at this heroically
   formed lover of hers, her soul in her eyes.

   "Come, my lady Ledda" said Bothon quickly, and as lightly as a deer the
   Netvissa Ledda ran to him.

   He took her arm, very quietly, and, before the assembled members of the
   family of Toldon had recovered from their surprise, the two were
   hastening along the corridor towards the palace entrance.

   From around the first corner before them came then abrupt sounds of
   armed men. They paused, listening, and Bothon shifted his axe into his
   right hand and stepped before the lady Ledda, but she laid firm hands
   upon his left arm. "This way, swiftly" she whispered, and led him down
   a narrow passageway at the wide corridor's left. This they traversed in
   haste, and had barely negotiated a sharp turn when they heard the
   guard-troop rush along the main corridor, and a voice, commanding:

   "To the apartment of my Lord, the Netvis Toldon!"

   The narrow passage-way led them past cook-rooms and scullery-chambers,
   and ended at a small door which opened upon a narrow court. Rapidly
   traversing this, they emerged upon a square at the west side of the
   palace, and well before any pursuit could have traced their course,
   were indistinguishable among the vast concourse of the people who
   thronged the wide avenues of Alu.

   Bothon now resumed the direction of their course of escape. Leading the
   way across a larger adjacent square, he reached the secluded corner,
   mounded about with débris, where he had secured his weapon. It was not
   yet past the early dusk of a mid-summer evening, and now there was
   nothing to interfere with his keen vision.

   Yes, it was as he had guessed from the quality of that torn fragment of
   silken tunic with which he had wiped his tortured eyes free of the
   stone-dust. The dead man was an officer of one of the Imperial Legions.

   Seating the Lady Ledda upon a block of granite and requesting her to
   watch, Bothon knelt swiftly beside the dead body and busied himself
   upon it.

   AT THE end of two intensive minutes the Netvissa Ledda looked up at his
   touch upon her shoulder to see her lover apparelled from head to foot
   in the uniform, armor, and accoutrements of an Elton of the Imperial
   Legion of the Hawk.

   Then they hurried southward, side by side, across the great square with
   its desolation of shattered buildings, towards one of the few remaining
   residences of the rich before which four coal-black slaves in the
   livery of their household were lowering an ornamental litter to the
   ground.

   From the luxurious vehicle, as they arrived beside it, there emerged a
   stout citizen who stared at them inquiringly, his initial fear
   disappearing at recognition of the Emperor's niece and the uniform of
   an Imperial Legion.

   "We request the loan of your litter, my lord," said Bothon.

   "Most willingly," returned the citizen, bowing. Bothon expressed
   thanks, handed his companion into the litter, distributed a handful of
   silver among the four slaves, and gave the destination to the Negro who
   stood beside the forward left-hand pole. Then he climbed in himself and
   drew the red silk curtains together.

   The strong litter-poles strained and creaked as the load was hoisted to
   four brawny shoulders, and then the litter swung away from the
   residence of its still bowing and smirking owner towards the military
   enclosure which housed and guarded the flying-vessels of the Aluvian
   standing army.

   "You may have observed how very completely I have entrusted my Imperial
   person to you," remarked the Netvissa Ledda, smiling. She was very well
   aware of the reasons for the Imperial request which had sent Bothon
   back to Ludekta, and for the first armed invasion against the Aluvian
   metropolis.

   "I have not so much as inquired as to our destination! "

   "It is my intention to seek safety to the northwest," answered Bothon
   gravely. "I am convinced the prediction of Bal, Lord of Fields, as to
   the destruction of the Mother Continent, is not a mere classic to be
   learned, as we learned it in our childhood, as a formal exercise in
   rhetoric, Here, all about us, is the evidence. More, my four augurs
   warned me of the continent's danger ere I brought my war-galleys up
   upon the beaches of Alu. The four great forces, they insisted, were in
   collusion to that end. Do we not see and hear them at work? Fire raging
   through the land; earth shaking mightily; winds such as never were
   encountered hitherto upon the planet, else the old records lie! Water,
   the commotion of which surpasses all experiences;--is it not so, my
   beloved? Am I not constrained to speak thus to be heard amidst this
   hellish tumult?"

   The Lady Ledda nodded, grave now in her turn.

   "There are many deafened in the palace," she remarked. "Where are we to
   go for refuge?"

   "We depart straight this night, for the great mountains of `A-Wah-Ii,"
   answered Bothon, "if so be the four great forces allow us possession of
   a war chariot. And, to that end, your ring, my beloved."

   THE Lady Ledda nodded again, understandingly, and removed from the
   middle finger of her right hand the ring of the two suns and the
   eight-pointed star which, as a member of the Royal Family, she was
   entitled to wear. Bothon received it, and slipped it upon the little
   finger of his right hand.

   The sentinel on guard before the barracks of the officer commanding the
   military enclosure of the Aluvian supply-barracks, saluted the
   commanding looking Elton of the Legion of the Hawk who stepped down
   from the ornamented litter. The Elton addressed him in formal military
   phrases.

   "Report at once to the Ka-Kalbo Netro, the arrival of the Elton Barko
   of the Legion of the Hawk, conveying a member of the Imperial household
   into exile. I am requisitioning one battle-chariot of capacity for two
   persons, and officer's rations sufficient for fourteen days, together
   with the medicinal supply for a full kit-va of men. My authority, the
   Imperial Signet. Behold!"

   The sentinel saluted the sun-and-star ring of the Emperor, repeated his
   orders like an efficient automaton, saluted the Elton of the Hawk
   Legion, and departed at the double to fetch the commandant, the
   Ka-Kalbo Netro.

   The Ka-Kalbo arrived promptly in answer to this summons. He saluted the
   Imperial Signet, and, as a Ka-Kalbo outranked an Elton by one full
   grade, was punctiliously saluted according to military usage by the
   Elton Barko of the Legion of the Hawk, an officer whose personal
   acquaintance he had not previously made.

   Within ten minutes the Netvissa Ledda had been ceremoniously carried to
   and placed upon her seat in the commandeered battle-chariot, and the
   Elton Barko had taken his place beside her. Then, the dozen sweating
   mechanicians who had carried out their commandant's orders in record
   time, standing in a stiff, saluting row, the battle-chariot started off
   at a stiff gallop, the driver standing and plying his long thong with
   loud, snapping reports over the horses' backs, while at the great
   chariot's rear the spare-horse leader whistled continuously to the four
   relay animals which galloped behind.

   The heights of `A-Wah-Ii, to the northwest, gave some promise, in
   Bothon's opinion, of security from the anciently predicted submersion
   of the continent. Those towering mountains would, at least, be among
   the last sections to sink, should the gas belts, hypothecated by the
   scientists of the mother continent, explode, and remove the underseas
   support of this great land of the globe's most ancient and noble
   civilization.

   Shortly after daybreak, and accurately, according to the map and
   careful explanations of the painstaking Ka-Kalbo Netro, the chariot
   paused in the centre of a great level table-land one quarter of the way
   to his destination. The country was utterly uninhabited. They were
   relatively safe here in a region only lightly visited by the
   earthquakes, and not at all by fire. The roar of the north wind
   troubled the Netvissa Ledda severely. Bothon barely noticed it. He was
   now convinced that he was losing his sense of hearing.

   They ate and slept and resumed their journey at noon after a
   readjustment of the provisions and a change of the now rested animals.

   Their four days' journey steadily northwest was uneventful. The
   charioteer drove onward steadily. On the fourth day, as the coppery
   ball which was the smoking sun reached and touched a flat horizon, they
   caught their first view of the lofty summits of the `A-Wah-Ii' region,
   a goal of a possible immunity.

   DR. COWLINGTON, an anxious look on his face, was standing beside
   Meredith's bed when he awakened in mid-morning. He had slept twenty
   hours. However, what the doctor thought of as his patient's mental
   condition was so entirely normal, and his cheerfulness so pronounced
   after his protracted sleep, that Dr. Cowlington was reassured, and
   changed his mind about removing the bottle of sleeping medicine.
   Plainly it had had an excellent effect on Meredith.

   Stretched out in his usual quiet-inducing attitude on the davenport
   just before lunch, Meredith suddenly ceased reading and put down his
   magazine, It had occurred to him that he had heard none of the turmoil
   of Alu during that waking period. He sat up, puzzled. Bothon, he
   remembered, had been hearing the sounds about him only dimly, a
   strange, perhaps a significant, coincidence.

   He felt the bruise behind his right ear. It was no longer even slightly
   painful to the touch. He pressed his finger-tips firmly against the
   place. The contusion was now barely perceptible to the sense of touch.

   He reported the apparent loss of what the ear-specialist Gatefield had
   named his "clairaudience" to Dr. Cowlington after lunch.

   "Your bruise is going down," said the doctor significantly. He examined
   the posterior edge of Meredith's right temporal area.

   "I thought so," remarked the doctor, nodding. "Your secondary `hearing'
   began with that injury to your head. As it goes down, some obscure
   stimulation of the auditory apparatus, which accounts for your ability
   to hear those sounds, diminishes accordingly. You could probably hear
   only some stupendous sound from there now. And in a day or so I predict
   that you will be hearing nothing more, and then you can, go home!"

   And, within an hour came the "stupendous sound" in very truth. It broke
   in upon Meredith's quiet reading once more as though someone had opened
   that sound-proof door.

   A curious, secondary, mental vision accompanied it. It was as though
   Meredith, in his own proper person, yet through the strange connection
   of his personality with the General, Bothon, stood on the heights of
   Tharan-Yud, overlooking the stricken city of Alu. The utter fury of
   mountainous waves accompanied the now titanic rumblings of malignant
   earth, the wholesale crashing of the cyclopean masonry of Alu as the
   vast city crumbled and melted beneath his horrified eyes. With these
   hellish horrors went the wild roaring of ravaging flame, and the
   despairing, hysterical cacophony of Alu's doomed millions.

   Then there came, at last, a sound as of the veritable yawning of the
   nethermost watery gulf of earth, and the high sun itself was blotted
   out by a monstrous green wall of advancing death. The sea rose up and
   fell upon accursed Alu, drowning forever the shrieks of utter despair,
   the piping and chittering of the obscurely gnawing Gyaa-Hua distracted
   at last from their loathsome banquet--hissings, roarings, shriekings,
   whinings, tearings, seethings--a cacophony more than human ears might
   bear, a sight of utter devastation more onerous than man might look
   upon, and live.

   THERE came to Meredith a merciful stupor, as the waters of Mu-Iadon
   closed in forever over the mother continent, and as his consciousness
   failed him, he emerged once more out of that quiet bedroom--away from
   his overlooking of the world's major catastrophe, and as Bothon, walked
   beside the Lady Ledda along a wooded ravine in `A o Wah-Ii,' goal of
   safety, among laden fruit trees, yet not, it seemed, upon the towering
   heights of those noble mountains but upon an island about the shores of
   which rolled and roared a brown and viscid ocean choked with the mud
   which had been the soil of the mother continent.

   "We are safe here, it would appear, my Bothon," said the Netvissa
   Ledda. "Let us lie down and sleep, for I am very weary."

   And after watching for a little space while the Lady Ledda reclined and
   slept, Bothon lay down beside her and fell at once into the deep and
   dreamless slumber of utter physical exhaustion.

   MEREDITH awakened on his davenport. The room was dark, and when he had
   risen, switched on the lights and looked at his watch, he found that it
   was four o'clock in the morning. He undressed and went to bed and
   awakened three hours later without having dreamed.

   A world and an era had come to its cataclysmic end, and he had been
   witness of it.

   The contusion on his head had disappeared, Dr. Cowlington observed
   later in the morning.

   "I think you can go home now, you'll never hear again," said the
   doctor, in his judicial manner. "But, by the way, Meredith, what, if
   you can remember, was the name of that `mother continent' of yours?"

   "We called it Mu," said Meredith. The doctor was silent for a while;
   then he nodded his head. He had made up his mind.

   "I thought so," said he, gravely.

   "Why?" Meredith asked.

   "Because Smith called it that," replied the doctor.

   Cats and Dogs
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   Written November 23, 1926. Published in Something About Cats and Other
   Pieces, Arkham House, 1949.
   14356Cats and DogsH. P. Lovecraft

   Being told of the cat-and-dog fight about to occur in your literary
   club, I cannot resist contributing a few Thomastic yowls and sibilants
   upon my side of the dispute, though conscious that the word of a
   venerable ex-member can scarcely have much weight against the
   brilliancy of such still active adherents as may bark upon the other
   side. Aware of my ineptitude at argument, a valued correspondent has
   supplied me with the records of a similar controversy in the New York
   Tribune, in which Mr. Carl van Doran is on my side and Mr. Albert
   Payson Terhune on that of the canine tribe. From this I would be glad
   to plagiarise such data as I need; but my friend, with genuinely
   Machiavellian subtlety, has furnished me with only a part of the feline
   section whilst submitting the doggish brief in full. No doubt he
   imagines that this arrangement, in view of my own emphatic bias, makes
   for something like ultimate fairness; but for me it is exceedingly
   inconvenient, since it will force me to be more or less original in
   several parts of the ensuing remarks.

   Between dogs and cats my degree of choice is so great that it would
   never occur to me to compare the two. I have no active dislike for
   dogs, any more than I have for monkeys, human beings, tradesmen, cows,
   sheep, or pterodactyls; but for the cat I have entertained a particular
   respect and affection ever since the earliest days of my infancy. In
   its flawless grace and superior self-sufficiency I have seen a symbol
   of the perfect beauty and bland impersonality of the universe itself,
   objectively considered, and in its air of silent mystery there resides
   for me all the wonder and fascination of the unknown. The dog appeals
   to cheap and facile emotions; the cat to the deepest founts of
   imagination and cosmic perception in the human mind. It is no accident
   that the contemplative Egyptians, together with such later poetic
   spirits as Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire and Swinburne, were all sincere
   worshippers of the supple grimalkin.

   Naturally, one's preference in the matter of cats and dogs depends
   wholly upon one's temperament and point of view. The dog would appear
   to me to be the favorite of superficial, sentimental, and emotional
   people -- people who feel rather than think, who attach importance to
   mankind and the popular conventional emotions of the simple, and who
   find their greatest consolation in the fawning and dependent
   attachments of a gregarious society. Such people live in a limited
   world of imagination; accepting uncritically the values of common
   folklore, and always preferring to have their naive beliefs, feelings,
   and prejudices tickled, rather than to enjoy a purely aesthetic and
   philosophic pleasure arising from discrimination, contemplation, and
   the recognition of austere, absolute beauty. This is not to say that
   the cheaper elements do not also reside in the average cat-lover's love
   of cats, but merely to point out that in ailurophily there exists a
   basis of true aestheticism which kynophily does not possess. The real
   lover of cats is one who demands a clearer adjustment to the universe
   than ordinary household platitudes provide; one who refuses to swallow
   the sentimental notion that all good people love dogs, children, and
   horses while all bad people dislike and are disliked by such. He is
   unwilling to set up himself and his cruder feelings as a measure of
   universal values, or to allow shallow ethical notions to warp his
   judgment. In a word, he had rather admire and respect than effuse and
   dote; and does not fall into the fallacy that pointless sociability and
   friendliness, or slavering devotion and obedience, constitute anything
   intrinsically admirable or exalted. Dog-lovers base their whole case on
   these commonplace, servile, and plebeian qualities, and amusingly judge
   the intelligence of a pet by its degree of conformity to their own
   wishes. Cat-lovers escape this delusion, repudiate the idea that
   cringing subservience and sidling companionship to man are supreme
   merits, and stand free to worship aristocratic independence,
   self-respect, and individual personality joined to extreme grace and
   beauty as typified by the cool, lithe, cynical and unconquered lord of
   the housetops.

   Persons of commonplace ideas -- unimaginative worthy burghers who are
   satisfied with the daily round of things and who subscribe to the
   popular credo of sentimental values -- will always be dog-lovers. To
   them nothing will ever be more important than themselves and their own
   primitive feelings, and they will never cease to esteem and glorify the
   fellow-animal who best typifies these. Such persons are submerged in
   the vortex of Oriental idealism and abasement which ruined classic
   civilisation in the Dark Ages, and live in a bleak world of abstract
   sentimental values wherein the mawkish illusions of meekness,
   gentleness, brotherhood, and whining humility are magnified into
   supreme virtues, and a whole false ethic and philosophy erected on the
   timid reactions of the flexor system of muscles. This heritage,
   ironically foisted on us when Roman politics raised the faith of a
   whipped and broken people to supremacy in the later empire, has
   naturally kept a strong hold over the weak and sentimentally
   thoughtless; and perhaps reached its culmination in the insipid
   nineteenth century, when people were wont to praise dogs "because they
   are so human" (as if humanity were any valid standard of merit!), and
   honest Edwin Landseer painted hundreds of smug Fidoes and Carlos and
   Rovers with all the anthropoid triviality, pettiness, and "cuteness" of
   eminent Victorians.

   But amidst this chaos of intellectual and emotional groveling a few
   free souls have always stood out for the old civilised realities which
   mediaevalism eclipsed -- the stern classic loyalty to truth, strength,
   and beauty given a clear mind and uncowed spirit to the full-living
   Western Aryan confronted by Nature's majesty, loveliness, and
   aloofness. This is the virile aesthetic and ethic of the extensor
   muscles -- the bold, buoyant, assertive beliefs and preferences of
   proud, dominant, unbroken and unterrified conquerors, hunters, and
   warriors -- and it has small use for the shams and whimperings of the
   brotherly, affection- slobbering peacemaker and cringer and
   sentimentalist. Beauty and sufficiency -- twin qualities of the cosmos
   itself -- are the gods of this unshackled and pagan type; to the
   worshipper of such eternal things the supreme virtue will not be found
   in lowliness, attachment, obedience, and emotional messiness. This sort
   of worshipper will look for that which best embodies the loveliness of
   the stars and the worlds and the forests and the seas and the sunsets,
   and which best acts out the blandness, lordliness, accuracy,
   self-sufficiency, cruelty, independence, and contemptuous and
   capricious impersonality of the all governing Nature. Beauty --
   coolness -- aloofness -- philosophic repose -- self-sufficiency --
   untamed mastery -- where else can we find these things incarnated with
   even half the perfection and completeness that mark their incarnation
   in the peerless and softly gliding cat, which performs its mysterious
   orbit with the relentless and obtrusive certainty of a planet in
   infinity?

   That dogs are dear to the unimaginative peasant-burgher whilst cats
   appeal to the sensitive poet-aristocrat- philosopher will be clear in a
   moment when we reflect on the matter of biological association.
   Practical plebeian folk judge a thing only by its immediate touch,
   taste, and smell; while more delicate types form their estimates from
   the linked images and ideas which the object calls up in their minds.
   Now when dogs and cats are considered, the stolid churl sees only the
   two animals before him, and bases his favour on their relative capacity
   to pander to his sloppy, uniformed ideas of ethics and friendship and
   flattering subservience. On the other hand the gentleman and thinker
   sees each in all its natural affiliations, and cannot fail to notice
   that in the great symmetries of organic life dogs fall in with slovenly
   wolves and foxes and jackals and coyotes and dingoes and painted
   hyaenas, whilst cats walk proudly with the jungle's lords, and own the
   haughty lion, the sinuous leopard, the regal tiger, and the shapely
   panther and jaguar as their kin. Dogs are the hieroglyphs of blind
   emotion, inferiority, servile attachment, and gregariousness -- the
   attributes of commonplace, stupidly passionate, and intellectually and
   imaginatively underdeveloped men. Cats are the runes of beauty,
   invincibility, wonder, pride, freedom, coldness, self-sufficiency, and
   dainty individuality -- the qualities of sensitive, enlightened,
   mentally developed, pagan, cynical, poetic, philosophic, dispassionate,
   reserved, independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master-class
   men. The dog is a peasant and the cat is a gentleman.

   We may, indeed, judge the tone and bias of a civilisation by its
   relative attitude toward dogs and cats. The proud Egypt wherein Pharaoh
   was Pharaoh and pyramids rose in beauty at the wish of him who dreamed
   them bowed down to the cat, and temples were built to its goddess at
   Bubastis. In imperial Rome the graceful leopard adorned most homes of
   quality, lounging in insolent beauty in the atrium with golden collar
   and chain; while after the age of the Antonines the actual cat was
   imported from Egypt and cherished as a rare and costly luxury. So much
   for the dominant and enlightened peoples. When, however, we come to the
   groveling Middle Ages with their superstitions and ecstasies and
   monasticisms and maunderings over saints and their relics, we find the
   cool and impersonal loveliness of the felidae in very low esteem; and
   behold a sorry spectacle of hatred and cruelty shown toward the
   beautiful little creature whose mousing virtues alone gained it
   sufferance amongst the ignorant churls who resented its self-respecting
   coolness and feared its cryptical and elusive independence as something
   akin to the dark powers of witchcraft. These boorish slaves of eastern
   darkness could not tolerate what did not serve their own cheap emotions
   and flimsy purposes. They wished a dog to fawn and hunt and fetch and
   carry, and had no use for the cat's gift of eternal disinterested
   beauty to feed the spirit. One can imagine how they must have resented
   Pussy's magnificent reposefulness, unhurriedness, relaxation, and scorn
   for trivial human aims and concernments. Throw a stick, and the servile
   dog wheezes and pants and stumbles to bring it to you. Do the same
   before a cat, and he will eye you with coolly polite and somewhat bored
   amusement. And just as inferior people prefer the inferior animal which
   scampers excitedly because someone else wants something, so do superior
   people respect the superior animal which lives its own life and knows
   that the puerile stick-throwings of alien bipeds are none of its
   business and beneath its notice. The dog barks and begs and tumbles to
   amuse you when you crack the whip. That pleases a meekness-loving
   peasant who relishes a stimulus to his self importance. The cat, on the
   other hand, charms you into playing for its benefit when it wishes to
   be amused; making you rush about the room with a paper on a string when
   it feels like exercise, but refusing all your attempts to make it play
   when it is not in the humour. That is personality and individuality and
   self-respect -- the calm mastery of a being whose life is its own and
   not yours -- and the superior person recognises and appreciates this
   because he too is a free soul whose position is assured, and whose only
   law is his own heritage and aesthetic sense. Altogether, we may see
   that the dog appeals to those primitive emotional souls whose chief
   demands on the universe are for meaningless affection, aimless
   companionship, and flattering attention and subservience; whilst the
   cat reigns among those more contemplative and imaginative spirits who
   ask of the universe only the objective sight of poignant, ethereal
   beauty and the animate symbolisation of Nature's bland, relentless,
   reposeful, unhurried and impersonal order and sufficiency. The dog
   gives, but the cat is.

   Simple folk always overstress the ethical element in life, and it is
   quite natural that they should extend it to the realm of their pets.
   Accordingly, we hear many inane dicta in favour of dogs on the ground
   that they are faithful, whilst cats are treacherous. Now just what does
   this really mean? Where are the points of reference? Certainly, the dog
   has so little imagination and individuality that it knows no motives
   but its master's; but what sophisticated mind can descry a positive
   virtue in this stupid abnegation of its birthright? Discrimination must
   surely award the palm to the superior cat, which has too much natural
   dignity to accept any scheme of things but its own, and which
   consequently cares not one whit what any clumsy human thinks or wishes
   or expects of it. It is not treacherous, because it has never
   acknowledged any allegiance to anything outside its own leisurely
   wishes; and treachery basically implies a departure from some covenant
   explicitly recognised. The cat is a realist, and no hypocrite. He takes
   what pleases him when he wants it, and gives no promises. He never
   leads you to expect more from him than he gives, and if you choose to
   be stupidly Victorian enough to mistake his purrs and rubbings of
   self-satisfaction for marks of transient affection toward you, that is
   no fault of his. He would not for a moment have you believe that he
   wants more of you than food and warmth and shelter and amusement -- and
   he is certainly justified in criticising your aesthetic and imaginative
   development if you fail to find his grace, beauty, and cheerful
   decorative influence an aboundingly sufficient repayment for all you
   give him. The cat-lover need not be amazed at another's love for dogs
   -- indeed, he may also possess this quality himself; for dogs are often
   very comely, and as lovable in a condescending way as a faithful old
   servant or tenant in the eyes of a master -- but he cannot help feeling
   astonished at those who do not share his love for cats. The cat is such
   a perfect symbol of beauty and superiority that it seems scarcely
   possible for any true aesthete and civilised cynic to do other than
   worship it. We call ourselves a dog's "master" -- but who ever dared
   call himself the "master" of a cat? We own a dog -- he is with us as a
   slave and inferior because we wish him to be. But we entertain a cat --
   he adorns our hearth as a guest, fellow-lodger, and equal because he
   wishes to be there. It is no compliment to be the stupidly idolised
   master of a dog whose instinct it is to idolise, but it is a very
   distinct tribute to be chosen as the friend and confidant of a
   philosophic cat who is wholly his own master and could easily choose
   another companion if he found such a one more agreeable and
   interesting. A trace, I think, of this great truth regarding the higher
   dignity of the cat has crept into folklore in the use of the names
   "cat" and "dog" as terms of opprobrium. Whilst "cat" has never been
   applied to any sort of offender more than the mildly spiteful and
   innocuously sly female gossip and commentator, the words "dog" and
   "cur" have always been linked with vileness, dishonor, and degradation
   of the gravest type. In the crystallisation of this nomenclature there
   has undoubtedly been present in the popular mind some dim,
   half-unconscious realisation that there are depths of slinking,
   whining, fawning, and servile ignobility which no kith of the lion and
   the leopard could ever attain. The cat may fall low, but he is always
   unbroken. He is, like the Nordic among men, one of those who govern
   their own lives or die.

   We have but to glance analytically at the two animals to see the points
   pile up in favour of the cat. Beauty, which is probably the only thing
   of any basic significance in all the cosmos, ought to be our chief
   criterion; and here the cat excels so brilliantly that all comparisons
   collapse. Some dogs, it is true, have beauty in a very ample degree;
   but even the highest level of canine beauty falls far below the feline
   average. The cat is classic whilst the dog is Gothic -- nowhere in the
   animal world can we discover such really Hellenic perfection of form,
   with anatomy adapted to function, as in the felidae. Puss is a Doric
   temple -- an Ionic colonnade -- in the utter classicism of its
   structural and decorative harmonies. And this is just as true
   kinetically as statically, for art has no parallel for the bewitching
   grace of the cat's slightest motion. The sheer, perfect aestheticism of
   kitty's lazy stretchings, industrious face-washings, playful rollings,
   and little involuntary shiftings in sleep is something as keen and
   vital as the best pastoral poetry or genre painting; whilst the
   unerring accuracy of his leaping and springing, running and hunting,
   has an art-value just as high in a more spirited way but it is his
   capacity for leisure and repose which makes the cat preeminent. Mr.
   Carl Van Vechten, in "Peter Whiffle," holds up the timeless restfulness
   of the cat as a model for life's philosophy, and Prof. William Lyon
   Phelps has very effectively captured the secret of felinity when he
   says that the cat does not merely lie down, but "pours his body out on
   the floor like a glass of water". What other creature has thus merged
   the aestheticism of mechanics and hydraulics? Contrast this with the
   inept panting, wheezing, fumbling, drooling, scratching, and general
   clumsiness of the average dog with his false and wasted motions. And in
   the details of neatness the fastidious cat is of course immeasurably
   ahead. We always love to touch a cat, but only the insensitive can
   uniformly welcome the frantic and humid nuzzlings and pawings of a
   dusty and perhaps not inodorous canine which leaps and fusses and
   writhes about in awkward feverishness for no particular reason save
   that blind nerve-centres have been spurred by certain meaningless
   stimuli. There is a wearying excess of bad manners in all this doggish
   fury -- well-bred people don't paw and maul one, and surely enough we
   invariably find the cat gentle and reserved in his advances, and
   delicate even when he glides gracefully into your lap with cultivated
   purrs, or leaps whimsical on the table where you are writing to play
   with your pen in modulated, seriocomic pats. I do not wonder that
   Mahomet, that sheik of perfect manners, loved cats for their urbanity
   and disliked dogs for their boorishness; or that cats are the favorites
   in the polite Latin countries whilst dogs take the lead in heavy,
   practical, and beer-drinking Central Europe. Watch a cat eat, and then
   watch a dog. The one is held in check by an inherent and inescapable
   daintiness, and lends a kind of grace to one of the most ungraceful of
   all processes. The dog, on the other hand, is wholly repulsive in his
   bestial and insatiate greediness; living up to his forest kinship of
   "wolfing" most openly and unashamedly. Returning to beauty of line --
   is it not significant that while many normal breeds of dogs are
   conspicuously and admittedly ugly, no healthy and well-developed feline
   of any species whatsoever is other than beautiful? There are, of
   course, many ugly cats; but these are always individual cases of
   mongrelism, malnutrition, deformity, or injury. No breed of cats in its
   proper condition can by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as
   even slightly ungraceful -- a record against which must be pitted the
   depressing spectacle of impossibly flattened bulldogs, grotesquely
   elongated dachshunds, hideously shapeless and shaggy Airedales, and'
   the like. Of course, it may be said that no aesthetic standard is other
   than relative -- but we always work with such standards as we
   empirically have, and in comparing cats and dogs under the Western
   European aesthetic we cannot be unfair to either. If any undiscovered
   tribe in Tibet finds Airedales beautiful and Persian cats ugly, we will
   not dispute them on their own territory -- but just now we are dealing
   with ourselves and our territory, and here the verdict would not admit
   of much doubt even from the most ardent kynophile. Such an one usually
   passes the problem off in an epigrammatic paradox, and says that
   "Snookums is so homely, he's pretty!" This is the childish penchant for
   the grotesque and tawdrily "cute" which we see likewise embodied in
   popular cartoons, freak dolls, and all the malformed decorative
   trumpery of the "Billikin" or "Krazy Kat" order found in the "dens" and
   "cosy corners" of the would-be-sophisticated yokelry.

   In the matter of intelligence we find the caninites making amusing
   claims -- amusing because they so naively measure what they conceive to
   be an animal's intelligence by its degree of subservience to the human
   will. A dog will retrieve, a cat will not; therefore (sic!) the dog is
   the more intelligent. Dogs can be more elaborately trained for the
   circus and vaudeville acts than cats, therefore (O Zeus, O Royal
   Mount!) they are cerebrally superior. Now of course this is all the
   sheerest nonsense. We would not call a weak-spirited man more
   intelligent than an independent citizen because we can make him vote as
   we wish whereas we can't influence the independent citizen, yet
   countless persons apply an exactly parallel argument in appraising the
   grey matter of dogs and cats. Competition in servility is something to
   which no self-respecting Thomas or Tabitha ever stooped, and it is
   plain that any really effective estimate of canine and feline
   intelligence must proceed from a careful observation of dogs and cats
   in a detached state -- uninfluenced by human beings -- as they
   formulate certain objectives of their own and use their own mental
   equipment in achieving them. When we do this, we arrive at a very
   wholesome respect for our purring hearthside friend who makes so little
   display about his wishes and business methods; for in every conception
   and calculation he shows a steel--cold and deliberate union of
   intellect, will, and sense of proportion which puts utterly to shame
   the emotional sloppings-over and docilely acquired artificial tricks of
   the "clever" and "faithful" pointer or sheep-dog. Watch a cat decide to
   move through a door, and see how patiently he waits for his
   opportunity, never losing sight of his purpose even when he finds it
   expedient to feign other interests in the interim. Watch him in the
   thick of the chase, and compare his calculating patience and quite
   study of his terrain with the noisy floundering and pawing of his
   canine rival. It is not often that he returns empty-handed. He knows
   what he wants, and means to get it in the most effective way, even at
   the sacrifice of time -- which he philosophically recognises as
   unimportant in the aimless cosmos. There is no turning him aside or
   distracting his attention -- and we know that among humans this is the
   quality of mental tenacity, this ability to carry a single thread
   through complex distractions, is considered a pretty good sign of
   intellectual vigour and maturity. Children, old crones, peasants, and
   dogs ramble, cats and philosophers stick to their point. In
   resourcefulness, too, the cat attests his superiority. Dogs can be well
   trained to do a single thing, but psychologists tell us that these
   responses to an automatic memory instilled from outside are of little
   worth as indices of real intelligence. To judge the abstract
   development of a brain, confront it with new and unfamiliar conditions
   and see how well its own strength enables it to achieve its object by
   sheer reasoning without blazed trails. Here the cats can silently
   devise a dozen mysterious and successful alternatives whilst poor Fido
   is barking in bewilderment and wondering what it is all about. Granted
   that Rover the retriever may make a greater bid for popular sentimental
   regard by going into the burning house and saving the baby in
   traditional cinema fashion, it remains a fact that whiskered and
   purring Nig is a higher-grade biological organism -- something
   physiologically and psychologically nearer a man because of his very
   freedom from man's orders, and as such entitled to a higher respect
   from those who judge by purely philosophic and aesthetic standards. We
   can respect a cat as we cannot respect a dog, no matter which
   personally appeals the more to our mere doting fancy; and if we be
   aesthetes and analysts rather than commonplace-lovers and
   emotionalists, the scales must inevitably turn completely in kitty's
   favour.

   It may be added, moreover, that even the aloof and sufficient cat is by
   no means devoid of sentimental appeal. Once we get rid of the
   uncivilised ethical bias -- the "treacherous" and "horrid bird-catcher"
   prejudice -- we find in the "harmless cat" the very apex of happy
   domestic symbolism; whilst small kittens become objects to adore,
   idealise, and celebrate in the most rhapsodic of dactyls and anapaests,
   iambics and trochaics. I, in my own senescent mellowness, confess to an
   inordinate and wholly unphilosophic predilection for tiny coal-black
   kittens with large yellow eyes, and could no more pass one without
   petting him than Dr. Johnson could pass a sidewalk post without
   striking it. There is, likewise, in many cats quite analogous to the
   reciprocal fondness so loudly extolled in dogs, human beings, horses,
   and the like. Cats come to associate certain persons with acts
   continuously contributing to their pleasure, and acquire for them a
   recognition and attachment which manifests itself in pleasant
   excitement at their approach -- whether or not bearing food and drink
   -- and a certain pensiveness at their protracted absence. A cat with
   whom I was on intimate terms reached the point of accepting food from
   no hand but one, and would actually go hungry rather than touch the
   least morsel from a kindly neighbour source. He also had distinct
   affections amongst the other cats of that idyllic household;
   voluntarily offering food to one of his whiskered friends, whilst
   disputing most savagely the least glance which his coal-black rival
   "Snowball" would bestow upon his plate. If it be argued that these
   feline fondnesses are essentially "selfish" and "practical" in their
   ultimate composition, let us inquire in return how many human
   fondnesses, apart from those springing directly upon primitive brute
   instinct, have any other basis. After the returning board has brought
   in the grand total of zero we shall be better able to refrain from
   ingenuous censure of the "selfish" cat.

   The superior imaginative inner life of the cat, resulting in superior
   self-possession, is well known. A dog is a pitiful thing, depending
   wholly on companionship, and utterly lost except in packs or by the
   side of his master. Leave him alone and he does not know what to do
   except bark and howl and trot about till sheer exhaustion forces him to
   sleep. A cat, however, is never without the potentialities of
   contentment. Like a superior man, he knows how to be alone and happy.
   Once he looks about and finds no one to amuse him, he settles down to
   the task of amusing himself; and no one really knows cats without
   having occasionally peeked stealthily at some lively and well- balanced
   kitten which believes itself to be alone. Only after such a glimpse of
   unaffected tail-chasing grace and unstudied purring can one fully
   understand the charm of those lines which Coleridge wrote with
   reference to the human rather than the feline young -- page eleven
   ".... a limber elf,
   Singing, dancing to itself."

   But whole volumes could be written on the playing of cats, since the
   varieties and aesthetic aspects of such sportiveness are infinite. Be
   it sufficient to say that in such pastimes cats have exhibited traits
   and actions which psychologists authentically declare to be motivated
   by genuine humour and whimsicality in its purest sense; so that the
   task of "making a cat laugh" may not be so impossible a thing even
   outside the borders of Cheshire. In short, a dog is an incomplete
   thing. Like an inferior man, he needs emotional stimuli from outside,
   and must set something artificial up as a god and motive. The cat,
   however, is perfect in himself. Like the human philosopher, he is a
   self- sufficient entity and microcosm. He is a real and integrated
   being because he thinks and feels himself to be such, whereas the dog
   can conceive of himself only in relation to something else. Whip a dog
   and he licks your hand -frauth! The beast has no idea of himself except
   as an inferior part of an organism whereof you are the superior part --
   he would no more think of striking back at you than you would think of
   pounding your own head when it punishes you with a headache. But whip a
   cat and watch it glare and move backward hissing in outraged dignity
   and self-respect! One more blow, and it strikes you in return; for it
   is a gentleman and your equal, and will accept no infringement on its
   personality and body of privileges. It is only in your house anyway
   because it wishes to be, or perhaps even as a condescending favour to
   yourself. It is the house, not you, it likes; for philosophers realise
   that human beings are at best only minor adjuncts to scenery. Go one
   step too far, and it leaves you altogether. You have mistaken your
   relationship to it and imagined you are its master, and no real cat can
   tolerate that breach of good manners. Henceforward it will seek
   companions of greater discrimination and clearer perspective. Let
   anaemic persons who believe in "turning the other cheek" console
   themselves with cringing dogs -- for the robust pagan with the blood of
   Nordic twilights in his veins there is no beast like the cat; intrepid
   steed of Freya, who can boldly look even Thor and Odin full in the face
   and stare with great round eyes of undimmed yellow or green.

   In these observations I believe I have outlined with some fullness the
   diverse reasons why, in my opinion and in the smartly timed
   title-phrase of Mr. Van Doren, "gentlemen prefer cats." The reply of
   Mr.Terhune in a subsequent issue of the Tribune appears to me beside
   the point; insomuch as it is less a refutation of facts than a mere
   personal affirmation of the author's membership in that conventional
   "very human" majority who take affection and companionship seriously,
   enjoy being important to something alive, hate a "parasite" on mere
   ethical ground without consulting the right of beauty to exist for ½its
   own sake, and therefore love man's noblest and most faithful friend,
   the perennial dog. I suppose Mr.Terhune loves horses and babies also,
   for the three go conventionally together in the great
   hundred-per-center's credo as highly essential likings for every good
   and lovable he-man of the Arrow Collar and Harold Bell Wright hero
   school, even though the automobile and Margaret Sanger have done much
   to reduce the last two items.

   Dogs, then, are peasants and the pets of peasants, cats are gentlemen
   and the pets of gentlemen. The dog is for him who places crude feeling
   and outgrown ethic and humanocentricity above austere and disinterested
   beauty; who just loves "folks and folksiness" and doesn't mind sloppy
   clumsiness if only something will truly care for him. (Tableau of dog
   across master's grave -- cf. Lanseer, "The Old Shepherd's Chief
   Mourner.") The guy who isn't much for highbrow stuff, but is always on
   the square and don't (sic) often find the Saddypost or the N.Y. World
   too deep for him; who hadn't much use for Valentino, but thinks Doug
   Fairbanks is just about right for an evening's entertainment. Wholesome
   -- constructive -- non-morbid -- civic-minded -- domestic -- (I forgot
   to mention the radio) normal -- that's the sort of go-getter that ought
   to go in for dogs.

   The cat is for the aristocrat -- whether by birth or inclinations or
   both - who admires his fellow-aristocrats. He is for the man who
   appreciates beauty as the one living force in a blind and purposeless
   universe, and who worships that beauty in all its forms without regard
   for the sentimental and ethical illusions of the moment. For the man
   who knows the hollowness of feeling and the emptiness of human objects
   and aspirations, and who therefore clings solely to what is real -- as
   beauty is real because it pretends to a significance beyond the emotion
   which it excites and is. For the man who feels sufficient in the
   cosmos, and asks no scruples of conventional prejudice, but loves
   repose and strength and freedom and luxury and sufficiency and
   contemplation; who as a strong fearless soul wishes something to
   respect instead of something to lick his face and accept his alternate
   blows and strokings; who seeks a proud and beautiful equal in the
   peerage of individualism rather than a cowed and cringing satellite in
   the hierarchy of fear, subservience, and devolution. The cat is not for
   the brisk, self-important little worker with a mission" , but for the
   enlightened dreaming poet who knows that the world contains nothing
   really worth doing. The dilettante -- the connoisseur -- the decadent,
   if you will, though in a healthier age than this there were things for
   such men to do, so that they were the planners and leader of those
   glorious pagan times. The cat is for him who does things not for empty
   duty but for power, pleasure, splendour, romance, and glamour -- for
   the harpist who sings alone in the night of old battles, or the warrior
   who goes out to fight such battles for beauty, glory, fame and the
   splendour of a land athwart which no shadow of weakness falls. For him
   who will be lulled by no sops of prose and usefulness, but demands for
   his comfort the ease and beauty and ascendancy and cultivation which
   make effort worth while. For the man who knows that play, not work, and
   leisure, not bustle, are the great things of life; and that the round
   of striving merely in order to strive some more is a bitter irony of
   which the civilised soul accepts as little as it can.

   Beauty, sufficiency, ease, and good manners -- what more can
   civilisation require? We have them all in the divine monarch who
   lounges gloriously on his silken cushion before the hearth. Loveliness
   and joy for their own sake -- pride and harmony and coordination --
   spirit, restfulness and completeness -- all here are present, and need
   but a sympathetic disillusionment for worship in full measure. What
   fully civilised soul but would eagerly serve as high priest of Bast?
   The star of the cat, I think, is just now in the ascendant, as we
   emerge little by little from the dreams of ethics and conformity which
   clouded the nineteenth century and raised the grubbing and unlovely dog
   to the pinnacle of sentimental regard. Whether a renaissance of power
   and beauty will restore our Western civilisation, or whether the forces
   of disintegration are already too powerful for any hand to check, none
   may yet say, but in the present moment of cynical world-unmasking
   between the pretence of the eighteen-hundreds and the ominous mystery
   of the decades ahead we have at least a flash of the old pagan
   perspective and the old pagan clearness and honesty.

   And one idol lit up by that flash, seen fair and lovely on a
   dream-throne of silk and gold under a chryselephantine dome, is a shape
   of deathless grace not always given its due among groping mortals --
   the haughty, the unconquered, the mysterious, the luxurious, the
   Babylonian, the impersonal, the eternal companion of superiority and
   art -- the type of perfect beauty and the brother of poetry -- the
   bland, grave, compliant, and patrician cat.

   In a dream Kuranes saw the city in the valley, and the seacoast beyond,
   and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys
   that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets
   the sky. In a dream it was also that he came by his name of Kuranes,
   for when awake he was called by another name.
         Perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name; for he was
   the last of his family, and alone among the indifferent millions of
   London, so there were not many to speak to him and to remind him who he
   had been. His money and lands were gone, and he did not care for the
   ways of the people about him, but preferred to dream and write of his
   dreams. What he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he showed it, so
   that after a time he kept his writings to himself, and finally ceased
   to write.
         The more he withdrew from the world about him, the more wonderful
   became his dreams; and it would have been quite futile to try to
   describe them on paper. Kuranes was not modern, and did not think like
   others who wrote. Whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered
   robes of myth and to show in naked ugliness the foul thing that is
   reality, Kuranes sought for beauty alone. When truth and experience
   failed to reveal it, he sought it in fancy and illusion, and found it
   on his very doorstep, amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and
   dreams.
         There are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to
   them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we
   listen and dream, we think but half-formed thoughts, and when as men we
   try to remember, we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life. But
   some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills
   and gardens, of fountains that sing in the sun, of golden cliffs
   overhanging murmuring seas, of plains that stretch down to sleeping
   cities of bronze and stone, and of shadowy companies of heroes that
   ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests; and
   then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that
   world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappy.
         Kuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood. He
   had been dreaming of the house where he had been born; the great stone
   house covered with ivy, where thirteen generations of his ancestors had
   lived, and where he had hoped to die. It was moonlight, and he had
   stolen out into the fragrant summer night, through the gardens, down
   the terraces, past the great oaks of the park, and along the long white
   road to the village. The village seemed very old, eaten away at the
   edge like the moon which had commenced to wane, and Kuranes wondered
   whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death. In the
   streets were spears of long grass, and the window-panes on either side
   broken or filmily staring. Kuranes had not lingered, but had plodded on
   as though summoned toward some goal. He dared not disobey the summons
   for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of
   waking life, which do not lead to any goal. Then he had been drawn down
   a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs,
   and had come to the end of things to the precipice and the abyss where
   all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing
   emptiness of infinity, and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit
   by the crumbling moon and the peering stars. Faith had urged him on,
   over the precipice and into the gulf, where he had floated down, down,
   down; past dark, shapeless, undreamed dreams, faintly glowing spheres
   that may have been partly dreamed dreams, and laughing winged things
   that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds. Then a rift seemed
   to open in the darkness before him, and he saw the city of the valley,
   glistening radiantly far, far below, with a background of sea and sky,
   and a snowcapped mountain near the shore.
         Kuranes had awakened the very moment he beheld the city, yet he
   knew from his brief glance that it was none other than Celephaïs, in
   the Valley of Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills where his spirit
   had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long
   ago, when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm sea-breeze
   lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the
   village. He had protested then, when they had found him, waked him, and
   carried him home, for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail
   in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the
   sky. And now he was equally resentful of awaking, for he had found his
   fabulous city after forty weary years.
         But three nights afterward Kuranes came again to Celephaïs. As
   before, he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead, and of
   the abyss down which one must float silently; then the rift appeared
   again, and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city, and saw the
   graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour, and watched the
   gingko trees of Mount Aran swaying in the sea-breeze. But this time he
   was not snatched away, and like a winged being settled gradually over a
   grassy hillside til finally his feet rested gently on the turf. He had
   indeed come back to the Valley of Ooth-Nargai and the splendid city of
   Celephaïs.
         Down the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked
   Kuranes, over the bubbling Naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he
   had carved his name so many years ago, and through the whispering grove
   to the great stone bridge by the city gate. All was as of old, nor were
   the marble walls discoloured, nor the polished bronze statues upon them
   tarnished. And Kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he
   knew be vanished; for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same,
   and still as young as he remembered them. When he entered the city,
   past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements, the merchants and
   camel-drivers greeted him as if he had never been away; and it was the
   same at the turquoise temple of Nath-Horthath, where the
   orchid-wreathed priests told him that there is no time in Ooth-Nargai,
   but only perpetual youth. Then Kuranes walked through the Street of
   Pillars to the seaward wall, where gathered the traders and sailors,
   and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky. There he
   stayed long, gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples
   sparkled beneath an unknown sun, and where rode lightly the galleys
   from far places over the water. And he gazed also upon Mount Aran
   rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying
   trees and its white summit touching the sky.
         More than ever Kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far
   places of which he had heard so many strange tales, and he sought again
   the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago. He found the man,
   Athib, sitting on the same chest of spice he had sat upon before, and
   Athib seemed not to realize that any time had passed. Then the two
   rowed to a galley in the harbour, and giving orders to the oarmen,
   commenced to sail out into the billowy Cerenarian Sea that leads to the
   sky. For several days they glided undulatingly over the water, till
   finally they came to the horizon, where the sea meets the sky. Here the
   galley paused not at all, but floated easily in the blue of the sky
   among fleecy clouds tinted with rose. And far beneath the keel Kuranes
   could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty,
   spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or
   disappear. At length Athib told him that their journey was near its
   end, and that they would soon enter the harbour of Serannian, the pink
   marble city of the clouds, which is built on that ethereal coast where
   the west wind flows into the sky; but as the highest of the city's
   carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space, and
   Kuranes awaked in his London garret.
         For many months after that Kuranes sought the marvellous city of
   Celephaïs and its sky-bound galleys in vain; and though his dreams
   carried him to many gorgeous and unheard-of places, no one whom he met
   could tell him how to find Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills. One
   night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint, lone
   campfires at great distances apart, and strange, shaggy herds with
   tinkling bells on the leaders, and in the wildest part of this hilly
   country, so remote that few men could ever have seen it, he found a
   hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges
   and valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands, and of
   such a length that neither end of it could be seen. Beyond that wall in
   the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees, and
   when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers, green
   foliage and lawns, white paths, diamond brooks, blue lakelets, carven
   bridges, and red-roofed pagodas, that he for a moment forgot Celephaïs
   in sheer delight. But he remembered it again when he walked down a
   white path toward a red-roofed pagoda, and would have questioned the
   people of this land about it, had he not found that there were no
   people there, but only birds and bees and butterflies. On another night
   Kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a
   tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon;
   and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought
   he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before. He
   would have descended and asked the way to Ooth-Nargai had not a
   fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon,
   showing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the
   reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since
   King Kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of
   the gods.
         So Kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of
   Celephaïs and its galleys that sail to Serannian in the sky, meanwhile
   seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the high-priest not
   to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and
   dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery in the cold desert
   plateau of Leng. In time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of
   day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of
   sleep. Hasheesh helped a great deal, and once sent him to a part of
   space where form does not exist, but where glowing gases study the
   secrets of existence. And a violet-coloured gas told him that this part
   of space was outside what he had called infinity. The gas had not heard
   of planets and organisms before, but identified Kuranes merely as one
   from the infinity where matter, energy, and gravitation exist. Kuranes
   was now very anxious to return to minaret-studded Celephaïs, and
   increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more money left,
   and could buy no drugs. Then one summer day he was turned out of his
   garret, and wandered aimlessly through the streets, drifting over a
   bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner. And it was
   there that fulfillment came, and he met the cortege of knights come
   from Celephaïs to bear him thither forever.
         Handsome knights they were, astride roan horses and clad in
   shining armour with tabards of cloth-of-gold curiously emblazoned. So
   numerous were they, that Kuranes almost mistook them for an army, but
   they were sent in his honour; since it was he who had created
   Ooth-Nargai in his dreams, on which account he was now to be appointed
   its chief god for evermore. Then they gave Kuranes a horse and placed
   him at the head of the cavalcade, and all rode majestically through the
   downs of Surrey and onward toward the region where Kuranes and his
   ancestors were born. It was very strange, but as the riders went on
   they seemed to gallop back through time; for whenever they passed
   through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and
   villagers as Chaucer or men before him might have seen, and sometimes
   they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers. When
   it grew dark they travelled more swiftly, till soon they were flying
   uncannily as if in the air. In the dim dawn they came upon the village
   which Kuranes had seen alive in his childhood, and asleep or dead in
   his dreams. It was alive now, and early villagers curtsied as the
   horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that
   ends in the abyss of dreams. Kuranes had previously entered that abyss
   only at night, and wondered what it would look like by day; so he
   watched anxiously as the column approached its brink. Just as they
   galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came
   somewhere out of the west and hid all the landscape in effulgent
   draperies. The abyss was a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean
   splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly
   entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past
   glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly down the horsemen
   floated, their chargers pawing the aether] as if galloping over golden
   sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater
   brightness, the brightness of the city Celephaïs, and the sea coast
   beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted
   galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the
   sea meets the sky.
         And Kuranes reigned thereafter over Ooth-Nargai and all the
   neighboring regions of dream, and held his court alternately in
   Celephaïs and in the cloud-fashioned Serannian. He reigns there still,
   and will reign happily for ever, though below the cliffs at Innsmouth
   the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had
   stumbled through the half-deserted village at dawn; played mockingly,
   and cast it upon the rocks by ivy-covered Trevor Towers, where a
   notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the
   purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility.

   The cottage hearth beams warm and bright,
   The candles gaily glow;
   The stars emit a kinder light
   Above the drifted snow.
   Down from the sky a magic steals
   To glad the passing year,
   And belfries sing with joyous peals,
   For Christmastide is here!

   1364030Collapsing CosmosesH. P. Lovecraft and R. H. Barlow1938

   Dam Bor glued each of his six eyes to the lenses of the cosmoscope. His
   nasal tentacles were orange with fear, and his antennae buzzed hoarsely
   as he dictated his report to the operator behind him. "It has come!" he
   cried. "That blur in the ether can be nothing less than a fleet from
   outside the space-time continuum we know. Nothing like this has ever
   appeared before. It must be an enemy. Give the alarm to the
   Inter-Cosmic Chamber of Commerce. There's no time to lose--at this rate
   they'll be upon us in less than six centuries. Hak Ni must have a
   chance to get the fleet in action at once." I glanced up from the Windy
   City Grab-Bag, which had beguiled my inactive peace-time days in the
   Super-Galactic Patrol. The handsome young vegetable, with whom I shared
   my bowl of caterpillar custard since earliest infancy, and with whom I
   had been thrown out of every joint in the intra-dimensional city of
   Kastor-Ya, had really a worried look upon his lavender face. After he
   had given the alarm we jumped on our ether-bikes and hastened across to
   the outer planet on which the Chamber held its sessions. Within the
   Great Council Chamber, which measured twenty-eight square feet (with
   quite a high ceiling), were gathered delegates from all the
   thirty-seven galaxies of our immediate universe. Oll Stof, President of
   the Chamber and representative of the Milliner's Soviet, raised his
   eyeless snout with dignity and prepared to address the assembled
   multitude. He was a highly developed protozoan organism from Nov-Kas,
   and spoke by emitting alternate waves of heat and cold. "Gentlemen," he
   radiated, "a terrible peril has come upon us which I feel I must bring
   to your attention." Everybody applauded riotously, as a wave of
   excitement rippled through the variegated audience; those who were
   handless slithering their tentacles together. He continued: "Hak Ni,
   crawl upon the dais!" There was a thunderous silence, during which a
   faint prompting was heard from the dizzy summit of the platform. Hak
   Ni, the yellow-furred and valorous commander of our ranks through
   numerous installments, ascended to the towering peak inches above the
   floor. "My friends--" he began, with an eloquent scraping of his
   posterior limbs, "these treasured walls and pillars shall not mourn on
   my account...." At this point, one of his numerous relatives cheered.
   "Well do I remember when..." Oll Stof interrupted him. "You have
   anticipated my thoughts and orders. Go forth and win for dear old
   Inter-Cosmic." Two paragraphs later found us soaring out past
   innumerable stars toward where a faint blur half a million light-years
   long marked the presence of the hated enemy, whom we had not seen. What
   monsters of malformed grotesqueness seethed out there among the moons
   of infinity, we really didn't know, but there was a malign menace in
   the glow that steadily increased until it spanned the entire heavens.
   Very soon we made out separate objects in the blur. Before all my
   horror-stricken vision-areas there spread an endless array of
   scissors-shaped space-ships of totally unfamiliar form. Then from the
   direction of the enemy there came a terrifying sound, which I soon
   recognised as a hail and a challenge. An answering thrill crept through
   me as I met with uplifted antennae this threat of battle with a
   monstrous intrusion upon our fair system from unknown outside abysses.
   At the sound, which was something like that of a rusty sewing-machine,
   only more horrible, Hak Ni too raised his snout in defiance, radiating
   a masterful order to the captains of the fleet. Instantly the huge
   space-ships swung into battle formation, with only a hundred or two of
   them many light-years out of line.

   Cool Air
   by H.P. Lovecraft

    Cool Air is a short story by the American horror fiction writer H. P.
   Lovecraft, written in March 1926 and published in the March 1928 issue
   of Tales of Magic and Mystery. -- Excerpted from Cool Air on Wikipedia,
                           the free encyclopedia.

   8394Cool AirH.P. Lovecraft

   You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I
   shiver more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated
   and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a
   mild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as others do
   to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will
   do is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and
   leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable
   explanation of my peculiarity.

   It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with
   darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of
   mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teeming
   midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady
   and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured
   some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York; and
   being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one cheap
   boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might
   combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and
   very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice
   between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West
   Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had
   sampled.

   The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently
   from the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose
   stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of
   tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with
   impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there
   lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the
   floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not
   too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a
   bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again. The
   landlady, a slatternly, almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did
   not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the late-burning
   electric light in my third-floor front hall room; and my fellow-lodgers
   were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly
   Spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade. Only the din
   of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance.

   I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident
   occurred. One evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor
   and became suddenly aware that I had been smelling the pungent odour of
   ammonia for some time. Looking about, I saw that the ceiling was wet
   and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the
   side toward the street. Anxious to stop the matter at its source, I
   hastened to the basement to tell the landlady; and was assured by her
   that the trouble would quickly be set right.

   "Doctair Muñoz," she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, "he have
   speel hees chemicals. He ees too seeck for doctair heemself--seecker
   and seecker all the time--but he weel not have no othair for help. He
   ees vairy queer in hees seeckness--all day he take funnee-smelling
   baths, and he cannot get excite or warm. All hees own housework he
   do--hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines, and he do not
   work as doctair. But he was great once--my fathair in Barcelona have
   hear of heem--and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get
   hurt of sudden. He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he
   breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals. My Gawd,
   the sal-ammoniac that man use for keep heem cool!"

   Mrs. Herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor, and I
   returned to my room. The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up
   what had spilled and opened the window for air, I heard the landlady's
   heavy footsteps above me. Dr. Muñoz I had never heard, save for certain
   sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was soft
   and gentle. I wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this
   man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not
   the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is, I reflected
   tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person
   who has come down in the world.

   I might never have known Dr. Muñoz had it not been for the heart attack
   that suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room.
   Physicians had told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew there
   was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said about
   the invalid's help of the injured workman, I dragged myself upstairs
   and knocked feebly at the door above mine. My knock was answered in
   good English by a curious voice some distance to the right, asking my
   name and business; and these things being stated, there came an opening
   of the door next to the one I had sought.

   A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the
   hottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a
   large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this
   nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its diurnal
   role of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings, old
   paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman's study
   rather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now saw that the hall room
   above mine--the "leetle room" of bottles and machines which Mrs.
   Herrero had mentioned--was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and
   that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose
   convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide
   all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Muñoz, most
   certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.

   The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad
   in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of
   masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short
   iron-grey full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full,
   dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to
   a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed
   hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully
   above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking
   intelligence and superior blood and breeding.

   Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Muñoz in that blast of cool air, I felt a
   repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly
   inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a
   physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been
   excusable considering the man's known invalidism. It might, too, have
   been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was
   abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion,
   distrust, and fear.

   But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange
   physician's extreme skill at once became manifest despite the
   ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly
   understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master's
   deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly
   hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies
   to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a
   lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and
   extirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in
   him, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and
   mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory
   room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty
   in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as
   memories of better days surged over him.

   His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even
   perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out.
   He sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his
   theories and experiments; and I remember his tactfully consoling me
   about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are
   stronger than organic life itself, so that if a bodily frame be but
   originally healthy and carefully preserved, it may through a scientific
   enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation
   despite the most serious impairments, defects, or even absences in the
   battery of specific organs. He might, he half jestingly said, some day
   teach me to live--or at least to possess some kind of conscious
   existence--without any heart at all! For his part, he was afflicted
   with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which
   included constant cold. Any marked rise in temperature might, if
   prolonged, affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his
   habitation--some 55 or 56 degrees Fahrenheit--was maintained by an
   absorption system of ammonia cooling, the gasoline engine of whose
   pumps I had often heard in my own room below.

   Relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, I left the
   shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse. After that
   I paid him frequent overcoated calls; listening while he told of secret
   researches and almost ghastly results, and trembling a bit when I
   examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his
   shelves. I was eventually, I may add, almost cured of my disease for
   all time by his skillful ministrations. It seems that he did not scorn
   the incantations of the mediaevalists, since he believed these cryptic
   formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably
   have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which
   organic pulsations had fled. I was touched by his account of the aged
   Dr. Torres of Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments and
   nursed him through the great illness of eighteen years before, whence
   his present disorders proceeded. No sooner had the venerable
   practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim
   enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great; for Dr.
   Muñoz made it whisperingly clear--though not in detail--that the
   methods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and
   processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens.

   As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was
   indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs.
   Herrero had suggested. The livid aspect of his countenance was
   intensified, his voice became more hollow and indistinct, his muscular
   motions were less perfectly coordinated, and his mind and will
   displayed less resilience and initiative. Of this sad change he seemed
   by no means unaware, and little by little his expression and
   conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me
   something of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt.

   He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices
   and Egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a
   sepulchred Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same time his demands
   for cold air increased, and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping
   of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating
   machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34 degrees or 40
   degrees, and finally even 28 degrees; the bathroom and laboratory, of
   course, being less chilled, in order that water might not freeze, and
   that chemical processes might not be impeded. The tenant adjoining him
   complained of the icy air from around the connecting door, so I helped
   him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty. A kind of growing
   horror, of outré and morbid cast, seemed to possess him. He talked of
   death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or
   funeral arrangements were gently suggested.

   All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet
   in my gratitude for his healing I could not well abandon him to the
   strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to
   his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially
   for the purpose. I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in
   bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and
   laboratory supply houses.

   An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around
   his apartment. The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odour; but
   the smell in his room was worse--and in spite of all the spices and
   incense, and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he
   insisted on taking unaided. I perceived that it must be connected with
   his ailment, and shuddered when I reflected on what that ailment might
   be. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him, and gave him
   up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son Esteban continue to run
   errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer would
   fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain. He
   evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will
   and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be
   confined to his bed. The lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place
   to a return of his fiery purpose, so that he seemed about to hurl
   defiance at the death-daemon even as that ancient enemy seized him. The
   pretence of eating, always curiously like a formality with him, he
   virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from
   total collapse.

   He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he
   carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that I transmit them after
   his death to certain persons whom he named--for the most part lettered
   East Indians, but including a once celebrated French physician now
   generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable things
   had been whispered. As it happened, I burned all these papers
   undelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice became utterly
   frightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an
   unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had
   come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed
   effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight. That man, oddly
   enough, had been through the terrors of the Great War without having
   incurred any fright so thorough.

   Then, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with
   stupefying suddenness. One night about eleven the pump of the
   refrigerating machine broke down, so that within three hours the
   process of ammonia cooling became impossible. Dr. Muñoz summoned me by
   thumping on the floor, and I worked desperately to repair the injury
   while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless, rattling hollowness
   surpassed description. My amateur efforts, however, proved of no use;
   and when I had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring all-night
   garage, we learned that nothing could be done till morning, when a new
   piston would have to be obtained. The moribund hermit's rage and fear,
   swelling to grotesque proportions, seemed likely to shatter what
   remained of his failing physique, and once a spasm caused him to clap
   his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom. He groped his way out
   with face tightly bandaged, and I never saw his eyes again.

   The frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and at
   about 5 a.m. the doctor retired to the bathroom, commanding me to keep
   him supplied with all the ice I could obtain at all-night drug stores
   and cafeterias. As I would return from my sometimes discouraging trips
   and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door, I could hear a
   restless splashing within, and a thick voice croaking out the order for
   "More--more!" At length a warm day broke, and the shops opened one by
   one. I asked Esteban either to help with the ice-fetching whilst I
   obtained the pump piston, or to order the piston while I continued with
   the ice; but instructed by his mother, he absolutely refused.

   Finally I hired a seedy-looking loafer whom I encountered on the corner
   of Eighth Avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little
   shop where I introduced him, and applied myself diligently to the task
   of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it.
   The task seemed interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the
   hermit when I saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round
   of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and
   thither by subway and surface car. About noon I encountered a suitable
   supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 p.m. arrived at my
   boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and
   intelligent mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time.

   Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil,
   and above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep
   basso. Fiendish things were in the air, and lodgers told over the beads
   of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctor's
   closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled screaming and
   mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result
   of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course, have locked the door
   behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the inside. There
   was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping.

   Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear
   that gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door;
   but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some
   wire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms
   on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses
   protected by handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south
   room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon.

   A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall
   door, and thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had
   accumulated. Something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful, blind
   hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws
   that traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the couch and
   ended unutterably.

   What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But
   this is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper
   before I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in
   terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that
   hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police
   station. The nauseous words seemed well-nigh incredible in that yellow
   sunlight, with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending
   clamorously from crowded Fourteenth Street, yet I confess that I
   believed them then. Whether I believe them now I honestly do not know.
   There are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all
   that I can say is that I hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a
   draught of unusually cool air.

   "The end," ran that noisome scrawl, "is here. No more ice--the man
   looked and ran away. Warmer every minute, and the tissues can't last. I
   fancy you know--what I said about the will and the nerves and the
   preserved body after the organs ceased to work. It was good theory, but
   couldn't keep up indefinitely. There was a gradual deterioration I had
   not foreseen. Dr. Torres knew, but the shock killed him. He couldn't
   stand what he had to do--he had to get me in a strange, dark place when
   he minded my letter and nursed me back. And the organs never would work
   again. It had to be done my way--artificial preservation--for you see I
   died that time eighteen years ago."

   Dagon
   by H.P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Wikipedia article, Data item.

   Dagon is a short story by H. P. Lovecraft, written in July 1917, one of
    the first stories he wrote as an adult. It was first published in the
     November 1919 edition of The Vagrant (issue #11). -- Excerpted from
          Dagon (short story) on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

   4165DagonH.P. Lovecraft

   I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight
   I shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug
   which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and
   shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street
   below. Do not think from my slavery to morphine that I am a weakling or
   a degenerate. When you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may
   guess, though never fully realise, why it is that I must have
   forgetfulness or death.
         It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the
   broad Pacific that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim
   to the German sea-raider. The great war was then at its very beginning,
   and the ocean forces of the Hun had not completely sunk to their later
   degradation; so that our vessel was made legitimate prize, whilst we of
   her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as
   naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors,
   that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small
   boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.
         When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little
   idea of my surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only
   guess vaguely by the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the
   equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coast-line
   was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for uncounted days I drifted
   aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for some passing
   ship, or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither
   ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the
   heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue.
         The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never
   know; for my slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was
   continuous. When at last I awaked, it was to discover myself half
   sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about
   me in monotonous undulations as far as I could see, and in which my
   boat lay grounded some distance away.
         Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of
   wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I
   was in reality more horrified than astonished; for there was in the air
   and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very
   core. The region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish, and of
   other less describable things which I saw protruding from the nasty mud
   of the unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope to convey in mere
   words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence
   and barren immensity. There was nothing within hearing, and nothing in
   sight save a vast reach of black slime; yet the very completeness of
   the stillness and homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a
   nauseating fear.
         The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost
   black in its cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh
   beneath my feet. As I crawled into the stranded boat I realised that
   only one theory could explain my position. Through some unprecedented
   volcanic upheaval, a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown
   to the surface, exposing regions which for innumerable millions of
   years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths. So great was
   the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, that I could not
   detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I
   might. Nor were there any sea-fowl to prey upon the dead things.
         For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which
   lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across
   the heavens. As the day progressed, the ground lost some of its
   stickiness, and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling
   purposes in a short time. That night I slept but little, and the next
   day I made for myself a pack containing food and water, preparatory to
   an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescue.
         On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon
   with ease. The odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much
   concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil, and set out
   boldly for an unknown goal. All day I forged steadily westward, guided
   by a far-away hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the
   rolling desert. That night I encamped, and on the following day still
   travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed scarcely nearer
   than when I had first espied it. By the fourth evening I attained the
   base of the mound which turned out to be much higher than it had
   appeared from a distance, an intervening valley setting it out in
   sharper relief from the general surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept
   in the shadow of the hill.
         I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the
   waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern
   plain, I was awake in a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more.
   Such visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again.
   And in the glow of the moon I saw how unwise I had been to travel by
   day. Without the glare of the parching sun, my journey would have cost
   me less energy; indeed, I now felt quite able to perform the ascent
   which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I started for the
   crest of the eminence.
         I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a
   source of vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I
   gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an
   immeasurable pit or canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet
   soard high enough to illuminate. I felt myself on the edge of the
   world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night.
   Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and of
   Satan's hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness.
         As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the
   slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined.
   Ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy foot-holds for a
   descent, whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet, the declivity
   became very gradual. Urged on by an impulse which I cannot definitely
   analyse, I scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the
   gentler slope beneath, gazing into the Stygian deeps where no light had
   yet penetrated.
         All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular
   object on the opposite slope, which rose steeply about an hundred yards
   ahead of me; an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays
   of the ascending moon. That it was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I
   soon assured myself; but I was conscious of a distinct impression that
   its contour and position were not altogether the work of Nature. A
   closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express; for despite
   its enormous magnitude, and its position in an abyss which had yawned
   at the bottom of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond
   a doubt that the strange object was a well-shaped monolith whose
   massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of
   living and thinking creatures.
         Dazed and frightened, yet not without a certain thrill of the
   scientist's or archaeologist's delight, I examined my surroundings more
   closely. The moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above
   the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact
   that a far-flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of
   sight in both directions, and almost lapping my feet as I stood on the
   slope. Across the chasm, the wavelets washed the base of the Cyclopean
   monolith; on whose surface I could now trace both inscriptions and
   crude sculptures. The writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown
   to me, and unlike anything I had ever seen in books; consisting for the
   most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels,
   octopi, crustaceans, molluscs, whales, and the like. Several characters
   obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern
   world, but whose decomposing forms I had observed on the ocean-risen
   plain.
         It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me
   spellbound. Plainly visible across the intervening water on account of
   their enormous size, were an array of bas-reliefs whose subjects would
   have excited the envy of Doré. I think that these things were supposed
   to depict men--at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures
   were shewn disporting like fishes in waters of some marine grotto, or
   paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the
   waves as well. Of their faces and forms I dare not speak in detail; for
   the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the
   imagination of a Poe or a Bulwer, they were damnably human in general
   outline despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips,
   glassy, bulging eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall.
   Curiously enough, they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of
   proportion with their scenic background; for one of the creatures was
   shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger
   than himself. I remarked, as I say, their grotesqueness and strange
   size, but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods
   of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some tribe whose last
   descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the Piltdown
   or Neanderthal Man was born. Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into
   a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist, I stood
   musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel
   before me.
         Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its
   rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters.
   Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous
   monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its
   gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent
   to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad then.
         Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious
   journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang
   a great deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have
   indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after I reached the
   boat; at any rate, I know that I heard peals of thunder and other tones
   which Nature utters only in her wildest moods.
         When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital;
   brought thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up
   my boat in mid-ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my
   words had been given scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the
   Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing; nor did I deem it necessary to
   insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought
   out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions
   regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-God; but
   soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my
   inquiries.
         It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning,
   that I see the thing. I tried morphine; but the drug has given only
   transient surcease, and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless
   slave. So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the
   information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellow-men. Often I ask
   myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm--a mere freak of
   fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape
   from the German man-of-war. This I ask myself, but ever does there come
   before me a hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the deep
   sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very
   moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their
   ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on
   submarine obelisks of water-soaked granite. I dream of a day when they
   may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the
   remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankind--of a day when the land shall
   sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal
   pandemonium.
         The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense
   slippery body lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God, that
   hand! The window! The window!

   Despair
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   February 1919
   9413DespairH. P. Lovecraft

   O'er the midnight moorlands crying,
   Thro' the cypress forests sighing,
   In the night-wind madly flying,
        Hellish forms with streaming hair;
   In the barren branches creaking,
   By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,
   Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking,
        Damn'd demons of despair.
   Once, I think I half remember,
   Ere the grey skies of November
   Quench'd my youth's aspiring ember,
        Liv'd there such a thing as bliss;
   Skies that now are dark were beaming,
   Bold and azure, splendid seeming
   Till I learn'd it all was dreaming --
        Deadly drowsiness of Dis.
   But the stream of Time, swift flowing,
   Brings the torment of half-knowing --
   Dimly rushing, blindly going
        Past the never-trodden lea;
   And the voyager, repining,
   Sees the wicked death-fires shining,
   Hears the wicked petrel's whining
        As he helpless drifts to sea.
   Evil wings in ether beating;
   Vultures at the spirit eating;
   Things unseen forever fleeting
        Black against the leering sky.
   Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,
   Clawing fiends of future sadness,
   Mingle in a cloud of madness
        Ever on the soul to lie.
   Thus the living, lone and sobbing,
   In the throes of anguish throbbing,
   With the loathsome Furies robbing
        Night and noon of peace and rest.
   But beyond the groans and grating
   Of abhorrent Life, is waiting
   Sweet Oblivion, culminating
        All the years of fruitless quest.

   Ex Oblivione  (1921)

   8400Ex OblivioneH. P. Lovecraft1921

   When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence
   began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that
   torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body, I
   loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of
   the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old
   gardens and enchanted woods.

   Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and
   sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.

   Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless
   stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight,
   iridescent arbours, and undying roses.

   And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves
   and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and
   pierced by a little gate of bronze.

   Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I
   pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and
   twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to
   trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples.
   And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with
   the little gate of bronze therein.

   After awhile, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from
   their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace
   through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize
   them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back
   to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked
   upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a
   dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no
   return.

   So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in
   the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I
   would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting
   merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.

   Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus
   filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city,
   and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were
   written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was
   lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high
   wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that
   it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in
   the yellowed papyrus.

   Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the
   irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew
   not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into
   the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no
   new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the
   commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate
   and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.

   Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden
   valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique
   wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a
   glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the
   buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of
   the land from whence I should never return.

   But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream
   pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end;
   for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void
   of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared
   hope to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal
   oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and
   desolate hour.

   Fact and Fancy  (1917)
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   Published February 1917.
   9414Fact and FancyH. P. Lovecraft1917

   How dull the wretch, whose philosophic mind
   Disdains the pleasures of fantastic kind;
   Whose prosy thoughts the joys of life exclude,
   And wreck the solace of the poet's mood!
   Young Zeno, practis'd in the Stoic's art,
   Rejects the language of the glowing heart;
   Dissolves sweet Nature to a mess of laws;
   Condemns th' effect whilst looking for the cause;
   Freezes poor Ovid in an iced review,
   And sneers because his fables are untrue!
   In search of hope the hopeful zealot goes,
   But all the sadder tums, the more he knows!
   Stay! Vandal sophist, whose deep lore would blast
   The grateful legends of the storied past;
   Whose tongue in censure flays th' embellish'd page,
   And scorns the comforts of a dreary age:
   Wouldst strip the foliage from the vital bough
   Till all men grow as wisely dull as thou?
   Happy the man whose fresh, untainted eye
   Discerns a Pantheon in the spangled sky;
   Finds sylphs and dryads in the waving trees,
   And spies soft Notus in the southern breeze
   For whom the stream a cheering carol sings,
   While reedy music by the fountain rings;
   To whom the waves a Nereid tale confide
   Till friendly presence fills the rising tide.
   Happy is he, who void of learning's woes,
   Th' ethereal life of bodied Nature knows;
   I scorn the sage that tells me it but seems,
   And flout his gravity in sunlight dreams!

   8401Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His FamilyH. P.
   Lovecraft

I[edit]

   Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of
   it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a
   thousandfold more hideous. Science, already oppressive with its
   shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our
   human species--if separate species we be--for its reserve of unguessed
   horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world.
   If we knew what we are, we should do as Sir Arthur Jermyn did; and
   Arthur Jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one
   night. No one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial
   to him who had been; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were
   found which made men wish to forget. Some who knew him do not admit
   that he ever existed.

   Arthur Jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the
   boxed object which had come from Africa. It was this object, and not
   his peculiar personal appearance, which made him end his life. Many
   would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of
   Arthur Jermyn, but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded.
   Learning was in his blood, for his great-grandfather, Sir Robert
   Jermyn, Bt., had been an anthropologist of note, whilst his
   great-great-great-grandfather, Sir Wade Jermyn, was one of the earliest
   explorers of the Congo region, and had written eruditely of its tribes,
   animals, and supposed antiquities. Indeed, old Sir Wade had possessed
   an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania; his bizarre
   conjectures on a prehistoric white Congolese civilisation earning him
   much ridicule when his book, Observation on the Several Parts of
   Africa, was published. In 1765 this fearless explorer had been placed
   in a madhouse at Huntingdon.

   Madness was in all the Jermyns, and people were glad there were not
   many of them. The line put forth no branches, and Arthur was the last
   of it. If he had not been, one can not say what he would have done when
   the object came. The Jermyns never seemed to look quite
   right--something was amiss, though Arthur was the worst, and the old
   family portraits in Jermyn House showed fine faces enough before Sir
   Wade's time. Certainly, the madness began with Sir Wade, whose wild
   stories of Africa were at once the delight and terror of his few
   friends. It showed in his collection of trophies and specimens, which
   were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve, and
   appeared strikingly in the Oriental seclusion in which he kept his
   wife. The latter, he had said, was the daughter of a Portuguese trader
   whom he had met in Africa; and did not like English ways. She, with an
   infant son born in Africa, had accompanied him back from the second and
   longest of his trips, and had gone with him on the third and last,
   never returning. No one had ever seen her closely, not even the
   servants; for her disposition had been violent and singular. During her
   brief stay at Jermyn House she occupied a remote wing, and was waited
   on by her husband alone. Sir Wade was, indeed, most peculiar in his
   solicitude for his family; for when he returned to Africa he would
   permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman
   from Guinea. Upon coming back, after the death of Lady Jermyn, he
   himself assumed complete care of the boy.

   But it was the talk of Sir Wade, especially when in his cups, which
   chiefly led his friends to deem him mad. In a rational age like the
   eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about
   wild sights and strange scenes under a Congo moon; of the gigantic
   walls and pillars of a forgotten city, crumbling and vine-grown, and of
   damp, silent, stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness
   of abysmal treasure-vaults and inconceivable catacombs. Especially was
   it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place;
   of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged
   city--fabulous creatures which even a Pliny might describe with
   scepticism; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had
   overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars, the vaults and
   the weird carvings. Yet after he came home for the last time Sir Wade
   would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest, mostly
   after his third glass at the Knight's Head; boasting of what he had
   found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known
   only to him. And finally he had spoken of the living things in such a
   manner that he was taken to the madhouse. He had shown little regret
   when shut into the barred room at Huntingdon, for his mind moved
   curiously. Ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy, he
   had liked his home less and less, till at last he had seemed to dread
   it. The Knight's Head had been his headquarters, and when he was
   confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection. Three
   years later he died.

   Wade Jermyn's son Philip was a highly peculiar person. Despite a strong
   physical resemblance to his father, his appearance and conduct were in
   many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned. Though he
   did not inherit the madness which was feared by some, he was densely
   stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence. In frame
   he was small, but intensely powerful, and was of incredible agility.
   Twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of
   his gamekeeper, a person said to be of gypsy extraction, but before his
   son was born joined the navy as a common sailor, completing the general
   disgust which his habits and misalliance had begun. After the close of
   the American war he was heard of as sailor on a merchantman in the
   African trade, having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and
   climbing, but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the
   Congo coast.

   In the son of Sir Philip Jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity
   took a strange and fatal turn. Tall and fairly handsome, with a sort of
   weird Eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion,
   Robert Jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator. It was he who
   first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his
   mad grandfather had brought from Africa, and who made the family name
   as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration. In 1815 Sir Robert
   married a daughter of the seventh Viscount Brightholme and was
   subsequently blessed with three children, the eldest and youngest of
   whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and
   body. Saddened by these family misfortunes, the scientist sought relief
   in work, and made two long expeditions in the interior of Africa. In
   1849 his second son, Nevil, a singularly repellent person who seemed to
   combine the surliness of Philip Jermyn with the hauteur of the
   Brightholmes, ran away with a vulgar dancer, but was pardoned upon his
   return in the following year. He came back to Jermyn House a widower
   with an infant son, Alfred, who was one day to be the father of Arthur
   Jermyn.

   Friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind
   of Sir Robert Jermyn, yet it was probably merely a bit of African
   folklore which caused the disaster. The elderly scholar had been
   collecting legends of the Onga tribes near the field of his
   grandfather's and his own explorations, hoping in some way to account
   for Sir Wade's wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid
   creatures. A certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor
   suggested that the madman's imagination might have been stimulated by
   native myths. On October 19, 1852, the explorer Samuel Seaton called at
   Jermyn House with a manuscript of notes collected among the Ongas,
   believing that certain legends of a gray city of white apes ruled by a
   white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist. In his conversation
   he probably supplied many additional details; the nature of which will
   never be known, since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into
   being. When Sir Robert Jermyn emerged from his library he left behind
   the strangled corpse of the explorer, and before he could be
   restrained, had put an end to all three of his children; the two who
   were never seen, and the son who had run away. Nevil Jermyn died in the
   successful defence of his own two-year-old son, who had apparently been
   included in the old man's madly murderous scheme. Sir Robert himself,
   after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter an
   articulate sound, died of apoplexy in the second year of his
   confinement.

   Sir Alfred Jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday, but his
   tastes never matched his title. At twenty he had joined a band of
   music-hall performers, and at thirty-six had deserted his wife and
   child to travel with an itinerant American circus. His end was very
   revolting. Among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled
   was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a
   surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers.
   With this gorilla Alfred Jermyn was singularly fascinated, and on many
   occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the
   intervening bars. Eventually Jermyn asked and obtained permission to
   train the animal, astonishing audiences and fellow performers alike
   with his success. One morning in Chicago, as the gorilla and Alfred
   Jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match, the former
   delivered a blow of more than the usual force, hurting both the body
   and the dignity of the amateur trainer. Of what followed, members of
   "The Greatest Show On Earth" do not like to speak. They did not expect
   to hear Sir Alfred Jermyn emit a shrill, inhuman scream, or to see him
   seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands, dash it to the floor of
   the cage, and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat. The gorilla was off
   its guard, but not for long, and before anything could be done by the
   regular trainer, the body which had belonged to a baronet was past
   recognition.

II[edit]

   Arthur Jermyn was the son of Sir Alfred Jermyn and a music-hall singer
   of unknown origin. When the husband and father deserted his family, the
   mother took the child to Jermyn House; where there was none left to
   object to her presence. She was not without notions of what a
   nobleman's dignity should be, and saw to it that her son received the
   best education which limited money could provide. The family resources
   were now sadly slender, and Jermyn House had fallen into woeful
   disrepair, but young Arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents.
   He was not like any other Jermyn who had ever lived, for he was a poet
   and a dreamer. Some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of
   old Sir Wade Jermyn's unseen Portuguese wife declared that her Latin
   blood must be showing itself; but most persons merely sneered at his
   sensitiveness to beauty, attributing it to his music-hall mother, who
   was socially unrecognised. The poetic delicacy of Arthur Jermyn was the
   more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance. Most of the
   Jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast, but Arthur's
   case was very striking. It is hard to say just what he resembled, but
   his expression, his facial angle, and the length of his arms gave a
   thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time.

   It was the mind and character of Arthur Jermyn which atoned for his
   aspect. Gifted and learned, he took highest honours at Oxford and
   seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family. Though of
   poetic rather than scientific temperament, he planned to continue the
   work of his forefathers in African ethnology and antiquities, utilising
   the truly wonderful though strange collection of Sir Wade. With his
   fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which
   the mad explorer had so implicitly believed, and would weave tale after
   tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter's wilder
   notes and paragraphs. For the nebulous utterances concerning a
   nameless, unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling
   of mingled terror and attraction, speculating on the possible basis of
   such a fancy, and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data
   gleaned by his great-grandfather and Samuel Seaton amongst the Ongas.

   In 1911, after the death of his mother, Sir Arthur Jermyn determined to
   pursue his investigations to the utmost extent. Selling a portion of
   his estate to obtain the requisite money, he outfitted an expedition
   and sailed for the Congo. Arranging with the Belgian authorities for a
   party of guides, he spent a year in the Onga and Kahn country, finding
   data beyond the highest of his expectations. Among the Kaliris was an
   aged chief called Mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive
   memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old
   legends. This ancient confirmed every tale which Jermyn had heard,
   adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had
   been told to him.

   According to Mwanu, the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no
   more, having been annihilated by the warlike N'bangus many years ago.
   This tribe, after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live
   beings, had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object
   of their quest; the white ape-goddess which the strange beings
   worshipped, and which was held by Congo tradition to be the form of one
   who had reigned as a princess among these beings. Just what the white
   apelike creatures could have been, Mwanu had no idea, but he thought
   they were the builders of the ruined city. Jermyn could form no
   conjecture, but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend
   of the stuffed goddess.

   The ape-princess, it was said, became the consort of a great white god
   who had come out of the West. For a long time they had reigned over the
   city together, but when they had a son, all three went away. Later the
   god and princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her
   divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house
   of stone, where it was worshipped. Then he departed alone. The legend
   here seemed to present three variants. According to one story, nothing
   further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of
   supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it. It was for this reason
   that the N'bangus carried it off. A second story told of a god's return
   and death at the feet of his enshrined wife. A third told of the return
   of the son, grown to manhood--or apehood or godhood, as the case might
   be--yet unconscious of his identity. Surely the imaginative blacks had
   made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant
   legendry.

   Of the reality of the jungle city described by old Sir Wade, Arthur
   Jermyn had no further doubt; and was hardly astonished when early in
   1912 he came upon what was left of it. Its size must have been
   exaggerated, yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere
   Negro village. Unfortunately no carvings could be found, and the small
   size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one
   visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults
   which Sir Wade had mentioned. The white apes and the stuffed goddess
   were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region, but it
   remained for a European to improve on the data offered by old Mwanu. M.
   Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading-post on the Congo, believed that
   he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of which he
   had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N'bangus were now the
   submissive servants of King Albert's government, and with but little
   persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had
   carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the
   exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a
   priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his
   great-great-great-grandfather's narratives--that is, the wildest which
   he had ever heard. Countrymen near Jermyn House had perhaps heard
   wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to Sir Wade
   around the tables of the Knight's Head.

   Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M.
   Verhaeren, meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts
   left by his mad ancestor. He began to feel closely akin to Sir Wade,
   and to seek relics of the latter's personal life in England as well as
   of his African exploits. Oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded
   wife had been numerous, but no tangible relic of her stay at Jermyn
   House remained. Jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or
   permitted such an effacement, and decided that the husband's insanity
   was the prime cause. His great-great-great-grandmother, he recalled,
   was said to have been the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. No
   doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the Dark
   Continent had caused her to flout Sir Wade's tales of the interior, a
   thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive. She had died in
   Africa, perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what
   he had told. But as Jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not
   but smile at their futility, a century and a half after the death of
   both his strange progenitors.

   In June, 1913, a letter arrived from M. Verhaeren, telling of the
   finding of the stuffed goddess. It was, the Belgian averred, a most
   extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to
   classify. Whether it was human or simian only a scientist could
   determine, and the process of determination would be greatly hampered
   by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo climate are not kind to
   mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed
   to be the case here. Around the creature's neck had been found a golden
   chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt
   some hapless traveller's keepsake, taken by the N'bangus and hung upon
   the goddess as a charm. In commenting on the contour of the mummy's
   face, M. Verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison; or rather,
   expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his corespondent,
   but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in
   levity. The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive duly packed about a
   month after receipt of the letter.

   The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of
   August 3, 1913, being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which
   housed the collection of African specimens as arranged by Sir Robert
   and Arthur. What ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants
   and from things and papers later examined. Of the various tales, that
   of aged Soames, the family butler, is most ample and coherent.
   According to this trustworthy man, Sir Arthur Jermyn dismissed everyone
   from the room before opening the box, though the instant sound of
   hammer and chisel showed that he did not delay the operation. Nothing
   was heard for some time; just how long Soames cannot exactly estimate,
   but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the
   horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn's voice, was heard. Immediately
   afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing frantically toward the
   front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy. The expression
   on his face, a face ghastly enough in repose, was beyond description.
   When near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned
   back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar.
   The servants were utterly dumbfounded, and watched at the head of the
   stairs, but their master did not return. A smell of oil was all that
   came up from the regions below. After dark a rattling was heard at the
   door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a stable-boy saw
   Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of
   that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor
   surrounding the house. Then, in an exaltation of supreme horror,
   everyone saw the end. A spark appeared on the moor, a flame arose, and
   a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens. The house of Jermyn no
   longer existed.

   The reason why Arthur Jermyn's charred fragments were not collected and
   buried lies in what was found afterward, principally the thing in the
   box. The stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight, withered and eaten away,
   but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species, less
   hairy than any recorded variety, and infinitely nearer mankind--quite
   shockingly so. Detailed description would be rather unpleasant, but two
   salient particulars must be told, for they fit in revoltingly with
   certain notes of Sir Wade Jermyn's African expeditions and with the
   Congolese legends of the white god and the ape-princess. The two
   particulars in question are these: the arms on the golden locket about
   the creature's neck were the Jermyn arms, and the jocose suggestion of
   M. Verhaeren about certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled
   face applied with vivid, ghastly, and unnatural horror to none other
   than the sensitive Arthur Jermyn, great-great-great-grandson of Sir
   Wade Jermyn and an unknown wife. Members of the Royal Anthropological
   Institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well, and some
   of them do not admit that Arthur Jermyn ever existed.

   Festival
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   Published December 1926 in Weird Tales.
   12047FestivalH. P. Lovecraft

   There is snow on the ground,
     And the valleys are cold,
   And a midnight profound
    Blackly squats o'er the wold;
   But a light on the hilltops half-seen hints of
     feastings unhallowed and old.

   There is death in the clouds,
     There is fear in the night,
   For the dead in their shrouds
     Hail the sun's turning flight.
   And chant wild in the woods as they dance
     round a Yule-altar fungous and white.

   To no gale of Earth's kind
     Sways the forest of oak,
   Where the thick boughs entwined
     By mad mistletoes choke,
   For these pow'rs are the pow'rs of the dark,
     from the graves of the lost Druid-folk.

   And mayst thou to such deeds
     Be an abbot and priest,
   Singing cannibal greeds
     At each devil-wrought feast,
   And to all the incredulous world
     shewing dimly the sign of the beast.

   Four O'Clock  (1922)
   by Sonia H. Greene
   1345510Four O'ClockSonia H. Greene1922

   About two in the morning I knew it was coming. The great black silences
   of night's depth told me, and a monstrous cricket, chirping with a
   persistence too hideous to be unmeaning, made it certain. It is to be
   at four o'clock -- at four in the dusk before dawn, just as he said it
   would be. I had not fully believed it previously, because the
   prophecies of vindictive madmen are seldom to be taken with
   seriousness. Besides, I was not justly to be blamed for what had
   befallen him at four o'clock on that other morning; that terrible
   morning whose memory will never leave me. And when, at length, he had
   died and was buried in the ancient cemetery just across the road from
   my east windows, I was certain that his curse could not harm me. Had I
   not seen his lifeless clay securely pinned down by huge shovelfuls of
   mould? Might I not feel assured that his crumbling bones would be
   powerless to bring me the doom at a day and an hour so precisely
   stated? Such, indeed, had been my thoughts until this shocking night
   itself; this night of incredible chaos, of shattered certainties, and
   of nameless portents.

   I had retired early, hoping fatuously to snatch a few hours of sleep
   despite the prophecy which haunted me. Now that the time was so close
   at hand, I found it harder and harder to dismiss the vague fears which
   had always lain beneath my conscious thoughts. As the cooling sheets
   soothed my fevered body, I could find nothing to soothe my still more
   fevered mind; but lay tossing and uneasily awake, trying first one
   position and then another in a desperate effort to banish with slumber
   that one damnably insistent notion -- that it is to occur at four
   o'clock.

   Was this frightful unrest due to my surroundings; to the fateful
   locality in which I was sojourning after so many years? Why, I now
   asked myself bitterly, had I permitted circumstance to place me on this
   night of all nights, in that well-remembered house and that
   well-remembered room whose east windows overlook the lonely road and
   the ancient country cemetery beyond? In my mind's eye every detail of
   that unpretentious necropolis rose before me - its white fence, its
   ghost-like granite shafts, and the hovering auras of those on whom the
   worms fed. Finally the force of the conception led my vision to depths
   more remote and more forbidden, and I saw under the neglected grass the
   silent shapes of the things from which the auras came - the calm
   sleepers, the rotting things, the things which had twisted frantically
   in their coffins before sleep came, and the peaceful bones in every
   stage of disintegration from the complete and coherent skeleton to the
   huddled handful of dust. Most of all I envied the dust. Then new terror
   came as my fancy encountered his grave. Into that sepulcher I dared not
   let my thought stray, and I should have screamed had not something
   forestalled the malign power that pulled my mental sight. That
   something was a sudden gust of wind, sprung from nowhere amidst the
   calm night, which unfastened the shutter of the nearest window,
   throwing it back with a shivery slam and uncovering to my actual waking
   glance the antique cemetery itself, brooding spectrally beneath an
   early morning moon.

   I speak of this gust as something merciful, yet know now that it was
   only transiently and mockingly so. For no sooner had my eyes compassed
   the moonlight scene than I became aware of a fresh omen, this time too
   unmistakable to be classed as an empty phantasm, which arose from among
   the gleaming tombs across the road. Having glanced with instinctive
   apprehension toward the spot where he lay mouldering -- a spot cut off
   from my gaze by the window-frame -- I perceived with trepidation the
   approach of an indescribable something which flowed menacingly from
   that very direction ; a vague, vaporous, formless mass of greyish-
   white substance or spirit, dull and tenuous as yet, but every moment
   increasing in awesome and cataclysmic potentiality. Try as I might to
   dismiss it as a natural meteorological phenomenon, its fearsomely
   portentous and deliberate character grew upon me amidst new thrills of
   horror and apprehension; so that I was scarcely unprepared for the
   definitely purposeful and malevolent culmination which soon occurred.
   That culmination, bringing with it a hideous symbolic foreshadowing of
   the end, was equally simple and threatening. The vapor each moment
   thickened and piled up, assuming at last a half tangible aspect; while
   the surface toward me gradually became circular in outline, and
   markedly concave; as it slowly ceased its advance and stood spectrally
   at the end of the road. And as it stood there, faintly quivering in the
   damp night air under that unwholesome moon, I saw that its aspect was
   that of the pallid and gigantic dial of a distorted clock.

   Hideous events now followed in demoniac succession. There took shape in
   the lower right-hand part of the vaporous dial a black and formidable
   creature, shapeless and only half seen, yet having four prominent claws
   which reached out greedily at me - claws redolent of noxious fatality
   in their very contour and location; since they formed too plainly the
   dreaded outlines, and filled too unmistakably the exact position, of
   the numeral IV on the quivering dial of doom. Presently the monstrosity
   stepped or wriggled out of the concave surface of the dial, and began
   to approach me by some unexplained kind of locomotion. The four talons,
   long, thin, and straight, were now seen to be tipped by disgusting,
   thread-like tentacles, each with a vile intelligence of its own, which
   groped about incessantly, slowly at first, but gradually increasing in
   velocity until I was nearly driven mad by the sheer dizziness of their
   motion. And as a crowning horror I began to hear all the subtle and
   cryptical noises that pierced the intensified night silence; a
   thousand-fold magnified, and in one voice reminding me of the abhorred
   hour of four. In vain I tried to pull up the coverlet to shut them out;
   in vain I tried to drown them with my screams. I was mute and
   paralyzed, yet agonizingly aware of every unnatural sight and sound in
   that devastating, moon-cursed stillness. Once I managed to get my head
   beneath the covers -- once when the cricket's shrieking of that hideous
   phrase, four-o'clock, seemed about to shatter my brain -- but that only
   aggravated the terror, making the roars of that detestable creature
   strike me like the blows of a titanic sledgehammer.

   And now, as I withdrew my tortured head from its fruitless protection,
   I found augmented diabolism to harass my eyes. Upon the newly painted
   wall of my apartment, as if called forth by the tentacled monster from
   the tomb, there danced mockingly before me a myriad company of beings,
   black, grey, and white, such as only the fancy of the god-stricken
   might visualize. Some were of infinitesimal smallness; others covered
   vast areas. In minor details each had a grotesque and horrible
   individuality, in general outlines they all conformed to the same
   nightmare pattern despite their vastly varied size. Again I tried to
   shut out the abnormalities of the night, but vainly as before. The
   dancing things on the wall waxed and waned in magnitude, approaching
   and receding as they trod their morbid and menacing measure. And the
   aspect of each was that of some demon clock-face with one sinister hour
   always figured thereon - the dreaded, the doom-delivering hour of four.

   Baffled in every attempt to shake off the circling and relentless
   delirium, I glanced once more toward the unshuttered window and beheld
   again the monster which had come from the grave. Horrible it had been
   before; indescribable it had now become. The creature, formerly of
   indeterminate substance, was now formed of red and malignant fire; and
   waved repulsively its four tentacled claws - unspeakable tongues of
   living flame. It stared and stared at me out of the blackness;
   sneeringly, mockingly; now advancing, now retiring. Then, in the
   tenebrous silence, those four writhing talons of fire beckoned
   invitingly to their demoniacally dancing counterparts on the walls, and
   seemed to beat time rhythmically to the shocking saraband till the
   world was one ghoulishly gyrating vortex of leaping, prancing, gliding,
   leering, taunting, threatening four o'clocks.

   Somewhere, beginning afar off and advancing slowly over the sphinx like
   sea and the febrile marshes, I heard the early morning wind come
   soughing; faintly at first, then louder and louder until its unceasing
   burden flowed as a deluge of whirring, buzzing cacophony bringing
   always the hideous threat, `four o'clock, four o'clock, FOUR O'CLOCK.'
   monotonously it grew from a whimper to a deafening roar, as of a giant
   cataract, but finally reached a climax and began to subside. As it
   receded into the distance it left upon my sensitive ears such a
   vibration as is left by the passing of a swift and ponderous railway
   train; this, and a stark dread whose intensity gave it something of the
   tranquility of resignation.

   The end is near. All sound and vision have become one vast chaotic
   maelstrom of lethal, clamorous menace, wherein are fused all the
   ghastly and unhallowed four o'clocks which have existed since
   immemorial time began, and all which will exist in eternities to come.
   The flaming monster is advancing closely now, its charnel tentacles
   brushing my face and its talons curving hungrily as they grope toward
   my throat. At last I can see its face through the churning and
   phosphorescent vapors of the graveyard air, and with devastating pangs
   I realize that it is in essence an awful, colossal, gargoyle-like
   caricature of his face -- the face of him from whose uneasy grave it
   has issued. Now I know that my doom is indeed sealed; that the wild
   threats of the madman were in truth the demon maledictions of a potent
   fiend, and that my innocence will prove no protection against the
   malign volition which craves a causeless vengeance. He is determined to
   pay me with interest for what he suffered at that spectral hour;
   determined to drag me out of the world into realms which only the mad
   and the devil-ridden know.

   And as amidst the seething of hell's flames and the tumult of the
   damned those fiery claws point murderously at my throat, I hear upon
   the mantel the faint whirring sound of a timepiece; the whirring which
   tells me that it is about to strike the hour whose name now flows
   incessantly from the death-like and cavernous throat of the rattling,
   jeering, croaking grave-monster before me -- the accursed, the infernal
   hour of four o'clock.

   Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my
   best friend, Crawford Tillinghast. I had not seen him since that day,
   two months and a half before, when he told me toward what goal his
   physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered
   my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his
   laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage. I had known that
   he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed
   electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but
   I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and
   disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a stout man
   suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes
   yellowed or grayed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing,
   the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and
   twitching. And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness, a
   wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots,
   and an unchecked growth of white beard on a face once clean-shaven, the
   cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of
   Crawford Tilllinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me
   to his door after my weeks of exile; such was the specter that trembled
   as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its
   shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house
   set back from Benevolent Street.

   That Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and
   philosophy was a mistake. These things should be left to the frigid and
   impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives
   to the man of feeling and action; despair, if he fail in his quest, and
   terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed. Tillinghast had
   once been the prey of failure, solitary and melancholy; but now I knew,
   with nauseating fears of my own, that he was the prey of success. I had
   indeed warned him ten weeks before, when he burst forth with his tale
   of what he felt himself about to discover. He had been flushed and
   excited then, talking in a high and unnatural, though always pedantic,
   voice.

   "What do we know," he had said, "of the world and the universe about
   us? Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our
   notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as
   we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute
   nature. With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the
   boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with wider, stronger, or
   different range of senses might not only see very differently the
   things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy,
   and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the
   senses we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible
   worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way
   to break down the barriers. I am not joking. Within twenty-four hours
   that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized
   sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges.
   Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several
   unknown to anything we consider organic life. We shall see that at
   which dogs howl in the dark, and that at which cats prick up their ears
   after midnight. We shall see these things, and other things which no
   breathing creature has yet seen. We shall overleap time, space, and
   dimensions, and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation."

   When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well
   enough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic, and
   drove me from the house. Now he was no less a fanatic, but his desire
   to speak had conquered his resentment, and he had written me
   imperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognize. As I entered the
   abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle,
   I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the
   shadows. The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied
   forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light, and I
   sickened at the hollow, altered voice of my host. I wished the servants
   were about, and did not like it when he said they had all left three
   days previously. It seemed strange that old Gregory, at least, should
   desert his master without telling as tried a friend as I. It was he who
   had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was
   repulsed in rage.

   Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and
   fascination. Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could
   only guess, but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to
   impart, I could not doubt. Before I had protested at his unnatural
   pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to
   some degree I almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of
   victory appeared. Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed
   the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody of man. The
   electricity seemed to be turned off, and when I asked my guide he said
   it was for a definite reason.

   "It would be too much... I would not dare," he continued to mutter. I
   especially noted his new habit of muttering, for it was not like him to
   talk to himself. We entered the laboratory in the attic, and I observed
   that detestable electrical machine, glowing with a sickly, sinister
   violet luminosity. It was connected with a powerful chemical battery,
   but seemed to be receiving no current; for I recalled that in its
   experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action. In reply
   to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not
   electrical in any sense that I could understand.

   He now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and
   turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs.
   The usual sputtering began, turned to a whine, and terminated in a
   drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence. Meanwhile the
   luminosity increased, waned again, then assumed a pale, outrè colour or
   blend of colours which I could neither place nor describe. Tillinghast
   had been watching me, and noted my puzzled expression.

   "Do you know what that is?" he whispered, "That is ultra-violet." He
   chuckled oddly at my surprise. "You thought ultra-violet was invisible,
   and so it is - but you can see that and many other invisible things
   now.

   "Listen to me! The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping
   senses in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the
   state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity. I have
   seen the truth, and I intend to show it to you. Do you wonder how it
   will seem? I will tell you." Here Tillinghast seated himself directly
   opposite me, blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes.
   "Your existing sense-organs - ears first, I think - will pick up many
   of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant
   organs. Then there will be others. You have heard of the pineal gland?
   I laugh at the shallow endocrinologist, fellow-dupe and fellow-parvenu
   of the Freudian. That gland is the great sense organ of organs - I have
   found out. It is like sight in the end, and transmits visual pictures
   to the brain. If you are normal, that is the way you ought to get most
   of it... I mean get most of the evidence from beyond."

   I looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall,
   dimly lit by rays which the every day eye cannot see. The far corners
   were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which
   obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and
   phantasm. During the interval that Tillinghast was long silent I
   fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of long-dead gods; some
   vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a
   floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision.
   The picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a
   more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite,
   sightless, soundless space. There seemed to be a void, and nothing
   more, and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip
   pocket the revolver I carried after dark since the night I was held up
   in East Providence. Then from the farthermost regions of remoteness,
   the sound softly glided into existence. It was infinitely faint, subtly
   vibrant, and unmistakably musical, but held a quality of surpassing
   wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole
   body. I felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally
   scratching ground glass. Simultaneously there developed something like
   a cold draught, which apparently swept past me from the direction of
   the distant sound. As I waited breathlessly I perceived that both sound
   and wind were increasing; the effect being to give me an odd notion of
   myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching
   locomotive. I began to speak to Tillinghast, and as I did so all the
   unusual impressions abruptly vanished. I saw only the man, the glowing
   machines, and the dim apartment. Tillinghast was grinning repulsively
   at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his
   expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much as I, if not a
   great deal more. I whispered what I had experienced and he bade me to
   remain as quiet and receptive as possible.

   "Don't move," he cautioned, "for in these rays we are able to be seen
   as well as to see. I told you the servants left, but I didn't tell you
   how. It was that thick-witted house-keeper - she turned on the lights
   downstairs after I had warned her not to, and the wires picked up
   sympathetic vibrations. It must have been frightful - I could hear the
   screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another
   direction, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of
   clothes around the house. Mrs. Updike's clothes were close to the front
   hall switch - that's how I know she did it. It got them all. But so
   long as we don't move we're fairly safe. Remember we're dealing with a
   hideous world in which we are practically helpless... Keep still!"

   The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me
   a kind of paralysis, and in my terror my mind again opened to the
   impressions coming from what Tillinghast called "beyond." I was now in
   a vortex of sound and motion, with confused pictures before my eyes. I
   saw the blurred outlines of the room, but from some point in space
   there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes
   or clouds, penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right
   of me. Then I glimpsed the temple - like effect again, but this time
   the pillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light, which sent down
   one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen
   before. After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in
   the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense-impressions I felt
   that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form. One
   definite flash I shall always remember. I seemed for an instant to
   behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining, revolving
   spheres, and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a
   constellation or galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the
   distorted face of Crawford Tillinghast. At another time I felt the huge
   animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting
   through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at
   them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually. I
   recalled what he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw
   with this preternatural eye.

   Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over
   and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though
   vague, held the elements of consistency and permanence. It was indeed
   somewhat familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual
   terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted
   curtain of a theater. I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical
   machine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all
   the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant.
   Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting
   disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien,
   unknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered
   into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa. Foremost
   among the living objects were inky, jellyfish monstrosities which
   flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine. They
   were present in loathsome profusion, and I saw to my horror that they
   overlapped; that they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through
   one another and through what we know as solids. These things were never
   still, but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose.
   Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker launching
   itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from
   sight. Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the
   unfortunate servants, and could not exclude the thing from my mind as I
   strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies
   unseen around us. But Tillinghast had been watching me and was
   speaking.

   "You see them? You see them? You see the things that float and flop
   about you and through you every moment of your life? You see the
   creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky? Have I
   not succeeded in breaking down the barrier; have I not shown you worlds
   that no other living men have seen?" I heard his scream through the
   horrible chaos, and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close
   to mine. His eyes were pits of flame, and they glared at me with what I
   now saw was overwhelming hatred. The machine droned detestably.

   "You think those floundering things wiped out the servants? Fool, they
   are harmless! But the servants are gone, aren't they? You tried to stop
   me; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I
   could get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned coward, but
   now I've got you! What swept up the servants? What made them scream so
   loud?... Don't know, eh! You'll know soon enough. Look at me - listen
   to what I say - do you suppose there are really any such things as time
   and magnitude? Do you fancy there are such things as form or matter? I
   tell you, I have struck depths that your little brain can't picture. I
   have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from the
   stars... I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world
   to sow death and madness... Space belongs to me, do you hear? Things
   are hunting me now - the things that devour and dissolve - but I know
   how to elude them. It is you they will get, as they got the servants...
   Stirring, dear sir? I told you it was dangerous to move, I have saved
   you so far by telling you to keep still - saved you to see more sights
   and to listen to me. If you had moved, they would have been at you long
   ago. Don't worry, they won't hurt you. They didn't hurt the servants -
   it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so. My pets are not
   pretty, for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are -
   very different. Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you -- but I
   want you to see them. I almost saw them, but I knew how to stop. You
   are curious? I always knew you were no scientist. Trembling, eh.
   Trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things I have discovered.
   Why don't you move, then? Tired? Well, don't worry, my friend, for they
   are coming... Look, look, curse you, look... it's just over your left
   shoulder..."

   What remains to be told is very brief, and may be familiar to you from
   the newspaper accounts. The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast
   house and found us there - Tillinghast dead and me unconscious. They
   arrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but released me in
   three hours, after they found it was apoplexy which had finished
   Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious
   machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor. I
   did not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the coroner
   would be skeptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor
   told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and
   homicidal madman.

   I wish I could believe that doctor. It would help my shaky nerves if I
   could dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about and
   above me. I never feel alone or comfortable, and a hideous sense of
   pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when I am weary. What prevents
   me from believing the doctor is one simple fact - that the police never
   found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast
   murdered.

I. The Book[edit]

   The place was dark and dusty and half-lost
   In tangles of old alleys near the quays,
   Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas,
   And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed.
   Small lozenge panes, obscured by smoke and frost,
   Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees,
   Rotting from floor to roof - congeries
   Of crumbling elder lore at little cost.

   I entered, charmed, and from a cobwebbed heap
   Took up the nearest tome and thumbed it through,
   Trembling at curious words that seemed to keep
   Some secret, monstrous if one only knew.
   Then, looking for some seller old in craft,
   I could find nothing but a voice that laughed.

II. Pursuit[edit]

   I held the book beneath my coat, at pains
   To hide the thing from sight in such a place;
   Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes
   With often-turning head and nervous pace.
   Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brick
   Peered at me oddly as I hastened by,
   And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sick
   For a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky.

   No one had seen me take the thing - but still
   A blank laugh echoed in my whirling head,
   And I could guess what nighted worlds of ill
   Lurked in that volume I had coveted.
   The way grew strange - the walls alike and madding -
   And far behind me, unseen feet were padding.

III. The Key[edit]

   I do not know what windings in the waste
   Of those strange sea-lanes brought me home once more,
   But on my porch I trembled, white with haste
   To get inside and bolt the heavy door.
   I had the book that told the hidden way
   Across the void and through the space-hung screens
   That hold the undimensioned worlds at bay,
   And keep lost aeons to their own demesnes.

   At last the key was mine to those vague visions
   Of sunset spires and twilight woods that brood
   Dim in the gulfs beyond this earth's precisions,
   Lurking as memories of infinitude.
   The key was mine, but as I sat there mumbling,
   The attic window shook with a faint fumbling.

IV. Recognition[edit]

   The day had come again, when as a child
   I saw - just once - that hollow of old oaks,
   Grey with a ground-mist that enfolds and chokes
   The slinking shapes which madness has defiled.
   It was the same - an herbage rank and wild
   Clings round an altar whose carved sign invokes
   That Nameless One to whom a thousand smokes
   Rose, aeons gone, from unclean towers up-piled.

   I saw the body spread on that dank stone,
   And knew those things which feasted were not men;
   I knew this strange, grey world was not my own,
   But Yuggoth, past the starry voids - and then
   The body shrieked at me with a dead cry,
   And all too late I knew that it was I!

V. Homecoming[edit]

   The daemon said that he would take me home
   To the pale, shadowy land I half recalled
   As a high place of stair and terrace, walled
   With marble balustrades that sky-winds comb,
   While miles below a maze of dome on dome
   And tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled.
   Once more, he told me, I would stand enthralled
   On those old heights, and hear the far-off foam.

   All this he promised, and through sunset's gate
   He swept me, past the lapping lakes of flame,
   And red-gold thrones of gods without a name
   Who shriek in fear at some impending fate.
   Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night:
   "Here was your home," he mocked, "when you had sight!"

VI. The Lamp[edit]

   We found the lamp inside those hollow cliffs
   Whose chiseled sign no priest in Thebes could read,
   And from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphs
   Warned every living creature of earth's breed.
   No more was there - just that one brazen bowl
   With traces of a curious oil within;
   Fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll,
   And symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin.

   Little the fears of forty centuries meant
   To us as we bore off our slender spoil,
   And when we scanned it in our darkened tent
   We struck a match to test the ancient oil.
   It blazed - great God!... But the vast shapes we saw
   In that mad flash have seared our lives with awe.

VII. Zaman's Hill[edit]

   The great hill hung close over the old town,
   A precipice against the main street's end;
   Green, tall, and wooded, looking darkly down
   Upon the steeple at the highway bend.
   Two hundred years the whispers had been heard
   About what happened on the man-shunned slope -
   Tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird,
   Or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope.

   One day the mail-man found no village there,
   Nor were its folk or houses seen again;
   People came out from Aylesbury to stare -
   Yet they all told the mail-man it was plain
   That he was mad for saying he had spied
   The great hill's gluttonous eyes, and jaws stretched wide.

VIII. The Port[edit]

   Ten miles from Arkham I had struck the trail
   That rides the cliff-edge over Boynton Beach,
   And hoped that just at sunset I could reach
   The crest that looks on Innsmouth in the vale.
   Far out at sea was a retreating sail,
   White as hard years of ancient winds could bleach,
   But evil with some portent beyond speech,
   So that I did not wave my hand or hail.

   Sails out of Innsmouth! echoing old renown
   Of long-dead times. But now a too-swift night
   Is closing in, and I have reached the height
   Whence I so often scan the distant town.
   The spires and roofs are there - but look! The gloom
   Sinks on dark lanes, as lightless as the tomb!

IX. The Courtyard[edit]

   It was the city I had known before;
   The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngs
   Chant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongs
   In crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore.
   The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at me
   From where they leaned, drunk and half-animate,
   As edging through the filth I passed the gate
   To the black courtyard where the man would be.

   The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursed
   That ever I had come to such a den,
   When suddenly a score of windows burst
   Into wild light, and swarmed with dancing men:
   Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead -
   And not a corpse had either hands or head!

X. The Pigeon-Flyers[edit]

   They took me slumming, where gaunt walls of brick
   Bulge outward with a viscous stored-up evil,
   And twisted faces, thronging foul and thick,
   Wink messages to alien god and devil.
   A million fires were blazing in the streets,
   And from flat roofs a furtive few would fly
   Bedraggled birds into the yawning sky
   While hidden drums droned on with measured beats.

   I knew those fires were brewing monstrous things,
   And that those birds of space had been Outside -
   I guessed to what dark planet's crypts they plied,
   And what they brought from Thog beneath their wings.
   The others laughed - till struck too mute to speak
   By what they glimpsed in one bird's evil beak.

XI. The Well[edit]

   Farmer Seth Atwood was past eighty when
   He tried to sink that deep well by his door,
   With only Eb to help him bore and bore.
   We laughed, and hoped he'd soon be sane again.
   And yet, instead, young Eb went crazy, too,
   So that they shipped him to the county farm.
   Seth bricked the well-mouth up as tight as glue -
   Then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm.

   After the funeral we felt bound to get
   Out to that well and rip the bricks away,
   But all we saw were iron hand-holds set
   Down a black hole deeper than we could say.
   And yet we put the bricks back - for we found
   The hole too deep for any line to sound.

XII. The Howler[edit]

   They told me not to take the Briggs' Hill path
   That used to be the highroad through to Zoar,
   For Goody Watkins, hanged in seventeen-four,
   Had left a certain monstrous aftermath.
   Yet when I disobeyed, and had in view
   The vine-hung cottage by the great rock slope,
   I could not think of elms or hempen rope,
   But wondered why the house still seemed so new.

   Stopping a while to watch the fading day,
   I heard faint howls, as from a room upstairs,
   When through the ivied panes one sunset ray
   Struck in, and caught the howler unawares.
   I glimpsed - and ran in frenzy from the place,
   And from a four-pawed thing with human face.

XIII. Hesperia[edit]

   The winter sunset, flaming beyond spires
   And chimneys half-detached from this dull sphere,
   Opens great gates to some forgotten year
   Of elder splendours and divine desires.
   Expectant wonders burn in those rich fires,
   Adventure-fraught, and not untinged with fear;
   A row of sphinxes where the way leads clear
   Toward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres.

   It is the land where beauty's meaning flowers;
   Where every unplaced memory has a source;
   Where the great river Time begins its course
   Down the vast void in starlit streams of hours.
   Dreams bring us close - but ancient lore repeats
   That human tread has never soiled these streets.

XIV. Star-Winds[edit]

   It is a certain hour of twilight glooms,
   Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind pours
   Down hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors,
   But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms.
   The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic twists,
   And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,
   Heeding geometries of outer space,
   While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists.

   This is the hour when moonstruck poets know
   What fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scents
   And tints of flowers fill Nithon's continents,
   Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.
   Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
   A dozen more of ours they sweep away!

XV. Antarktos[edit]

   Deep in my dream the great bird whispered queerly
   Of the black cone amid the polar waste;
   Pushing above the ice-sheet lone and drearly,
   By storm-crazed aeons battered and defaced.
   Hither no living earth-shapes take their courses,
   And only pale auroras and faint suns
   Glow on that pitted rock, whose primal sources
   Are guessed at dimly by the Elder Ones.

   If men should glimpse it, they would merely wonder
   What tricky mound of Nature's build they spied;
   But the bird told of vaster parts, that under
   The mile-deep ice-shroud crouch and brood and bide.
   God help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
   Those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below!

XVI. The Window[edit]

   The house was old, with tangled wings outthrown,
   Of which no one could ever half keep track,
   And in a small room somewhat near the back
   Was an odd window sealed with ancient stone.
   There, in a dream-plagued childhood, quite alone
   I used to go, where night reigned vague and black;
   Parting the cobwebs with a curious lack
   Of fear, and with a wonder each time grown.

   One later day I brought the masons there
   To find what view my dim forbears had shunned,
   But as they pierced the stone, a rush of air
   Burst from the alien voids that yawned beyond.
   They fled - but I peered through and found unrolled
   All the wild worlds of which my dreams had told.

XVII. A Memory[edit]

   There were great steppes, and rocky table-lands
   Stretching half-limitless in starlit night,
   With alien campfires shedding feeble light
   On beasts with tinkling bells, in shaggy bands.
   Far to the south the plain sloped low and wide
   To a dark zigzag line of wall that lay
   Like a huge python of some primal day
   Which endless time had chilled and petrified.

   I shivered oddly in the cold, thin air,
   And wondered where I was and how I came,
   When a cloaked form against a campfire's glare
   Rose and approached, and called me by my name.
   Staring at that dead face beneath the hood,
   I ceased to hope - because I understood.

XVIII. The Gardens of Yin[edit]

   Beyond that wall, whose ancient masonry
   Reached almost to the sky in moss-thick towers,
   There would be terraced gardens, rich with flowers,
   And flutter of bird and butterfly and bee.
   There would be walks, and bridges arching over
   Warm lotos-pools reflecting temple eaves,
   And cherry-trees with delicate boughs and leaves
   Against a pink sky where the herons hover.

   All would be there, for had not old dreams flung
   Open the gate to that stone-lanterned maze
   Where drowsy streams spin out their winding ways,
   Trailed by green vines from bending branches hung?
   I hurried - but when the wall rose, grim and great,
   I found there was no longer any gate.

XIX. The Bells[edit]

   Year after year I heard that faint, far ringing
   Of deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind;
   Peals from no steeple I could ever find,
   But strange, as if across some great void winging.
   I searched my dreams and memories for a clue,
   And thought of all the chimes my visions carried;
   Of quiet Innsmouth, where the white gulls tarried
   Around an ancient spire that once I knew.

   Always perplexed I heard those far notes falling,
   Till one March night the bleak rain splashing cold
   Beckoned me back through gateways of recalling
   To elder towers where the mad clappers tolled.
   They tolled - but from the sunless tides that pour
   Through sunken valleys on the sea's dead floor.

XX. Night-Gaunts[edit]

   Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,
   But every night I see the rubbery things,
   Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings,
   And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell.
   They come in legions on the north wind's swell,
   With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,
   Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings
   To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare's well.

   Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep,
   Heedless of all the cries I try to make,
   And down the nether pits to that foul lake
   Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.
   But oh! If only they would make some sound,
   Or wear a face where faces should be found!

XXI. Nyarlathotep[edit]

   And at the last from inner Egypt came
   The strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed;
   Silent and lean and cryptically proud,
   And wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame.
   Throngs pressed around, frantic for his commands,
   But leaving, could not tell what they had heard;
   While through the nations spread the awestruck word
   That wild beasts followed him and licked his hands.

   Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;
   Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;
   The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled
   Down on the quaking citadels of man.
   Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,
   The idiot Chaos blew Earth's dust away.

XXII. Azathoth[edit]

   Out in the mindless void the daemon bore me,
   Past the bright clusters of dimensioned space,
   Till neither time nor matter stretched before me,
   But only Chaos, without form or place.
   Here the vast Lord of All in darkness muttered
   Things he had dreamed but could not understand,
   While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered
   In idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned.

   They danced insanely to the high, thin whining
   Of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw,
   Whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining
   Gives each frail cosmos its eternal law.
   "I am His Messenger," the daemon said,
   As in contempt he struck his Master's head.

XXIII. Mirage[edit]

   I do not know if ever it existed -
   That lost world floating dimly on Time's stream -
   And yet I see it often, violet-misted,
   And shimmering at the back of some vague dream.
   There were strange towers and curious lapping rivers,
   Labyrinths of wonder, and low vaults of light,
   And bough-crossed skies of flame, like that which quivers
   Wistfully just before a winter's night.

   Great moors led off to sedgy shores unpeopled,
   Where vast birds wheeled, while on a windswept hill
   There was a village, ancient and white-steepled,
   With evening chimes for which I listen still.
   I do not know what land it is - or dare
   Ask when or why I was, or will be, there.

XXIV. The Canal[edit]

   Somewhere in dream there is an evil place
   Where tall, deserted buildings crowd along
   A deep, black, narrow channel, reeking strong
   Of frightful things whence oily currents race.
   Lanes with old walls half meeting overhead
   Wind off to streets one may or may not know,
   And feeble moonlight sheds a spectral glow
   Over long rows of windows, dark and dead.

   There are no footfalls, and the one soft sound
   Is of the oily water as it glides
   Under stone bridges, and along the sides
   Of its deep flume, to some vague ocean bound.
   None lives to tell when that stream washed away
   Its dream-lost region from the world of clay.

XXV. St. Toad's[edit]

   "Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" I heard him scream
   As I plunged into those mad lanes that wind
   In labyrinths obscure and undefined
   South of the river where old centuries dream.
   He was a furtive figure, bent and ragged,
   And in a flash had staggered out of sight,
   So still I burrowed onward in the night
   Toward where more roof-lines rose, malign and jagged.

   No guide-book told of what was lurking here -
   But now I heard another old man shriek:
   "Beware St.Toad's cracked chimes!" And growing weak,
   I paused, when a third greybeard croaked in fear:
   "Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" Aghast, I fled -
   Till suddenly that black spire loomed ahead.

XXVI. The Familiars[edit]

   John Whateley lived about a mile from town,
   Up where the hills begin to huddle thick;
   We never thought his wits were very quick,
   Seeing the way he let his farm run down.
   He used to waste his time on some queer books
   He'd found around the attic of his place,
   Till funny lines got creased into his face,
   And folks all said they didn't like his looks.

   When he began those night-howls we declared
   He'd better be locked up away from harm,
   So three men from the Aylesbury town farm
   Went for him - but came back alone and scared.
   They'd found him talking to two crouching things
   That at their step flew off on great black wings.

XXVII. The Elder Pharos[edit]

   From Leng, where rocky peaks climb bleak and bare
   Under cold stars obscure to human sight,
   There shoots at dusk a single beam of light
   Whose far blue rays make shepherds whine in prayer.
   They say (though none has been there) that it comes
   Out of a pharos in a tower of stone,
   Where the last Elder One lives on alone,
   Talking to Chaos with the beat of drums.

   The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask
   Of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide
   A face not of this earth, though none dares ask
   Just what those features are, which bulge inside.
   Many, in man's first youth, sought out that glow,
   But what they found, no one will ever know.

XXVIII. Expectancy[edit]

   I cannot tell why some things hold for me
   A sense of unplumbed marvels to befall,
   Or of a rift in the horizon's wall
   Opening to worlds where only gods can be.
   There is a breathless, vague expectancy,
   As of vast ancient pomps I half recall,
   Or wild adventures, uncorporeal,
   Ecstasy-fraught, and as a day-dream free.

   It is in sunsets and strange city spires,
   Old villages and woods and misty downs,
   South winds, the sea, low hills, and lighted towns,
   Old gardens, half-heard songs, and the moon's fires.
   But though its lure alone makes life worth living,
   None gains or guesses what it hints at giving.

XXIX. Nostalgia[edit]

   Once every year, in autumn's wistful glow,
   The birds fly out over an ocean waste,
   Calling and chattering in a joyous haste
   To reach some land their inner memories know.
   Great terraced gardens where bright blossoms blow,
   And lines of mangoes luscious to the taste,
   And temple-groves with branches interlaced
   Over cool paths - all these their vague dreams shew.

   They search the sea for marks of their old shore -
   For the tall city, white and turreted -
   But only empty waters stretch ahead,
   So that at last they turn away once more.
   Yet sunken deep where alien polyps throng,
   The old towers miss their lost, remembered song.

XXX. Background[edit]

   I never can be tied to raw, new things,
   For I first saw the light in an old town,
   Where from my window huddled roofs sloped down
   To a quaint harbour rich with visionings.
   Streets with carved doorways where the sunset beams
   Flooded old fanlights and small window-panes,
   And Georgian steeples topped with gilded vanes -
   These were the sights that shaped my childhood dreams.

   Such treasures, left from times of cautious leaven,
   Cannot but loose the hold of flimsier wraiths
   That flit with shifting ways and muddled faiths
   Across the changeless walls of earth and heaven.
   They cut the moment's thongs and leave me free
   To stand alone before eternity.

XXXI. The Dweller[edit]

   It had been old when Babylon was new;
   None knows how long it slept beneath that mound,
   Where in the end our questing shovels found
   Its granite blocks and brought it back to view.
   There were vast pavements and foundation-walls,
   And crumbling slabs and statues, carved to shew
   Fantastic beings of some long ago
   Past anything the world of man recalls.

   And then we saw those stone steps leading down
   Through a choked gate of graven dolomite
   To some black haven of eternal night
   Where elder signs and primal secrets frown.
   We cleared a path - but raced in mad retreat
   When from below we heard those clumping feet.

XXXII. Alienation[edit]

   His solid flesh had never been away,
   For each dawn found him in his usual place,
   But every night his spirit loved to race
   Through gulfs and worlds remote from common day.
   He had seen Yaddith, yet retained his mind,
   And come back safely from the Ghooric zone,
   When one still night across curved space was thrown
   That beckoning piping from the voids behind.

   He waked that morning as an older man,
   And nothing since has looked the same to him.
   Objects around float nebulous and dim -
   False, phantom trifles of some vaster plan.
   His folk and friends are now an alien throng
   To which he struggles vainly to belong.

XXXIII. Harbour Whistles[edit]

   Over old roofs and past decaying spires
   The harbour whistles chant all through the night;
   Throats from strange ports, and beaches far and white,
   And fabulous oceans, ranged in motley choirs.
   Each to the other alien and unknown,
   Yet all, by some obscurely focussed force
   From brooding gulfs beyond the Zodiac's course,
   Fused into one mysterious cosmic drone.

   Through shadowy dreams they send a marching line
   Of still more shadowy shapes and hints and views;
   Echoes from outer voids, and subtle clues
   To things which they themselves cannot define.
   And always in that chorus, faintly blent,
   We catch some notes no earth-ship ever sent.

XXXIV. Recapture[edit]

   The way led down a dark, half-wooded heath
   Where moss-grey boulders humped above the mould,
   And curious drops, disquieting and cold,
   Sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath.
   There was no wind, nor any trace of sound
   In puzzling shrub, or alien-featured tree,
   Nor any view before - till suddenly,
   Straight in my path, I saw a monstrous mound.

   Half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread,
   Rank-grassed, and cluttered by a crumbling flight
   Of lava stairs that scaled the fear-topped height
   In steps too vast for any human tread.
   I shrieked - and knew what primal star and year
   Had sucked me back from man's dream-transient sphere!

XXXV. Evening Star[edit]

   I saw it from that hidden, silent place
   Where the old wood half shuts the meadow in.
   It shone through all the sunset's glories - thin
   At first, but with a slowly brightening face.
   Night came, and that lone beacon, amber-hued,
   Beat on my sight as never it did of old;
   The evening star - but grown a thousandfold
   More haunting in this hush and solitude.

   It traced strange pictures on the quivering air -
   Half-memories that had always filled my eyes -
   Vast towers and gardens; curious seas and skies
   Of some dim life - I never could tell where.
   But now I knew that through the cosmic dome
   Those rays were calling from my far, lost home.

XXXVI. Continuity[edit]

   There is in certain ancient things a trace
   Of some dim essence - more than form or weight;
   A tenuous aether, indeterminate,
   Yet linked with all the laws of time and space.
   A faint, veiled sign of continuities
   That outward eyes can never quite descry;
   Of locked dimensions harbouring years gone by,
   And out of reach except for hidden keys.

   It moves me most when slanting sunbeams glow
   On old farm buildings set against a hill,
   And paint with life the shapes which linger still
   From centuries less a dream than this we know.
   In that strange light I feel I am not far
   From the fixt mass whose sides the ages are.

Good Saint Nick[edit]

   May good St. Nick, like as a bird of night,
   Bring thee rich blessings in his annual flight;
   Long by thy chimney rest his pond'rous pack,
   And leave with lessen'd weight upon his back!

   H. P. LOVECRAFT, AN EVALUATION

   Since the publication of my "H. P. Lovecraft: A Bibliography" (Biblio
   Press, 1952), I have been repeatedly urged to write out my opinion of
   Lovecraft's work. I have been kept from doing so by the pressure of a
   full-time library job, plus my own creative work in the diverse fields
   of the horror story, the western story, and poetry, as well as the
   semi-annual publication of ESSENCE and other time-consuming activities
   such as an unending struggle against censorship groups which are
   violating Constitutional rights on both a local and national level.

   The following brief essay is an admittedly hurried and incomplete
   attempt to meet demands for a Lovecraft critique. An entire book,
   requiring many months of uninterrupted work, could be devoted to the
   project and I sincerely regret that circumstances do not permit me to
   undertake such a task. But I hope that my comments, in spite of their
   brevity, will be of some interest.

   Nearly twenty years have passed since Lovecraft's death, but,
   unfortunately, a final evaluation of the man and of his work is still
   not possible. His collected poems, though due to appear shortly, have
   not yet been published. His letters, either selected or collected, have
   not appeared. Probably some of the pieces which he contributed under
   pseudonyms to "little" magazines have never been reprinted. And of
   course no complete and carefully written biography of the man has ever
   been published.

   With the important exception of the poems and letters however, all of
   Lovecraft's work of any significance has been in print for some years.
   It seems doubtful, therefore, that an evaluation of his work, at this
   time, will be seriously qualified by future publication.

   In his essay on Lovecraft, "Tales of the Marvellous and the
   Ridiculous", which originally appeared in "The New Yorker" and was
   later reprinted in his book, "Classics and Commercials", Edmund Wilson
   states flatly: "Lovecraft was not a good writer." (Before Lovecraft
   admirers reach for their shotguns, I might point out that Edmund Wilson
   also refers to no less a literary figure than Somerset Maugham as
   "second-rate" and "a half-trashy novelist.") Even though his criticism
   is far too severe--too much of a generalization--Wilson does call
   attention to two Lovecraft faults which I must reluctantly acknowledge:
   his frequent prolixity and his tendency to lean on shopworn adjectives
   such as "terrible", "horrible", "hellish", etc. to achieve eerie
   effects. In a good horror story, adjectives such as this are best
   omitted or at least introduced very sparingly. Beyond these criticisms,
   Wilson emphasizes the essential weakness and lack of verisimilitude of
   the "Cthulhu Mythos" episodes. With this, too, I must grudgingly agree.
   And at this point I would like to call attention to the fact that the
   two specific faults mentioned immediately above--prolixity and
   adjectivitus--are more frequently encountered in the "Mythos" stories
   than in any others.

   The "Cthulhu Mythos" has raised a great commotion. Over a period of
   years, enthusiastic collaborators, imitators, friends and admirers have
   elevated the Cthulhu myth to a pedestal of importance which it scarcely
   deserves. The "Mythos" did indeed become the frame for Lovecraft's
   later tales, but they were not his best tales. Lovecraft also amused
   himself by employing Cthulhu terminology in some of his huge
   correspondence, but it now seems doubtful that he attached as much
   importance to the "Mythos" as do some of his disciples!

   Many of the Cthulhu stories, such as "The Dunwich Horror" and "The
   Whisperer in Darkness", are actually tedious. They are too long; our
   interest is apt to flag; our "willing suspension of disbelief" may not
   hold to the final page. All too often we read on without compulsion,
   without belief, without very much actual enthusiasm.

   Lovecraft often seems so intent on introducing and exploiting the
   "Mythos", he loses sight of some of the basic elements which are
   essential in a good short story: economy of wordage, verisimilitude,
   mounting suspense sweeping to a single climax followed quickly by the
   final denouement.

   Referring to the "Mythos", Edmund Wilson concluded: "It is all more
   amusing in his letters than it is in the stories themselves." Of course
   it was not intended to be amusing in the stories, but I think Wilson's
   meaning is clear.

   When it still possessed the freshness of novelty, the Cthulhu Mythology
   afforded a vast amount of entertainment. But with the passage of time
   the novelty has evaporated and the myth has become threadbare.
   Lovecraft used it in story after story and his disciples have exploited
   it since his death and it now seems wrung nearly dry of interesting
   effects.

   It remains, of course, an integral part of the bulk of Lovecraft's
   work. To attempt to dismiss it as incidental or unimportant would be to
   close our eyes to the facts.

   In my opinion however, Lovecraft's future reputation as a writer of
   fine horror stories will rest on a very few of his early tales in which
   the Cthulhu Mythos is either entirely absent or at most still in its
   formative stages in Lovecraft's own mind. These early stories which I
   mean to mention were published prior to the appearance of the first
   generally accepted "Mythos" story: "The Call of Cthulhu" (WEIRD TALES,
   February, 1928)

   These stories are: "The Hound" (WEIRD TALES, February, 1924); "The Rats
   in the Walls" (WEIRD TALES, March, 1924); "The Music of Erich Zann"
   (WEIRD TALES, May, 1925); "The Outsider" (WEIRD TALES, April, 1926);
   "Pickman's Model" (WEIRD TALES, October, 1927)

   Of these I think the best of all is "The Music of Erich Zann." This
   piece, which might have been written by Poe, has everything which many
   of the "Mythos" tales lack: compression, sustained and rising suspense
   culminating in a powerfully effective climax followed almost
   immediately by the end of the story. Stylistically and structurally, I
   think Lovecraft never surpassed it. I think it probable that the old
   German mute will go on sawing his accursed viol in that ghoul-infested
   garret long after great Cthulhu has lapsed into silence! This story,
   like Poe's masterpiece, "The Cask of Amontillado", seems literally
   above criticism. There are no wasted words. The brief story unfolds
   with a remorseless inevitability. Nothing could be omitted, nothing
   added, nothing changed which would improve its quality. In its
   particular genre it remains a pure masterpiece.

   After "The Music of Erich Zann", I would cite "The Rats in the Walls"
   Actually, I very nearly voted it first place because it achieves a
   pitch of sheer grisly horror which exceeds the taut terror of "The
   Music of Erich Zann." On the other hand, it does not possess quite the
   same degree of purity and compression. But it is a masterpiece of its
   type, and again I can think of no Lovecraft story after "The Music of
   Erich Zann" which equals it. As a matter of fact, one almost feels that
   Lovecraft has gone too far in this particular story. Something inside
   one rebels as the ghastly eldrich grottos reveal their loathsome
   secrets. Perhaps it is simply that one instinctively refuses to believe
   that homo sapiens could ever descend to such a hellish sub-level. But
   this is a philosophical comment, not a criticism of the story.

   "The Rats in the Walls" begins in the somewhat leisurely manner which
   has come to be associated with rather old-fashioned gothic ghost
   stories, and for some little time nothing really hair-raising happens.
   But once the full horror comes to light, it simply overwhelms us. We
   see at once that the leisurely start was intended to lull us a little
   Certainly it kept us interested enough to continue, and we did perhaps
   expect some pretty formidable horrors--but nothing like what we finally
   encounter! For sheer inhuman horror those twilit grottos under the evil
   foundations of Exham Priory have yet to be surpassed.

   In his introduction to "Best Supernatural Stories of H. P . Lovecraft",
   August Derleth states: "It has been said of "The Outsider" that if the
   manuscript had been put forward as an unpublished tale by Edgar Allan
   Poe, none would have challenged it." Perhaps this is not literally
   true, but I agree with the spirit of it. "The Outsider" is one of
   Lovecraft's finest stories. It possesses the merit of compression; with
   rising intensity it achieves its single shuddery effect--and ends. Some
   aspects of this story call to mind Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death";
   both stories achieve their effects with a minimum of wordage, both
   linger in the mind.

   "Pickman's Model" is one of Lovecraft's strongest stories. It has unity
   of effect, suspense, a highly original plot idea, and a climax which
   neatly and forcefully ends the story. It is not quite as tightly knit
   as "The Music of Erich Zann" or "The Outsider", but it is still
   Lovecraft writing at his top-level best. The "nameless blasphemy with
   glaring red eyes" gnawing at a human head would probably feel at home
   in one of those unspeakable grottos under the infamous walls of Exham
   Priory!

   I have mentioned Lovecraft's "The Hound" because it has remained in my
   mind after I first read it many years ago. Its structure is somewhat
   slight and it does not have the power of Lovecraft's very best tales,
   but it has splendid atmosphere and, again, brevity and unity of effect.
   It might have been written by the early Poe. But I cite it primarily
   because it has lingered long in my mind.

   The limitations of this little critique do not permit me to touch on
   many other good Lovecraft stories. I have mentioned only five which I
   think are the best. I am merely expressing a personal opinion--a
   personal taste--and I am more than willing to admit of other
   opinions--no matter how they may differ from my own. Time alone will
   decide who is right!

   I have not yet seen all of Lovecraft's poetry, but I think I have seen
   enough to comment briefly. Much of the poetry falls into two main
   categories: deliberately archaic work imitative of eighteenth-century
   verse, and a group of weird sonnets known as "Fungi from Yuggoth." The
   imitative verse is interesting and often competent, but I think the
   "Fungi" sonnets are far more arresting and effective. A few of the very
   best of them may survive.

   Any criticism of Lovecraft's work, no matter how brief, would be
   incomplete if it omitted mention of his famous essay, "Supernatural
   Horror in Literature." Even Edmund Wilson concedes that the essay is "a
   really able piece of work." In my pamphlet, "H. P. Lovecraft: A
   Bibliography", I commented: "The background and evolution of the horror
   tale--a "must" for anyone seriously interested in the genre." The
   comment still holds. Apart from the letters, I think it is probably the
   finest piece of non-fiction which Lovecraft ever wrote.

   Judging from the few letters and extracts from letters which are in
   print, Lovecraft's "Selected Letters" (or "Collected") will definitely
   enhance his reputation. It is probable that their publication will
   revive and intensify interest in both the man and his work. Lovecraft's
   erudition, humor and style is such that it is even possible they will
   eventually tend to eclipse his other work! At this point we can only
   wait and see.

   Lovecraft's final place in American literature has not yet been
   determined. It is too early for that. But it seems certain that the
   very best of his work will endure, that it will remain important in the
   particular field which he chose. If he did not reach the summits
   attained by Poe, or Bierce, at his best he scaled some dizzy heights.

   NOTE

   This bibliography is a direct outgrowth of my earlier, privately
   printed "Select Bibliography of H. P. Lovecraft." It contains most of
   the information which was not included in that original checklist--a
   complete list of the short stories, all the anthologies, additional
   title and other pertinent items of interest. Also, many of the
   annotations which appeared in the earlier checklist have herein been
   revised and enlarged.

   I am immensely indebted to August Derleth for his enthusiastic and
   wholehearted assistance. He has supplied me with much vital information
   which it would have been virtually impossible for me to obtain unaided.
   While busy with his own work, he took time out to read the original
   manuscript of the bibliography and to point out important corrections
   and additions.

   Also, I wish to extend wholehearted thanks to Miss Marion E. Brown, In
   Charge, Special Collections, Brown University Library, for her kindness
   in listing and describing various Lovecraft items at Brown which are
   under her care. Without her generous contributions of both patience and
   time, most of these items would probably have remained inaccessible to
   me ...

   I am solely responsible, however, for any errors which may come to
   light.

   The steeples are white in the wild moonlight,
      And the trees have a silver glare;
   Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,
      And the harpies of upper air,
      That flutter and laugh and stare.

   For the village dead to the moon outspread
      Never shone in the sunset's gleam,
   But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep
      Where the rivers of madness stream
      Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.

   A chill wind weaves through the rows of sheaves
      In the meadows that shimmer pale,
   And comes to twine where the headstones shine
      And the ghouls of the churchyard wail
      For harvests that fly and fail.

   Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change
      That tore from the past its own
   Can quicken this hour, when a spectral power
      Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne,
      And looses the vast unknown.

   So here again stretch the vale and plain
      That moons long-forgotten saw,
   And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,
      Sprung out of the tomb's black maw
      To shake all the world with awe.

   And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,
      The ugliness and the pest
   Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,
      Shall some day be with the rest,
      And brood with the shades unblest.

   Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,
      And the leprous spires ascend;
   For new and old alike in the fold
      Of horror and death are penned,
      For the hounds of Time to rend.

   He  (1926)
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Related Portals. related portals: Horror.

   "He" is a short story written August 1925, and first published in Weird
   Tales, September 1926.-- Excerpted from He (short story) on Wikipedia,
   the free encyclopedia.
   13495HeH. P. Lovecraft1926

   I saw him on a sleepless night when I was walking desperately to save
   my soul and my vision. My coming to New York had been a mistake; for
   whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming
   labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten
   courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and
   waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the Cyclopean modern towers and
   pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, I had found
   instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to
   master, paralyze, and annihilate me.

   The disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time upon the
   town, I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its
   waters, its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and
   delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming clouds and
   the first stars of evening. Then it had lighted up window by window
   above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep
   horns bayed weird harmonies, and had itself become a starry firmament
   of dream, redolent of faery music, and one with the marvels of
   Carcassonne and Samarcand and El Dorado and all glorious and
   half-fabulous cities. Shortly afterward I was taken through those
   antique ways so dear to my fancy--narrow, curving alleys and passages
   where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with small-paned dormers above
   pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and paneled
   coaches--and in the first flush of realization of these long-wished
   things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me
   in time a poet.

   But success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight showed only
   squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing,
   spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder
   magic; and the throngs of people that seethed through the flume-like
   streets were squat, swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow
   eyes, shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes
   about them, who could never mean aught to a blue-eyed man of the old
   folk, with the love of fair green lanes and white New England village
   steeples in his heart.

   So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering
   blackness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth
   which no one had ever dared to breathe before--the unwhisperable secret
   of secrets--the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a
   sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is of Old London and
   Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling
   body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which
   have nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this
   discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned
   tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off
   the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness
   calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraith-like about, and
   old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through
   them. With this mode of relief I even wrote a few poems, and still
   refrained from going home to my people lest I seem to crawl back
   ignobly in defeat.

   Then, on a sleepless night's walk, I met the man. It was in a grotesque
   hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my ignorance I
   had settled, having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and
   artists. The archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and
   court had indeed delighted me, and when I found the poets and artists
   to be loud-voiced pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives
   are a denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art, I stayed
   on for love of these venerable things. I fancied them as they were in
   their prime, when Greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by
   the town; and in the hours before dawn, when all the revellers had
   slunk away, I used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and
   brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited
   there. This kept my soul alive, and gave me a few of those dreams and
   visions for which the poet far within me cried out.

   The man came upon me at about two one cloudy August morning, as I was
   threading a series of detached courtyards; now accessible only through
   the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings, but once forming parts
   of a continuous network of picturesque alleys. I had heard of them by
   vague rumor, and realized that they could not be upon any map of today;
   but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that
   I had sought them with twice my usual eagerness. Now that I had found
   them, my eagerness was again redoubled; for something in their
   arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such,
   with dark, dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls
   and deserted rear tenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways
   unbetrayed by hordes of the foreign-speaking or guarded by furtive and
   uncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite publicity or the
   light of day.

   He spoke to me without invitation, noting my mood and glances as I
   studied certain knockered doorways above iron-railed steps, the pallid
   glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face. His own face was in
   shadow, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly
   with the out-of-date cloak he affected; but I was subtly disquieted
   even before he addressed me. His form was very slight; thin almost to
   cadaverousness; and his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow,
   though not particularly deep. He had, he said, noticed me several times
   at my wanderings; and inferred that I resembled him in loving the
   vestiges of former years. Would I not like the guidance of one long
   practiced in these explorations, and possessed of local information
   profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly
   have gained?

   As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a
   solitary attic window. It was a noble, even a handsome elderly
   countenance; and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for
   the age and place. Yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as
   much as its features pleased me--perhaps it was too white, or too
   expressionless, or too much out of keeping with the locality, to make
   me feel easy or comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for in those
   dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I had
   to keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favor of Fate to fall
   in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much
   farther than mine.

   Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a
   long hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the
   briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes,
   and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed
   through interstices, tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick
   walls, and once crawled on hands and knees through a low, arched
   passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at
   last every hint of geographical location I had managed to preserve. The
   things we saw were very old and marvelous, or at least they seemed so
   in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed them, and I shall
   never forget the tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and
   urn-headed iron fenceposts and flaring-linteled windows and decorative
   fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we
   advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity.

   We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer
   and fewer. The streetlights we first encountered had been of oil, and
   of the ancient lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with candles; and
   at last, after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had
   to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooded
   gate in a high wall, we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by
   lanterns in front of every seventh house--unbelievably Colonial tin
   lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides. This alley
   led steeply uphill--more steeply than I thought possible in this part
   of New York--and the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad
   wall of a private estate, beyond which I could see a pale cupola, and
   the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky. In this
   wall was a small, low-arched gate of nail-studded black oak, which the
   man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key. Leading me within, he
   steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel
   path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house,
   which he unlocked and opened for me.

   We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite
   mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the
   fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice
   this, and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a curving
   stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard him lock
   behind us. Then I saw him pull the curtains of the three small-paned
   windows that barely showed themselves against the lightening sky; after
   which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted two
   candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a gesture
   enjoining soft-toned speech.

   In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious,
   well-furnished and paneled library dating from the first quarter of the
   Eighteenth Century, with splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric
   cornice, and a magnificently carved overmantel with scroll-and-urn top.
   Above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were
   well-wrought family portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness,
   and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to
   a chair beside the graceful Chippendale table. Before seating himself
   across the table from me, my host paused for a moment as if in
   embarrassment; then, tardily removing his gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and
   cloak, stood theatrically revealed in full mid-Georgian costume from
   queued hair and neck ruffles to knee-breeches, silk hose, and the
   buckled shoes I had not previously noticed. Now slowly sinking into a
   lyre-back chair, he commenced to eye me intently.

   Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely
   visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of singular
   longevity were not one of the sources of my disquiet. When he spoke at
   length, his soft, hollow, and carefully muffled voice not infrequently
   quavered; and now and then I had great difficulty in following him as I
   listened with a thrill of amazement and half-disavowed alarm which grew
   each instant.

   "You behold, Sir," my host began, "a man of very eccentrical habits for
   whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and
   inclinations. Reflecting upon better times, I have not scrupled to
   ascertain their ways, and adopt their dress and manners; an indulgence
   which offends none if practised without ostentation. It hath been my
   good fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors, swallowed though
   it was by two towns, first Greenwich, which built up hither after 1800,
   then New York, which joined on near 1830. There were many reasons for
   the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been
   remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it
   in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all
   connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground,
   and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects
   of these arts and discoveries I now purpose to show you, under the
   strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgement of men
   enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity."

   He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was
   alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material
   daylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless
   eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts, I had no choice save to
   follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to
   offer. So I listened.

   "To--my ancestor," he softly continued, "there appeared to reside some
   very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a
   little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one's self and of
   others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and
   over many elements and dimensions deemed more universal than Nature
   herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as
   space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain
   half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians
   showed choler when the place was built, and were plaguey pestilent in
   asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they
   stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth
   performed sartain acts. Then, in '68, the new squire catched them at
   their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained
   with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact
   inwardness of what they did, larning that their grandfathers got part
   of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the
   time of the States-General. And pox on him, I'm afeared the squire must
   have sarved them monstrous bad rum--whether or not by intent--for a
   week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it.
   You, Sir, are the first outsider to be told there is a secret, and
   split me if I'd have risked tampering that much with--the powers--had
   ye not been so hot after bygone things."

   I shuddered as the man grew colloquial--and with the familiar speech of
   another day. He went on.

   "But you must know, Sir, that what--the squire--got from those mongrel
   savages was but a small part of the larning he came to have. He had not
   been at Oxford for nothing, nor talked to no account with an ancient
   chymist and astrologer in Paris. He was, in fine, made sensible that
   all the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of
   the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any
   cloud of prime Virginia tobacco. What we want, we may make about us;
   and what we don't want, we may sweep away. I won't say that all this is
   wholly true in body, but 'tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty
   spectacle now and then. You, I conceive, would be tickled by a better
   sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you; so be pleased
   to hold back any fright at what I design to show. Come to the window
   and be quiet."

   My host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the
   long side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his
   ungloved fingers I turned cold. His flesh, though dry and firm, was of
   the quality of ice; and I almost shrank away from his pulling. But
   again I thought of the emptiness and horror of reality, and boldly
   prepared to follow whithersoever I might be led. Once at the window,
   the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into
   the blackness outside. For a moment I saw nothing save a myriad of tiny
   dancing lights, far, far before me. Then, as if in response to an
   insidious motion of my host's hand, a flash of heat-lightning played
   over the scene, and I looked out upon a sea of luxuriant
   foliage--foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of roofs to be expected by
   any normal mind. On my right the Hudson glittered wickedly, and in the
   distance ahead I saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh
   constellated with nervous fireflies. The flash died, and an evil smile
   illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer.

   "That was before my time--before the new squire's time. Pray let us try
   again."

   I was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed
   city had made me.

   "Good God!" I whispered, "can you do that for any time?" And as he
   nodded, and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs,
   I clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling. But he
   steadied me with that terrible, ice-cold claw, and once more made his
   insidious gesture.

   Again the lightning flashed--but this time upon a scene not wholly
   strange. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be, with here and
   there a roof or row of houses as we see it now, yet with lovely green
   lanes and fields and bits of grassy common. The marsh still glittered
   beyond, but in the farther distance I saw the steeples of what was then
   all of New York; Trinity and St. Paul's and the Brick Church dominating
   their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole.
   I breathed hard, but not so much from the sight itself as from the
   possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up.

   "Can you--dare you--go far?" I spoke with awe and I think he shared it
   for a second, but the evil grin returned.

   "Far? What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone! Back,
   back--forward, forward--look ye puling lackwit!"

   And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing
   to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before. For
   full three seconds I could glimpse that pandemoniac sight, and in those
   seconds I saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams. I
   saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things, and beneath them
   a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids
   flung savagely to the moon, and devil-lights burning from unnumbered
   windows. And swarming loathsomely on aerial galleries I saw the yellow,
   squint-eyed people of that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and
   dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter
   of obscene crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose
   ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the wave of an
   unhallowed ocean of bitumen.

   I saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mind's ear the
   blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the
   shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse-city had ever
   stirred in my soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence I
   screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls
   quivered about me.

   Then, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling too; a
   look of shocking fear half-blotting from his face the serpent
   distortion of rage which my screams had excited. He tottered, clutched
   at the curtains as I had done before, and wriggled his head wildly,
   like a hunted animal. God knows he had cause, for as the echoes of my
   screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive
   that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious. It was the steady,
   stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door, as with the
   ascent of a barefoot or skin-shod horde; and at last the cautious,
   purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble
   candlelight. The old man clawed and spat at me through the moldy air,
   and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he
   clutched.

   "The full moon--damn ye--ye . . . ye yelping dog--ye called 'em, and
   they've come for me! Moccasined feet--dead men--Gad sink ye, ye red
   devils, but I poisoned no rum o' yours--han't I kept your pox-rotted
   magic safe--ye swilled yourselves sick, curse ye, and yet must needs
   blame the squire--let go, you! Unhand that latch--I've naught for ye
   here--"

   At this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of
   the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic
   magician. His fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a
   resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward the
   table on whose edge I was steadying myself. The curtains, still
   clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut and
   finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room
   a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had
   presaged. In those greenish beams the candles paled, and a new
   semblance of decay spread over the musk-reeking room with its wormy
   paneling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture, and ragged
   draperies. It spread over the old man, too, whether from the same
   source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him shrivel and
   blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons.
   Only his eyes stayed whole, and they glared with a propulsive, dilated
   incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled.

   The rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and this time
   bore a hint of metal. The black thing facing me had become only a head
   with eyes, impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my
   direction, and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal
   malice. Now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and
   I saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood. I did not
   move, for I could not; but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces
   to admit a colossal, shapeless influx of inky substance starred with
   shining, malevolent eyes. It poured thickly, like a flood of oil
   bursting a rotten bulkhead, overturned a chair as it spread, and
   finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the
   blackened head with the eyes still glared at me. Around that head it
   closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another moment it had begun to
   recede; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me, and
   flowing again out that black doorway and down the unseen stairs, which
   creaked as before, though in reverse order.

   Then the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into the
   nighted chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half-swooning with
   terror. The green moon, shining through broken windows, showed me the
   hall door half open; and as I rose from the plaster-strewn floor and
   twisted myself free from the sagged ceiling, I saw sweep past it an
   awful torrent of blackness, with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it.
   It was seeking the door to the cellar, and when it found it, vanished
   therein. I now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the
   upper chamber had done, and once a crashing above had been followed by
   the fall past the west window of some thing which must have been the
   cupola. Now liberated for the instant from the wreckage, I rushed
   through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open
   it, seized a chair and broke a window, climbing frenziedly out upon the
   unkempt lawn where moon light danced over yard-high grass and weeds.
   The wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of
   boxes in a corner I managed to gain the top and cling to the great
   stone urn set there.

   About me in my exhaustion I could see only strange walls and windows
   and old gambrel roofs. The steep street of my approach was nowhere
   visible, and the little I did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that
   rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight. Suddenly the
   urn to which I clung began to tremble, as if sharing my own lethal
   dizziness; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to I
   knew not what fate.

   The man who found me said that I must have crawled a long way despite
   my broken bones, for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared
   look. The gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my
   ordeal, and reports could state no more than that I had appeared from a
   place unknown, at the entrance to a little black court off Perry
   Street.

   I never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths, nor would I
   direct any sane man thither if I could. Of who or what that ancient
   creature was, I have no idea; but I repeat that the city is dead and
   full of unsuspected horrors. Whither he has gone, I do not know; but I
   have gone home to the pure New England lanes up which fragrant
   sea-winds sweep at evening.

   History of the Necronomicon
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   Written 1927. Published 1938.
   12042History of the NecronomiconH. P. Lovecraft

   Original title Al Azif -- azif being the word used by Arabs to
   designate that nocturnal sound (made by insects) suppos'd to be the
   howling of daemons.

   Composed by Abdul Alhazred, a mad poet of Sanaá, in Yemen, who is said
   to have flourished during the period of the Ommiade caliphs, circa 700
   A.D. He visited the ruins of Babylon and the subterranean secrets of
   Memphis and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of
   Arabia -- the Roba el Khaliyeh or "Empty Space" of the ancients -- and
   "Dahna" or "Crimson" desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be
   inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this
   desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who
   pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in
   Damascus, where the Necronomicon (Al Azif) was written, and of his
   final death or disappearance (738 A.D.) many terrible and conflicting
   things are told. He is said by Ebn Khallikan (12th cent. biographer) to
   have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured
   horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his
   madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen fabulous Irem, or
   City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain
   nameless desert town the shocking annals and secrets of a race older
   than mankind. He was only an indifferent Moslem, worshipping unknown
   entities whom he called Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu.

   In A.D. 950 the Azif, which had gained a considerable tho'
   surreptitious circulation amongst the philosophers of the age, was
   secretly translated into Greek by Theodorus Philetas of Constantinople
   under the title Necronomicon. For a century it impelled certain
   experimenters to terrible attempts, when it was suppressed and burnt by
   the patriarch Michael. After this it is only heard of furtively, but
   (1228) Olaus Wormius made a Latin translation later in the Middle Ages,
   and the Latin text was printed twice -- once in the fifteenth century
   in black-letter (evidently in Germany) and once in the seventeenth
   (prob. Spanish) -- both editions being without identifying marks, and
   located as to time and place by internal typographical evidence only.
   The work both Latin and Greek was banned by Pope Gregory IX in 1232,
   shortly after its Latin translation, which called attention to it. The
   Arabic original was lost as early as Wormius' time, as indicated by his
   prefatory note; and no sight of the Greek copy -- which was printed in
   Italy between 1500 and 1550 -- has been reported since the burning of a
   certain Salem man's library in 1692. An English translation made by Dr.
   Dee was never printed, and exists only in fragments recovered from the
   original manuscript. Of the Latin texts now existing one (15th cent.)
   is known to be in the British Museum under lock and key, while another
   (17th cent.) is in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. A
   seventeenth-century edition is in the Widener Library at Harvard, and
   in the library of Miskatonic University at Arkham. Also in the library
   of the University of Buenos Aires. Numerous other copies probably exist
   in secret, and a fifteenth-century one is persistently rumoured to form
   part of the collection of a celebrated American millionaire. A still
   vaguer rumour credits the preservation of a sixteenth-century Greek
   text in the Salem family of Pickman; but if it was so preserved, it
   vanished with the artist R. U. Pickman, who disappeared early in 1926.
   The book is rigidly suppressed by the authorities of most countries,
   and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. Reading leads to
   terrible consequences. It was from rumours of this book (of which
   relatively few of the general public know) that Robert W. Chambers is
   said to have derived the idea of his early novel The King in Yellow.

   legally published within the United States (or the United Nations
   Headquarters in New York subject to Section 7 of the United States

   Homecoming

   The Daemon said that he would take me home
   To the pale, shadowy land I half-recalled
   As a high place of stair and terrace, walled
   With marble balustrades that sky-winds comb,
   While miles below a maze of dome on dome
   And tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled,
   Once more, he told me. I would stand enthralled
   On those old heights, and hear the far-off foam.

   All this he promised, and through sunset's gate
   He swept me, past the lapping lakes of flame.
   And red-gold thrones of gods without a name
   Who shriek in fear at some impending fate.
   Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night:
   "Here was your home," he mocked, "when you had sight!"

   Hypnos
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   Written March 1922. Published May 1923 in The National Amateur, Vol.
   45, No. 5, pages 1-3.
   8514HypnosH. P. Lovecraft

     Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we may
     say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be
     incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of
     ignorance of the danger.

                                                               -Baudelaire

   May the merciful gods, if indeed there be such, guard those hours when
   no power of the will, or drug that the cunning of man devises, can keep
   me from the chasm of sleep. Death is merciful, for there is no return
   therefrom, but with him who has come back out of the nethermost
   chambers of night, haggard and knowing, peace rests nevermore. Fool
   that I was to plunge with such unsanctioned frensy into mysteries no
   man was meant to penetrate; fool or god that he was - my only friend,
   who led me and went before me, and who in the end passed into terrors
   which may yet be mine!

   We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the center of a
   crowd of the vulgarly curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a
   kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a
   strange rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age,
   for there were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval
   and actually beautiful; and touches of gray in the thick, waving hair
   and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black.
   His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and
   breadth almost god-like.

   I said to myself, with all the ardor of a sculptor, that this man was a
   faun's statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple's ruins and
   brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and
   pressure of devastating years. And when he opened his immense, sunken,
   and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only
   friend- the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before-
   for I saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and
   the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms
   which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I drove the
   crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and
   leader in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a
   word. Afterward I found that his voice was music- the music of deep
   viols and of crystalline spheres. We talked often in the night, and in
   the day, when I chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in
   ivory to immortalize his different expressions.

   Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a
   connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it. They
   were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and
   consciousness which lies deeper than matter, time, and space, and whose
   existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep- those rare dreams
   beyond dreams which come never to common men, and but once or twice in
   the lifetime of imaginative men. The cosmos of our waking knowledge,
   born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a
   jester, touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source
   when sucked back by the jester's whim. Men of learning suspect it
   little and ignore it mostly. Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the
   gods have laughed. One man with Oriental eyes has said that all time
   and space are relative, and men have laughed. But even that man with
   Oriental eyes has done no more than suspect. I had wished and tried to
   do more than suspect, and my friend had tried and partly succeeded.
   Then we both tried together, and with exotic drugs courted terrible and
   forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manor-house in
   hoary Kent.

   Among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments-
   inarticulateness. What I learned and saw in those hours of impious
   exploration can never be told- for want of symbols or suggestions in
   any language. I say this because from first to last our discoveries
   partook only of the nature of sensations; sensations correlated with no
   impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of
   receiving. They were sensations, yet within them lay unbelievable
   elements of time and space- things which at bottom possess no distinct
   and definite existence. Human utterance can best convey the general
   character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for
   in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away
   from all that is real and present, rushing aerially along shocking,
   unlighted, and fear-haunted abysses, and occasionally tearing through
   certain well-marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous,
   uncouth clouds of vapors.

   In these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and
   sometimes together. When we were together, my friend was always far
   ahead; I could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a
   species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me, golden
   from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty, its
   anomalously youthful cheeks, its burning eyes, its Olympian brow, and
   its shadowing hair and growth of beard.

   Of the progress of time we kept no record, for time had become to us
   the merest illusion. I know only that there must have been something
   very singular involved, since we came at length to marvel why we did
   not grow old. Our discourse was unholy, and always hideously ambitious
   - no god or demon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like
   those which we planned in whispers. I shiver as I speak of them, and
   dare not be explicit; though I will say that my friend once wrote on
   paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue, and which made
   me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the
   spangled night sky. I will hint- only hint- that he had designs which
   involved the rulership of the visible universe and more; designs
   whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command, and the
   destinies of all living things be his. I affirm- I swear- that I had no
   share in these extreme aspirations. Anything my friend may have said or
   written to the contrary must be erroneous, for I am no man of strength
   to risk the unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve
   success.

   There was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us
   irresistibly into limitless vacum beyond all thought and entity.
   Perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon
   us; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy,
   yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of
   presentation to others. Viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid
   succession, and at length I felt that we had been borne to realms of
   greater remoteness than any we had previously known.

   My friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean
   of virgin aether, and I could see the sinister exultation on his
   floating, luminous, too-youthful memory-face. Suddenly that face became
   dim and quickly disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself
   projected against an obstacle which I could not penetrate. It was like
   the others, yet incalculably denser; a sticky clammy mass, if such
   terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a non-material sphere.

   I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had
   successfully passed. Struggling anew, I came to the end of the
   drug-dream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose
   opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my
   fellow dreamer, weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed
   gold-green light on his marble features.

   Then, after a short interval, the form in the corner stirred; and may
   pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that
   which took place before me. I cannot tell you how he shrieked, or what
   vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed
   with fright. I can only say that I fainted, and did not stir till he
   himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away
   the horror and desolation.

   That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.
   Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier
   warned me that we must never venture within those realms again. What he
   had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we
   must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep
   us awake. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear
   which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed.

   After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend
   aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles
   form and hair whiten almost before one's eyes. Our mode of life was now
   totally altered. Heretofore a recluse so far as I know- his true name
   and origin never having passed his lips- my friend now became frantic
   in his fear of solitude. At night he would not be alone, nor would the
   company of a few persons calm him. His sole relief was obtained in
   revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies
   of the young and gay were unknown to us.

   Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which
   I keenly resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than
   solitude. Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the
   stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often
   glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing
   therein. He did not always glance at the same place in the sky- it
   seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings
   it would be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly
   overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it
   would be in the east, but mostly if in the small hours of morning.

   Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two years
   did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began
   to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault
   whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his
   glance- a spot roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis.

   We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing
   the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world.
   We were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous
   overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become
   snow-white. Our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did
   we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had
   now grown so frightful a menace.

   Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs
   were hard to buy. My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had
   no means to purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had
   I possessed them. We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my
   friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken
   him. I can recall the scene now- the desolate, pitch-black garret
   studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of our
   lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the
   dressing-table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part
   of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space;
   and, worst of all, the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on
   the couch- a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of
   supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres
   forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote.

   The tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial
   impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind.
   I heard a clock strike somewhere- not ours, for that was not a striking
   clock- and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle
   wanderings. Clocks- time- space- infinity- and then my fancy reverted
   to the locale as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog
   and the rain and the atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the
   northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend had appeared to dread, and
   whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen
   through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my feverishly
   sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in
   the soft medley of drug-magnified sounds- a low and damnably insistent
   whine from very far away; droning, clamoring, mocking, calling, from
   the northeast.

   But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and
   set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed;
   not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which
   caused lodgers and police to break down the door. It was not what I
   heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and
   curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft
   of horrible red-gold light- a shaft which bore with it no glow to
   disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head
   of the troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the
   luminous and strangely youthful memory-face as I had known it in dreams
   of abysmal space and unshackled time, when my friend had pushed behind
   the barrier to those secret, innermost and forbidden caverns of
   nightmare.

   And as I looked, I beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and
   deep-sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if
   for a scream too frightful to be uttered. There dwelt in that ghastly
   and flexible face, as it shone bodiless, luminous, and rejuvenated in
   the blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain-shattering fear than all
   the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me.

   No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and
   nearer, but as I followed the memory-face's mad stare along that cursed
   shaft of light to its source, the source whence also the whining came,
   I, too, saw for an instant what it saw, and fell with ringing ears in
   that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the
   police. Never could I tell, try as I might, what it actually was that I
   saw; nor could the still face tell, for although it must have seen more
   than I did, it will never speak again. But always I shall guard against
   the mocking and insatiate Hypnos, lord of sleep, against the night sky,
   and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy.

   Just what happened is unknown, for not only was my own mind unseated by
   the strange and hideous thing, but others were tainted with a
   forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness. They have said, I
   know not for what reason, that I never had a friend; but that art,
   philosophy, and insanity had filled all my tragic life. The lodgers and
   police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something
   to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place.
   My stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the
   couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and
   now a fame which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald,
   gray-bearded, shriveled, palsied, drug-crazed, and broken, adoring and
   praying to the object they found.

   For they deny that I sold the last of my statuary, and point with
   ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold,
   petrified, and unvocal. It is all that remains of my friend; the friend
   who led me on to madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as
   only old Hellas could yield, young with the youth that is outside time,
   and with beauteous bearded face, curved, smiling lips, Olympian brow,
   and dense locks waving and poppy-crowned. They say that that haunting
   memory-face is modeled from my own, as it was at twenty-five; but upon
   the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of Attica -
   HYPNOS.

   Ibid  (1938)
   by Howard Phillips Lovecraft

    Written 1927/1928, published January 1938 in O-Wash-Ta-Nong, 3, No. 1

   70603IbidHoward Phillips Lovecraft1938

     "...as Ibid says in his famous Lives of the Poets."

                                                    -From a student theme.

   The erroneous idea that Ibid is the author of the Lives is so
   frequently met with, even among those pretending to a degree of
   culture, that it is worth correcting. It should be a matter of general
   knowledge that Cf. is responsible for this work. Ibid's masterpiece, on
   the other hand, was the famous Op. Cit. wherein all the significant
   undercurrents of Graeco-Roman expression were crystallised once for all
   - and with admirable acuteness, notwithstanding the surprisingly late
   date at which Ibid wrote. There is a false report- very commonly
   reproduced in modern books prior to Von Schweinkopf's monumental
   Geschichte der Ostrogothen in Italien- that Ibid was a Romanised
   Visigoth of Ataulf's horde who settled in Placentia about 410 A. D. The
   contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for Von Schweinkopf, and
   since his time Littlewit1 and Bêtenoir, 2 have shewn with irrefutable
   force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine Roman- or at
   least as genuine a Roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could
   produce- of whom one might well say what Gibbon said of Boethius, "that
   he was the last whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their
   countryman." He was, like Boethius and nearly all the eminent men of
   his age, of the great Anician family, and traced his genealogy with
   much exactitude and self-satisfaction to all the heroes of the
   republic. His full name - long and pompous according to the custom of
   an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic Roman
   nomenclature - is stated by Von Schweinkopf3 to have been Caius Anicius
   Magnus Furius Camillus Aemilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius
   Ibidus; though Littlewit4 rejects Aemilianus and adds Claudius
   Deciusfunianus; whilst Bêtenoir5 differs radically, giving the full
   name as Magnus Furius Camillus Aurelius Antoninus Flavius Anicius
   Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus.

   The eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486, shortly
   after the extinction of the Roman rule in Gaul by Clovis. Rome and
   Ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain
   that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the
   schools of Athens - the extent of whose suppression by Theodosius a
   century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial. In 512, under
   the benign rule of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, we behold him as a teacher
   of rhetoric at Rome, and in 516 he held the consulship together with
   Pompilius Numantius Bombastes Marcellinus Deodamnatus. Upon the death
   of Theodoric in 526, Ibidus retired from public life to compose his
   celebrated work (whose pure Ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of
   classic atavism as is the verse of Claudius Claudianus, who flourished
   a century before Ibidus); but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp
   to act as court rhetorician for Theodatus, nephew of Theodoric.

   Upon the usurpation of Vitiges, Ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a
   time imprisoned; but the coming of the Byzantine-Roman army under
   Belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours. Throughout the
   siege of Rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders, and
   afterward followed the eagles of Belisarius to Alba, Porto, and
   Centumcellae. After the Frankish siege of Milan, Ibidus was chosen to
   accompany the learned Bishop Datius to Greece, and resided with him at
   Corinth in the year 539. About 541 he removed to Constantinopolis,
   where he received every mark of imperial favour both from Justinianus
   and Justinus the Second. The Emperors Tiberius and Maurice did kindly
   honour to his old age, and contributed much to his immortality -
   especially Maurice, whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old
   Rome notwithstanding his birth at Arabiscus, in Cappadocia. It was
   Maurice who, in the poet's 101st year, secured the adoption of his work
   as a textbook in the schools of the empire, an honour which proved a
   fatal tax on the aged rhetorician's emotions, since he passed away
   peacefully at his home near the church of St. Sophia on the sixth day
   before the Kalends of September, A. D. 587, in the 102nd year of his
   age.

   His remains, notwithstanding the troubled state of Italy, were taken to
   Ravenna for interment; but being interred in the suburb of Classe, were
   exhumed and ridiculed by the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, who took his
   skull to King Autharis for use as a wassail-bowl. Ibid's skull was
   proudly handed down from king to king of the Lombard line. Upon the
   capture of Pavia by Charlemagne in 774, the skull was seized from the
   tottering Desiderius and carried in the train of the Frankish
   conqueror. It was from this vessel, indeed, that Pope Leo administered
   the royal unction which made of the hero-nomad a Holy Roman Emperor.
   Charlemagne took Ibid's skull to his capital at Aix, soon after- ward
   presenting it to his Saxon teacher Alcuin, upon whose death in 804 it
   was sent to Alcuin's kinsfolk in England.

   William the Conqueror, finding it in an abbey niche where the pious
   family of Alcuin had placed it (believing it to be the skull of a
   saint6 who had miraculously annihilated the Lombards by his prayers),
   did reverence to its osseous antiquity; and even the rough soldiers of
   Cromwell, upon destroying Ballylough Abbey in Ireland in 1650 (it
   having been secretly transported thither by a devout Papist in 1539,
   upon Henry VII's dissolution of the English monasteries), declined to
   offer violence to a relic so venerable.

   It was captured by the private soldier Read-'em-and-Weep Hopkins, who
   not long after traded it to Rest-in-Jehovah Stubbs for a quid of new
   Virginia weed. Stubbs, upon sending forth his son Zerubbabel to seek
   his fortune in New England in 1661 (for he thought ill of the
   Restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman), gave him St. Ibid's -
   or rather Brother Ibid's, for he abhorred all that was Popish - skull
   as a talisman. Upon landing in Salem Zerubbabel set it up in his
   cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the
   town pump. However, he had not been wholly unaffected by the
   Restoration influence; and having become addicted to gaming, lost the
   skull to one Epenetus Dexter, a visiting freeman of Providence.

   It was in the house of Dexter, in the northern part of the town near
   the present intersection of North Main and Olney Streets, on the
   occasion of Canonchet's raid of March 30, 1676, during King Philip's
   War; and the astute sachem, recognising it at once as a thing of
   singular venerableness and dignity, sent it as a symbol of alliance to
   a faction of the Pequots in Connecticut with whom he was negotiating.
   On April 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed,
   but the austere head of Ibid continued on its wanderings.

   The Pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken
   Narragansetts no assistance; and in 1680 a Dutch furtrader of Albany,
   Petrus van Schaack, secured the distinguished cranium for the modest
   sum of two guilders, he having recognised its value from the
   half-effaced inscription carved in Lombardic minuscules (palaeography,
   it might be explained, was one of the leading accomplishments of
   New-Netherland fur-traders of the seventeenth century).

   From van Schaack, sad to say, the relic was stolen in 1683 by a French
   trader, Jean Grenier, whose Popish zeal recognised the features of one
   whom he had been taught at his mother's knee to revere as St. Ibide.
   Grenier, fired with virtuous rage at the possession of this holy symbol
   by a Protestant, crushed van Schaack's head one night with an axe and
   escaped to the north with his booty; soon, however, being robbed and
   slain by the half-breed voyageur Michel Savard, who took the skull -
   despite the illiteracy which prevented his recognising it - to add to a
   collection of similar but more recent material.

   Upon his death in 1701 his half-breed son Pierre traded it among other
   things to some emissaries of the Sacs and Foxes, and it was found
   outside the chief's tepee a generation later by Charles de Langlade,
   founder of the trading post at Green Bay, Wisconsin. De Langlade
   regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at
   the expense of many glass beads; yet after his time it found itself in
   many other hands, being traded to settlements at the head of Lake
   Winnebago, to tribes around Lake Mendota, and finally, early in the
   nineteenth century, to one Solomon Juneau, a Frenchman, at the new
   trading post of Milwaukee on the Menominee River and the shore of Lake
   Michigan.

   Later traded to Jacques Caboche, another settler, it was in 1850 lost
   in a game of chess or poker to a newcomer named Hans Zimmerman; being
   used by him as a beer-stein until one day, under the spell of its
   contents, he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie
   path before his home - where, falling into the burrow of a prairie-dog,
   it passed beyond his power of discovery or recovery upon his awaking.

   So for generations did the sainted skull of Caius Anicius Magnus Furius
   Camillus Aemilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus, consul
   of Rome, favourite of emperors, and saint of the Romish church, lie
   hidden beneath the soil of a growing town. At first worshipped with
   dark rites by the prairie-dogs, who saw in it a deity sent from the
   upper world, it afterward fell into dire neglect as the race of simple,
   artless burrowers succumbed before the onslaught of the conquering
   Aryan. Sewers came, but they passed by it. Houses went up - 2303 of
   them, and more - and at last one fateful night a titan thing occurred.
   Subtle Nature, convulsed with a spiritual ecstasy, like the froth of
   that region's quondam beverage, laid low the lofty and heaved high the
   humble - and behold! In the roseal dawn the burghers of Milwaukee rose
   to find a former prairie turned to a highland! Vast and far-reaching
   was the great upheaval. Subterrene arcana, hidden for years, came at
   last to the light. For there, full in the rifted roadway, lay bleached
   and tranquil in bland, saintly, and consular pomp the dome-like skull
   of Ibid!

   There is nothing more absurd, as I view it, than that conventional
   association of the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the
   psychology of the multitude. Mention a bucolic Yankee setting, a
   bungling and thick-fibred village undertaker, and a careless mishap in
   a tomb, and no average reader can be brought to expect more than a
   hearty albeit grotesque phase of comedy. God knows, though, that the
   prosy tale which George Birch's death permits me to tell has in it
   aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light.

   Birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881, yet never
   discussed the case when he could avoid it. Neither did his old
   physician Dr. Davis, who died years ago. It was generally stated that
   the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby Birch
   had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of Peck Valley
   Cemetery, escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means; but
   while this much was undoubtedly true, there were other and blacker
   things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium
   toward the last. He confided in me because I was his doctor, and
   because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after
   Davis died. He was a bachelor, wholly without relatives.

   Birch, before 1881, had been the village undertaker of Peck Valley; and
   was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go.
   The practices I heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today, at
   least in a city; and even Peck Valley would have shuddered a bit had it
   known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters
   as the ownership of costly "laying-out" apparel invisible beneath the
   casket's lid, and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and
   adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not
   always calculated with sublimest accuracy. Most distinctly Birch was
   lax, insensitive, and professionally undesirable; yet I still think he
   was not an evil man. He was merely crass of fibre and function-
   thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident
   proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average
   citizen within certain limits fixed by taste.

   Just where to begin Birch's story I can hardly decide, since I am no
   practiced teller of tales. I suppose one should start in the cold
   December of 1880, when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found
   they could dig no more graves till spring. Fortunately the village was
   small and the death rate low, so that it was possible to give all of
   Birch's inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated
   receiving tomb. The undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter
   weather, and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness. Never did he
   knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets, or disregard more
   flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he
   slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandon.

   At last the spring thaw came, and graves were laboriously prepared for
   the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb.
   Birch, though dreading the bother of removal and interment, began his
   task of transference one disagreeable April morning, but ceased before
   noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse, after
   having laid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest. That was
   Darius Peck, the nonagenarian, whose grave was not far from the tomb.
   Birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old Matthew
   Fenner, whose grave was also near by; but actually postponed the matter
   for three days, not getting to work till Good Friday, the 15th. Being
   without superstition, he did not heed the day at all; though ever
   afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth
   day of the week. Certainly, the events of that evening greatly changed
   George Birch.

   On the afternoon of Friday, April 15th, then, Birch set out for the
   tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of Matthew Fenner. That
   he was not perfectly sober, he subsequently admitted; though he had not
   then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget
   certain things. He was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his
   sensitive horse, which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed
   and pawed and tossed its head, much as on that former occasion when the
   rain had vexed it. The day was clear, but a high wind had sprung up;
   and Birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and
   entered the side-hill vault. Another might not have relished the damp,
   odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins; but Birch in
   those days was insensitive, and was concerned only in getting the right
   coffin for the right grave. He had not forgotten the criticism aroused
   when Hannah Bixby's relatives, wishing to transport her body to the
   cemetery in the city whither they had moved, found the casket of Judge
   Capwell beneath her headstone.

   The light was dim, but Birch's sight was good, and he did not get Asaph
   Sawyer's coffin by mistake, although it was very similar. He had,
   indeed, made that coffin for Matthew Fenner; but had cast it aside at
   last as too awkward and flimsy, in a fit of curious sentimentality
   aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had
   been to him during his bankruptcy five years before. He gave old Matt
   the very best his skill could produce, but was thrifty enough to save
   the rejected specimen, and to use it when Asaph Sawyer died of a
   malignant fever. Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were
   told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for
   wrongs real or fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunction in
   assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way
   in his quest for the Fenner casket.

   It was just as he had recognised old Matt's coffin that the door
   slammed to in the wind, leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before.
   The narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays, and the overhead
   ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that he was reduced to a
   profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward
   the latch. In this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles,
   pushed at the iron panels, and wondered why the massive portal had
   grown so suddenly recalcitrant. In this twilight too, he began to
   realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do
   more than neigh an unsympathetic reply. For the long-neglected latch
   was obviously broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the
   vault, a victim of his own oversight.

   The thing must have happened at about three-thirty in the afternoon.
   Birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout
   long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled
   seeing in a corner of the tomb. It is doubtful whether he was touched
   at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position, but the
   bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough
   to exasperate him thoroughly. His day's work was sadly interrupted, and
   unless chance presently brought some rambler hither, he might have to
   remain all night or longer. The pile of tools soon reached, and a
   hammer and chisel selected, Birch returned over the coffins to the
   door. The air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this
   detail he paid no attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy
   and corroded metal of the latch. He would have given much for a lantern
   or bit of candle; but lacking these, bungled semi-sightlessly as best
   he might.

   When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to
   such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these, Birch
   glanced about for other possible points of escape. The vault had been
   dug from a hillside, so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top
   ran through several feet of earth, making this direction utterly
   useless to consider. Over the door, however, the high, slit-like
   transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a
   diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his
   brains for means to reach it. There was nothing like a ladder in the
   tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear- which Birch seldom
   took the trouble to use- afforded no ascent to the space above the
   door. Only the coffins themselves remained as potential
   stepping-stones, and as he considered these he speculated on the best
   mode of transporting them. Three coffin-heights, he reckoned, would
   permit him to reach the transom; but he could do better with four. The
   boxes were fairly even, and could be piled up like blocks; so he began
   to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable
   platform four deep. As he planned, he could not but wish that the units
   of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made. Whether he
   had imagination enough to wish they were empty, is strongly to be
   doubted.

   Finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall, to
   place upon this two layers of two each, and upon these a single box to
   serve as the platform. This arrangement could be ascended with a
   minimum of awkwardness, and would furnish the desired height. Better
   still, though, he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support
   the superstructure, leaving one free to be piled on top in case the
   actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude. And so the
   prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of
   mortality with little ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose
   course by course. Several of the coffins began to split under the
   stress of handling, and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of
   little Matthew Fenner for the top, in order that his feet might have as
   certain a surface as possible. In the semi-gloom he trusted mostly to
   touch to select the right one, and indeed came upon it almost by
   accident, since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd
   volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third
   layer.

   The tower at length finished, and his aching arms rested by a pause
   during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device, Birch
   cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow
   transom. The borders of the space were entirely of brick, and there
   seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to
   allow his body to pass. As his hammer blows began to fall, the horse
   outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and to
   others may have been mocking. In either case it would have been
   appropriate; for the unexpected tenacity of the easy-looking brickwork
   was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the
   source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus.

   Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling. He worked largely by feeling
   now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was
   still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the
   top and bottom of the aperture. He could, he was sure, get out by
   midnight- though it is characteristic of him that this thought was
   untinged with eerie implications. Undisturbed by oppressive reflections
   on the time, the place, and the company beneath his feet, he
   philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a
   fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the
   increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree. In time
   the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and
   then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and
   creaked. He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform
   to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level
   to use as soon as its size might permit.

   It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get
   through the transom. Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he
   descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather
   strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside. The
   hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he
   vaguely wished it would stop. He was curiously unelated over his
   impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for his form had the
   indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting
   coffins he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon
   reaching the topmost one, he heard that aggravated crackle which
   bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood. He had, it seems, planned in
   vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner
   was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way, jouncing
   him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine.
   Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even to
   the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for
   a neigh, and plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling
   crazily behind it.

   Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble
   out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined
   try. Clutching the edges of the aperture, he sought to pull himself up,
   when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on
   both his ankles. In another moment he knew fear for the first time that
   night; for struggle as he would, he could not shake clear of the
   unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity. Horrible
   pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves; and in his mind
   was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that
   suggested splinters, loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking
   wooden box. Perhaps he screamed. At any rate he kicked and squirmed
   frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost
   eclipsed in a half-swoon.

   Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the
   crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground. He could not
   walk, it appeared, and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible
   sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge; his
   fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste, and his body
   responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when
   chased by the phantoms of nightmare. There was evidently, however, no
   pursuer; for he was alone and alive when Armington, the lodge-keeper,
   answered his feeble clawing at the door.

   Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his
   little son Edwin for Dr. Davis. The afflicted man was fully conscious,
   but would say nothing of any consequence; merely muttering such things
   as "Oh, my ankles!", "Let go!", or "Shut in the tomb". Then the doctor
   came with his medicine-case and asked crisp questions, and removed the
   patient's outer clothing, shoes, and socks. The wounds- for both ankles
   were frightfully lacerated about the Achilles' tendons- seemed to
   puzzle the old physician greatly, and finally almost to frighten him.
   His questioning grew more than medically tense, and his hands shook as
   he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get the
   wounds out of sight as quickly as possible.

   For an impersonal doctor, Davis' ominous and awestruck
   cross-examination became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from
   the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience.
   He was oddly anxious to know if Birch were sure- absolutely sure- of
   the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how he had chosen it, how
   he had been certain of it as the Fenner coffin in the dusk, and how he
   had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious
   Asaph Sawyer. Would the firm Fenner casket have caved in so readily?
   Davis, an old-time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the
   respective funerals, as indeed he had attended both Fenner and Sawyer
   in their last illnesses. He had even wondered, at Sawyer's funeral, how
   the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely
   akin to that of the diminutive Fenner.

   After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all
   times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and
   splintering wood. What else, he added, could ever in any case be proved
   or believed? But it would be well to say as little as could be said,
   and to let no other doctor treat the wounds. Birch heeded this advice
   all the rest of his life till he told me his story; and when I saw the
   scars- ancient and whitened as they then were- I agreed that he was
   wise in so doing. He always remained lame, for the great tendons had
   been severed; but I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His
   thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become
   ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to
   certain chance allusions such as "Friday", "Tomb", "Coffin", and words
   of less obvious concatenation. His frightened horse had gone home, but
   his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed his business, but
   something always preyed upon him. It may have been just fear, and it
   may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for
   bygone crudities. His drinking, of course, only aggravated what it was
   meant to alleviate.

   When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to
   the old receiving tomb. The moon was shining on the scattered brick
   fragments and marred facade, and the latch of the great door yielded
   readily to a touch from the outside. Steeled by old ordeals in
   dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the
   nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced. He
   cried aloud once, and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible
   than a cry. Then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of
   his calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a
   succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears
   like the hissing of vitriol.

   "It was Asaph's coffin, Birch, just as I thought! I knew his teeth,
   with the front ones missing on the upper jaw- never, for God's sake,
   show those wounds! The body was pretty badly gone, but if ever I saw
   vindictiveness on any face- or former face... You know what a fiend he
   was for revenge- how he ruined old Raymond thirty years after their
   boundary suit, and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a
   year ago last August... He was the devil incarnate, Birch, and I
   believe his eye-for-an-eye fury could beat old Father Death himself.
   God, what a rage! I'd hate to have it aimed at me!

   "Why did you do it, Birch? He was a scoundrel, and I don't blame you
   for giving him a cast-aside coffin, but you always did go too damned
   far! Well enough to skimp on the thing some way, but you knew what a
   little man old Fenner was.

   "I'll never get the picture out of my head as long as I live. You
   kicked hard, for Asaph's coffin was on the floor. His head was broken
   in, and everything was tumbled about. I've seen sights before, but
   there was one thing too much here. An eye for an eye! Great heavens,
   Birch, but you got what you deserved. The skull turned my stomach, but
   the other was worse- those ankles cut neatly off to fit Matt Fenner's
   cast-aside coffin!"

   Before I try to rest I will set down these notes in preparation for the
   report I must make. What I have found is so singular, and so contrary
   to all past experience and expectations, that it deserves a very
   careful description.

   I reached the main landing on Venus, March 18, terrestrial time; VI, 9
   of the planet's calendar. Being put in the main group under Miller, I
   received my equipment - watch tuned to Venus's slightly quicker
   rotation - and went through the usual mask drill. After two days I was
   pronounced fit for duty.

   Leaving the Crystal Company's post at Terra Nova around dawn, VI, 12, I
   followed the southerly route which Anderson had mapped out from the
   air. The going was bad, for these jungles are always half impassable
   after a rain. It must be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and
   creepers that leathery toughness; a toughness so great that a knife has
   to work ten minutes on some of them. By noon it was dryer - the
   vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that my knife went through it
   easily - but even then I could not make much speed. These Carter oxygen
   masks are too heavy - just carrying one half wears an ordinary man out.
   A Dubois mask with sponge-reservoir instead of tubes would give just as
   good air at half the weight.

   The crystal-detector seemed to function well, pointing steadily in a
   direction verifying Anderson's report. It is curious how that principle
   of affinity works - without any of the fakery of the old 'divining
   rods' back home. There must be a great deposit of crystals within a
   thousand miles, though I suppose those damnable man-lizards always
   watch and guard it. Possibly they think we are just as foolish for
   coming to Venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for grovelling
   in the mud whenever they see a piece of it, or for keeping that great
   mass on a pedestal in their temple. I wish they'd get a new religion,
   for they have no use for the crystals except to pray to. Barring
   theology, they would let us take all we want - and even if they learned
   to tap them for power there'd be more than enough for their planet and
   the earth besides. I for one am tired of passing up the main deposits
   and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle river-beds. Sometime
   I'll urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff army
   from home. About twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn
   the trick. One can't call the damned things men for all their 'cities'
   and towers. They haven't any skill except building - and using swords
   and poison darts - and I don't believe their so-called 'cities' mean
   much more than ant-hills or beaver-dams. I doubt if they even have a
   real language - all the talk about psychological communication through
   those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk. What misleads
   people is their upright posture; just an accidental physical
   resemblance to terrestrial man.

   I'd like to go through a Venus jungle for once without having to watch
   out for skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts. They may
   have been all right before we began to take the crystals, but they're
   certainly a bad enough nuisance now - with their dart-shooting and
   their cutting of our water pipes. More and more I come to believe that
   they have a special sense like our crystal-detectors. No one ever knew
   them to bother a man - apart from long-distance sniping - who didn't
   have crystals on him.

   Around 1 P.M. a dart nearly took my helmet off, and I thought for a
   second one of my oxygen tubes was punctured. The sly devils hadn't made
   a sound, but three of them were closing in on me. I got them all by
   sweeping in a circle with my flame pistol, for even though their colour
   blended with the jungle, I could spot the moving creepers. One of them
   was fully eight feet tall, with a snout like a tapir's. The other two
   were average seven-footers. All that makes them hold their own is sheer
   numbers - even a single regiment of flame throwers could raise hell
   with them. It is curious, though, how they've come to be dominant on
   the planet. Not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans
   and skorahs, or the flying tukahs of the other continent - unless of
   course those holes in the Dionaean Plateau hide something.

   About two o'clock my detector veered westward, indicating isolated
   crystals ahead on the right. This checked up with Anderson, and I
   turned my course accordingly. It was harder going - not only because
   the ground was rising, but because the animal life and carnivorous
   plants were thicker. I was always slashing ugrats and stepping on
   skorahs, and my leather suit was all speckled from the bursting darohs
   which struck it from all sides. The sunlight was all the worse because
   of the mist, and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least. Every
   time I stepped my feet sank down five or six inches, and there was a
   sucking sort of blup every time I pulled them out. I wish somebody
   would invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this
   climate. Cloth of course would rot; but some thin metallic tissue that
   couldn't tear - like the surface of this revolving decay-proof record
   scroll - ought to be feasible sometime.

   I ate about 3:30 - if slipping these wretched food tablets through my
   mask can be called eating. Soon after that I noticed a decided change
   in the landscape - the bright, poisonous-looking flowers shifting in
   colour and getting wraith-like. The outlines of everything shimmered
   rhythmically, and bright points of light appeared and danced in the
   same slow, steady tempo. After that the temperature seemed to fluctuate
   in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drumming.

   The whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep, regular pulsations
   that filled every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind
   alike. I lost all sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily, nor did
   it change things in the least when I shut my eyes and covered my ears
   with my hands. However, my mind was still clear, and in a very few
   minutes I realized what had happened.

   I had encountered at last one of those curious mirage-plants about
   which so many of our men told stories. Anderson had warned me of them,
   and described their appearance very closely - the shaggy stalk, the
   spiky leaves, and the mottled blossoms whose gaseous, dream-breeding
   exhalations penetrate every existing make of mask.

   Recalling what happened to Bailey three years ago, I fell into a
   momentary panic, and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy,
   chaotic world which the plant's exhalations had woven around me. Then
   good sense came back, and I realized all I need do was retreat from the
   dangerous blossoms - heading away from the source of the pulsations,
   and cutting a path blindly - regardless of what might seem to swirl
   around me - until safely out of the plant's effective radius.

   Although everything was spinning perilously, I tried to start in the
   right direction and hack my way ahead. My route must have been far from
   straight, for it seemed hours before I was free of the mirage-plant's
   pervasive influence. Gradually the dancing lights began to disappear,
   and the shimmering spectral scenery began to assume the aspect of
   solidity. When I did get wholly clear I looked at my watch and was
   astonished to find that the time was only 4:20. Though eternities had
   seemed to pass, the whole experience could have consumed little more
   than a half-hour.

   Every delay, however, was irksome, and I had lost ground in my retreat
   from the plant. I now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by
   the crystal-detector, bending every energy toward making better time.
   The jungle was still thick, though there was less animal life. Once a
   carnivorous blossom engulfed my right foot and held it so tightly that
   I had to hack it free with my knife; reducing the flower to strips
   before it let go.

   In less than an hour I saw that the jungle growths were thinning out,
   and by five o'clock - after passing through a belt of tree-ferns with
   very little underbrush - I emerged on a broad mossy plateau. My
   progress now became rapid, and I saw by the wavering of my
   detector-needle that I was getting relatively close to the crystal I
   sought. This was odd, for most of the scattered, egg-like spheroids
   occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this
   treeless upland.

   The terrain sloped upward, ending in a definite crest. I reached the
   top about 5:30 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests
   in the distance. This, without question, was the plateau mapped by
   Matsugawa from the air fifty years ago, and called on our maps 'Eryx'
   or the 'Erycinian Highland.' But what made my heart leap was a smaller
   detail, whose position could not have been far from the plain's exact
   centre. It was a single point of light, blazing through the mist and
   seeming to draw a piercing, concentrated luminescence from the
   yellowish, vapour-dulled sunbeams. This, without doubt, was the crystal
   I sought - a thing possibly no larger than a hen's egg, yet containing
   enough power to keep a city warm for a year. I could hardly wonder, as
   I glimpsed the distant glow, that those miserable man-lizards worship
   such crystals. And yet they have not the least notion of the powers
   they contain.

   Breaking into a rapid run, I tried to reach the unexpected prize as
   soon as possible; and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a
   thin, singularly detestable mud studded with occasional patches of
   weeds and creepers. But I splashed on heedlessly - scarcely thinking to
   look around for any of the skulking man-lizards. In this open space I
   was not very likely to be waylaid. As I advanced, the light ahead
   seemed to grow in size and brilliancy, and I began to notice some
   peculiarity in its situation. Clearly, this was a crystal of the very
   finest quality, and my elation grew with every spattering step.

   It is now that I must begin to be careful in making my report, since
   what I shall henceforward have to say involves unprecedented - though
   fortunately verifiable - matters. I was racing ahead with mounting
   eagerness, and had come within a hundred yards or so of the crystal -
   whose position on a sort of raised place in the omnipresent slime
   seemed very odd - when a sudden, overpowering force struck my chest and
   the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward into the
   mud. The splash of my fall was terrific, nor did the softness of the
   ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head
   from a bewildering jarring. For a moment I lay supine, too utterly
   startled to think. Then I half mechanically stumbled to my feet and
   began to scrape the worst of the mud and scum from my leather suit.

   Of what I had encountered I could not form the faintest idea. I had
   seen nothing which could have caused the shock, and I saw nothing now.
   Had I, after all, merely slipped in the mud? My sore knuckles and
   aching chest forbade me to think so. Or was this whole incident an
   illusion brought on by some hidden mirage-plant? It hardly seemed
   probable, since I had none of the usual symptoms, and since there was
   no place near by where so vivid and typical a growth could lurk unseen.
   Had I been on the earth, I would have suspected a barrier of N-force
   laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone, but in this
   humanless region such a notion would have been absurd.

   Finally pulling myself together, I decided to investigate in a cautious
   way. Holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me, so that it might
   be first to feel the strange force, I started once more for the shining
   crystal - preparing to advance step by step with the greatest
   deliberation. At the third step I was brought up short by the impact of
   the knife - point on an apparently solid surface - a solid surface
   where my eyes saw nothing.

   After a moment's recoil I gained boldness. Extending my gloved left
   hands I verified the presence of invisible solid matter - or a tactile
   illusion of solid matter - ahead of me. Upon moving my hand I found
   that the barrier was of substantial extent, and of an almost glassy
   smoothness, with no evidence of the joining of separate blocks. Nerving
   myself for further experiments, I removed a glove and tested the thing
   with my bare hand. It was indeed hard and glassy, and of a curious
   coldness as contrasted with the air around. I strained my eyesight to
   the utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing
   substance, but could discern nothing whatsoever. There was not even any
   evidence of refractive power as judged by the aspect of the landscape
   ahead. Absence of reflective power was proved by the lack of a glowing
   image of the sun at any point.

   Burning curiosity began to displace all other feelings, and I enlarged
   my investigations as best I could. Exploring with my hands, I found
   that the barrier extended from the ground to some level higher than I
   could reach, and that it stretched off indefinitely on both sides. It
   was, then, a wall of some kind - though all guesses as to its materials
   and its purpose were beyond me. Again I thought of the mirage-plant and
   the dreams it induced, but a moment's reasoning put this out of my
   head.

   Knocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife, and kicking
   at it with my heavy boots, I tried to interpret the sounds thus made.
   There was something suggestive of cement or concrete in these
   reverberations, though my hands had found the surface more glassy or
   metallic in feel. Certainly, I was confronting something strange beyond
   all previous experience.

   The next logical move was to get some idea of the wall's dimensions.
   The height problem would be hard, if not insoluble, but the length and
   shape problem could perhaps be sooner dealt with. Stretching out my
   arms and pressing close to the barrier, I began to edge gradually to
   the left - keeping very careful track of the way I faced. After several
   steps I concluded that the wall was not straight, but that I was
   following part of some vast circle or ellipse. And then my attention
   was distracted by something wholly different - something connected with
   the still-distant crystal which had formed the object of my quest.

   I have said that even from a great distance the shining object's
   position seemed indefinably queer - on a slight mound rising from the
   slime. Now - at about a hundred yards - I could see plainly despite the
   engulfing mist just what that mound was. It was the body of a man in
   one of the Crystal Company's leather suits, lying on his back, and with
   his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few inches away. In his right
   hand, crushed convulsively against his chest, was the crystal which had
   led me here - a spheroid of incredible size, so large that the dead
   fingers could scarcely close over it. Even at the given distance I
   could see that the body was a recent one. There was little visible
   decay, and I reflected that in this climate such a thing meant death
   not more than a day before. Soon the hateful farnoth-flies would begin
   to cluster about the corpse. I wondered who the man was. Surely no one
   I had seen on this trip. It must have been one of the old-timers absent
   on a long roving commission, who had come to this especial region
   independently of Anderson's survey. There he lay, past all trouble, and
   with the rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his
   stiffened fingers.

   For fully five minutes I stood there staring in bewilderment and
   apprehension. A curious dread assailed me, and I had an unreasonable
   impulse to run away. It could not have been done by those slinking
   man-lizards, for he still held the crystal he had found. Was there any
   connexion with the invisible wall? Where had he found the crystal?
   Anderson's instrument had indicated one in this quarter well before
   this man could have perished. I now began to regard the unseen barrier
   as something sinister, and recoiled from it with a shudder. Yet I knew
   I must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of
   this recent tragedy.

   Suddenly - wrenching my mind back to the problem I faced - I thought of
   a possible means of testing the wall's height, or at least of finding
   whether or not it extended indefinitely upward. Seizing a handful of
   mud, I let it drain until it gained some coherence and then flung it
   high in the air toward the utterly transparent barrier. At a height of
   perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible surface with a resounding
   splash, disintegrating at once and oozing downward in disappearing
   streams with surprising rapidity. Plainly, the wall was a lofty one. A
   second handful, hurled at an even sharper angle, hit the surface about
   eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the first.

   I now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful
   as high as I possibly could. Letting the mud drain, and squeezing it to
   maximum dryness, I flung it up so steeply that I feared it might not
   reach the obstructing surface at all. It did, however, and this time it
   crossed the barrier and fell in the mud beyond with a violent
   spattering. At last I had a rough idea of the height of the wall, for
   the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or twenty-one feet
   aloft.

   With a nineteen - or twenty-foot vertical wall of glassy flatness,
   ascent was clearly impossible. I must, then, continue to circle the
   barrier in the hope of finding a gate, an ending, or some sort of
   interruption. Did the obstacle form a complete round or other closed
   figure, or was it merely an arc or semi-circle? Acting on my decision,
   I resumed my slow leftward circling, moving my hands up and down over
   the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or other small
   aperture. Before starting, I tried to mark my position by kicking a
   hole in the mud, but found the slime too thin to hold any impression. I
   did, though, gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in
   the distant forest which seemed just on a line with the gleaming
   crystal a hundred yards away. If no gate or break existed I could now
   tell when I had completely circumnavigated the wall.

   I had not progressed far before I decided that the curvature indicated
   a circular enclosure of about a hundred yards' diameter - provided the
   outline was regular. This would mean that the dead man lay near the
   wall at a point almost opposite the region where I had started. Was he
   just inside or just outside the enclosure? This I would soon ascertain.

   As I slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate, window, or
   other break, I decided that the body was lying within. On closer view
   the features of the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing. I found
   something alarming in his expression, and in the way the glassy eyes
   stared. By the time I was very near I believed I recognized him as
   Dwight, a veteran whom I had never known, but who was pointed out to me
   at the post last year. The crystal he clutched was certainly a prize -
   the largest single specimen I had ever seen.

   I was so near the body that I could - but for the barrier - have
   touched it, when my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the
   unseen surface. In a second I had learned that there was an opening
   about three feet wide, extending from the ground to a height greater
   than I could reach. There was no door, nor any evidence of hingemarks
   bespeaking a former door. Without a moment's hesitation I stepped
   through and advanced two paces to the prostrate body - which lay at
   right angles to the hallway I had entered, in what seemed to be an
   intersecting doorless corridor. It gave me a fresh curiosity to find
   that the interior of this vast enclosure was divided by partitions.

   Bending to examine the corpse, I discovered that it bore no wounds.
   This scarcely surprised me, since the continued presence of the crystal
   argued against the pseudo-reptilian natives. Looking about for some
   possible cause of death, my eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close
   to the body's feet. Here, indeed, was something significant. Without
   this device no human being could breathe the air of Venus for more than
   thirty seconds, and Dwight - if it were he - had obviously lost his.
   Probably it had been carelessly buckled, so that the weight of the
   tubes worked the straps loose - a thing which could not happen with a
   Dubois sponge-reservoir mask. The half-minute of grace had been too
   short to allow the man to stoop and recover his protection - or else
   the cyanogen content of the atmosphere was abnormally high at the time.
   Probably he had been busy admiring the crystal - wherever he may have
   found it. He had, apparently, just taken it from the pouch in his suit,
   for the flap was unbuttoned.

   I now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead
   prospector's fingers - a task which the body's stiffness made very
   difficult. The spheroid was larger than a man's fist, and glowed as if
   alive in the reddish rays of the weltering sun. As I touched the
   gleaming surface I shuddered involuntarily - as if by taking this
   precious object I had transferred to myself the doom which had
   overtaken its earlier bearer. However, my qualms soon passed, and I
   carefully buttoned the crystal into the pouch of my leather suit.
   Superstition has never been one of my failings.

   Placing the man's helmet over his dead, staring face, I straightened up
   and stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the
   great enclosure. All my curiosity about the strange edifice now
   returned, and I racked my brains with speculations regarding its
   material, origin, and purpose. That the hands of men had reared it I
   could not for a moment believe. Our ships first reached Venus only
   seventy-two years ago, and the only human beings on the planet have
   been those at Terra Nova. Nor does human knowledge include any
   perfectly transparent, non-refractive solid such as the substance of
   this building. Prehistoric human invasions of Venus can be pretty well
   ruled out, so that one must turn to the idea of native construction.
   Did a forgotten race of highly-evolved beings precede the man-lizards
   as masters of Venus? Despite their elaborately-built cities, it seemed
   hard to credit the pseudo-reptiles with anything of this kind. There
   must have been another race aeons ago, of which this is perhaps the
   last relique. Or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by future
   expeditions? The purpose of such a structure passes all conjecture -
   but its strange and seemingly non-practical material suggests a
   religious use.

   Realizing my inability to solve these problems, I decided that all I
   could do was to explore the invisible structure itself. That various
   rooms and corridors extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud I
   felt convinced; and I believed that a knowledge of their plan might
   lead to something significant. So, feeling my way back through the
   doorway and edging past the body, I began to advance along the corridor
   toward those interior regions whence the dead man had presumably come.
   Later on I would investigate the hallway I had left.

   Groping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight, I moved slowly
   onward. Soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward
   the centre in ever-diminishing curves. Now and then my touch would
   reveal a doorless intersecting passage, and I several times encountered
   junctions with two, three, and four diverging avenues. In these latter
   cases I always followed the inmost route, which seemed to form a
   continuation of the one I had been traversing. There would be plenty of
   time to examine the branches after I had reached and returned from the
   main regions. I can scarcely describe the strangeness of the experience
   - threading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by
   forgotten hands on an alien planet!

   At last, still stumbling and groping, I felt the corridor end in a
   sizeable open space. Fumbling about, I found I was in a circular
   chamber about ten feet across; and from the position of the dead man
   against certain distant forest landmarks I judged that this chamber lay
   at or near the centre of the edifice. Out of it opened five corridors
   besides the one through which I had entered, but I kept the latter in
   mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on
   the horizon as I stood just within the entrance.

   There was nothing in this room to distinguish it - merely the floor of
   thin mud which was everywhere present. Wondering whether this part of
   the building had any roof, I repeated my experiment with an
   upward-flung handful of mud, and found at once that no covering
   existed. If there had ever been one, it must have fallen long ago, for
   not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet. As I
   reflected, it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently
   primordial structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry, gaps in
   the walls, and other common attributes of dilapidation.

   What was it? What had it ever been? Of what was it made? Why was there
   no evidence of separate blocks in the glassy, bafflingly homogenous
   walls? Why were there no traces of doors, either interior or exterior?
   I knew only that I was in a round, roofless, doorless edifice of some
   hard, smooth, perfectly transparent, non-refractive and non-reflective
   material, a hundred yards in diameter, with many corridors, and with a
   small circular room at the centre. More than this I could never learn
   from a direct investigation.

   I now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the west - a
   golden-ruddy disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the
   mist-clouded trees of the horizon. Plainly, I would have to hurry if I
   expected to choose a sleeping-spot on dry ground before dark. I had
   long before decided to camp for the night on the firm, mossy rim of the
   plateau near the crest whence I had first spied the shining crystal,
   trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the man-lizards.
   It has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of
   two or more, so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours, but
   the really small number of night attacks makes the Company careless
   about such things. Those scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in
   seeing at night, even with curious glow torches.

   Having picked out again the hallway through which I had come, I started
   to return to the structure's entrance. Additional exploration could
   wait for another day. Groping a course as best I could through the
   spiral corridors - with only general sense, memory, and a vague
   recognition of some of the ill-defined weed patches on the plain as
   guides - I soon found myself once more in close proximity to the
   corpse. There were now one or two farnoth flies swooping over the
   helmet-covered face, and I knew that decay was setting in. With a
   futile instinctive loathing I raised my hand to brush away his vanguard
   of the scavengers - when a strange and astonishing thing became
   manifest. An invisible wall, checking the sweep of my arm, told me that
   - notwithstanding my careful retracing of the way - I had not indeed
   returned to the corridor in which the body lay. Instead, I was in a
   parallel hallway, having no doubt taken some wrong turn or fork among
   the intricate passages behind.

   Hoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead, I continued my
   advance, but presently came to a blank wall. I would, then, have to
   return to the central chamber and steer my course anew. Exactly where I
   had made my mistake I could not tell. I glanced at the ground to see if
   by any miracle guiding footprints had remained, but at once realized
   that the thin mud held impressions only for a very few moments. There
   was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre again, and once
   there I carefully reflected on the proper outward course. I had kept
   too far to the right before. This time I must take a more leftward fork
   somewhere - just where, I could decide as I went.

   As I groped ahead a second time I felt quite confident of my
   correctness, and diverged to the left at a junction I was sure I
   remembered. The spiralling continued, and I was careful not to stray
   into any intersecting passages. Soon, however, I saw to my disgust that
   I was passing the body at a considerable distance; this passage
   evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it. In the hope
   that another exit might exist in the half of the wall I had not yet
   explored, I pressed forward for several paces, but eventually came once
   more to a solid barrier. Clearly, the plan of the building was even
   more complicated than I had thought.

   I now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try
   some of the lateral corridors extending toward the body. If I chose
   this second alternative, I would run the risk of breaking my mental
   pattern of where I was; hence I had better not attempt it unless I
   could think of some way of leaving a visible trail behind me. Just how
   to leave a trail would be quite a problem, and I ransacked my mind for
   a solution. There seemed to be nothing about my person which could
   leave a mark on anything, nor any material which I could scatter - or
   minutely subdivide and scatter.

   My pen had no effect on the invisible wall, and I could not lay a trail
   of my precious food tablets. Even had I been willing to spare the
   latter, there would not have been even nearly enough - besides which
   the small pellets would have instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud.
   I searched my pockets for an old-fashioned note-book - often used
   unofficially on Venus despite the quick rotting-rate of paper in the
   planet's atmosphere - whose pages I could tear up and scatter, but
   could find none. It was obviously impossible to tear the tough, thin
   metal of this revolving decay-proof record scroll, nor did my clothing
   offer any possibilities. In Venus's peculiar atmosphere I could not
   safely spare my stout leather suit, and underwear had been eliminated
   because of the climate.

   I tried to smear mud on the smooth, invisible walls after squeezing it
   as dry as possible, but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as
   did the height-testing handfuls I had previously thrown. Finally I drew
   out my knife and attempted to scratch a line on the glassy, phantom
   surface - something I could recognize with my hand, even though I would
   not have the advantage of seeing it from afar. It was useless, however,
   for the blade made not the slightest impression on the baffling,
   unknown material.

   Frustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail, I again sought the round
   central chamber through memory. It seemed easier to act back to this
   room than to steer a definite, predetermined course away from it, and I
   had little difficulty in finding it anew. This time I listed on my
   record scroll every turn I made - drawing a crude hypothetical diagram
   of my route, and marking all diverging corridors. It was, of course,
   maddeningly slow work when everything had to be determined by touch,
   and the possibilities of error were infinite; but I believed it would
   pay in the long run.

   The long twilight of Venus was thick when I reached the central room,
   but I still had hopes of gaining the outside before dark. Comparing my
   fresh diagram with previous recollections, I believed I had located my
   original mistake, so once more set out confidently along the invisible
   hall-ways. I veered further to the left than during my previous
   attempts, and tried to keep track of my turnings on the records scroll
   in case I was still mistaken. In the gathering dusk I could see the dim
   line of the corpse, now the centre of a loathsome cloud of
   farnoth-flies. Before long, no doubt, the mud-dwelling sificlighs would
   be oozing in from the plain to complete the ghastly work. Approaching
   the body with some reluctance I was preparing to step past it when a
   sudden collision with a wall told me I was again astray.

   I now realized plainly that I was lost. The complications of this
   building were too much for offhand solution, and I would probably have
   to do some careful checking before I could hope to emerge. Still, I was
   eager to get to dry ground before total darkness set in; hence I
   returned once more to the centre and began a rather aimless series of
   trials and errors - making notes by the light of my electric lamp. When
   I used this device I noticed with interest that it produced no
   reflection - not even the faintest glistening - in the transparent
   walls around me. I was, however, prepared for this; since the sun had
   at no time formed a gleaming image in the strange material.

   I was still groping about when the dusk became total. A heavy mist
   obscured most of the stars and planets, but the earth was plainly
   visible as a glowing, bluish-green point in the southeast. It was just
   past opposition, and would have been a glorious sight in a telescope. I
   could even make out the moon beside it whenever the vapours momentarily
   thinned. It was now impossible to see the corpse - my only landmark -
   so I blundered back to the central chamber after a few false turns.
   After all, I would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry ground.
   Nothing could be done till daylight, and I might as well make the best
   of it here. Lying down in the mud would not be pleasant, but in my
   leather suit it could be done. On former expeditions I had slept under
   even worse conditions, and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer
   repugnance.

   So here I am, squatting in the slime of the central room and making
   these notes on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp.
   There is something almost humorous in my strange, unprecedented plight.
   Lost in a building without doors - a building which I cannot see! I
   shall doubtless get out early in the morning, and ought to be back at
   Terra Nova with the crystal by late afternoon. It certainly is a beauty
   - with surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp. I have
   just had it out examining it. Despite my fatigue, sleep is slow in
   coming, so I find myself writing at great length. I must stop now. Not
   much danger of being bothered by those cursed natives in this place.
   The thing I like least is the corpse - but fortunately my oxygen mask
   saves me from the worst effects. I am using the chlorate cubes very
   sparingly. Will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in. More
   later.

   LATER - AFTERNOON, VI, 13

   There has been more trouble than I expected. I am still in the
   building, and will have to work quickly and wisely if I expect to rest
   on dry ground tonight. It took me a long time to get to sleep, and I
   did not wake till almost noon today. As it was, I would have slept
   longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze. The corpse was a
   rather bad sight - wriggling with sificlighs, and with a cloud of
   farnoth-flies around it. Something had pushed the helmet away from the
   face, and it was better not to look at it. I was doubly glad of my
   oxygen mask when I thought of the situation.

   At length I shook and brushed myself dry, took a couple of food
   tablets, and put a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of
   the mask. I am using these cubes slowly, but wish I had a larger
   supply. I felt much better after my sleep, and expected to get out of
   the building very shortly.

   Consulting the notes and sketches I had jotted down, I was impressed by
   the complexity of the hallways, and by the possibility that I had made
   a fundamental error. Of the six openings leading out of the central
   space, I had chosen a certain one as that by which I had entered -
   using a sighting-arrangement as a guide. When I stood just within the
   opening, the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in line with a
   particular lepidodendron in the far-off forest. Now it occurred to me
   that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracy - the
   distance of the corpse making its difference of direction in relation
   to the horizon comparatively slight when viewed from the openings next
   to that of my first ingress. Moreover, the tree did not differ as
   distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the horizon.

   Putting the matter to a test, I found to my chagrin that I could not be
   sure which of three openings was the right one. Had I traversed a
   different set of windings at each attempted exit? This time I would be
   sure. It struck me that despite the impossibility of trail-blazing
   there was one marker I could leave. Though I could not spare my suit, I
   could - because of my thick head of hair - spare my helmet; and this
   was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud.
   Accordingly I removed the roughly hemi-spherical device and laid it at
   the entrance of one of the corridors - the right-hand one of the three
   I must try.

   I would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct;
   repeating what I seemed to recall as the proper turns, and constantly
   consulting and making notes. If I did not get out, I would
   systematically exhaust all possible variations; and if these failed, I
   would proceed to cover the avenues extending from the next opening in
   the same way - continuing to the third opening if necessary. Sooner or
   later I could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit, but I must
   use patience. Even at worst, I could scarcely fail to reach the open
   plain in time for a dry night's sleep.

   Immediate results were rather discouraging, though they helped me
   eliminate the right-hand opening in little more than an hour. Only a
   succession of blind alleys, each ending at a great distance from the
   corpse, seemed to branch from this hallway; and I saw very soon that it
   had not figured at all in the previous afternoon's wanderings. As
   before, however, I always found it relatively easy to grope back to the
   central chamber.

   About 1 P.M. I shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began
   to explore the hallways beyond it. At first I thought I recognized the
   turnings, but soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of
   corridors. I could not get near the corpse, and this time seemed cut
   off from the central chamber as well, even though I thought I had
   recorded every move I made. There seemed to be tricky twists and
   crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams, and I
   began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement. While
   patience would of course win in the end, I saw that my searching would
   have to be minute, tireless and long-continued.

   Two o'clock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridors -
   constantly feeling my way, looking alternately at my helmet and at the
   corpse, and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence. I
   cursed the stupidity and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this
   tangle of unseen walls - reflecting that if I had let the thing alone
   and headed back as soon as I had taken the crystal from the body, I
   would even now be safe at Terra Nova.

   Suddenly it occurred to me that I might be able to tunnel under the
   invisible walls with my knife, and thus effect a short cut to the
   outside - or to some outward-leading corridor. I had no means of
   knowing how deep the building's foundations were, but the omnipresent
   mud argued the absence of any floor save the earth. Facing the distant
   and increasingly horrible corpse, I began a course of feverish digging
   with the broad, sharp blade.

   There was about six inches of semi-liquid mud, below which the density
   of the soil increased sharply. This lower soil seemed to be of a
   different colour - a greyish clay rather like the formations near
   Venus's north pole. As I continued downward close to the unseen barrier
   I saw that the ground was getting harder and harder. Watery mud rushed
   into the excavation as fast as I removed the clay, but I reached
   through it and kept on working. If I could bore any kind of a passage
   beneath the wall, the mud would not stop my wriggling out.

   About three feet down, however, the hardness of the soil halted my
   digging seriously. Its tenacity was beyond anything I had encountered
   before, even on this planet, and was linked with an anomalous
   heaviness. My knife had to split and chip the tightly packed clay, and
   the fragments I brought up were like solid stones or bits of metal.
   Finally even this splitting and chipping became impossible, and I had
   to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reach.

   The hour-long attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one, for it used
   up great stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food
   tablet, and to put an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask. It
   has also brought a pause in the day's gropings, for I am still much too
   exhausted to walk. After cleaning my hands and arms of the worst of the
   mud I sat down to write these notes - leaning against an invisible wall
   and facing away from the corpse.

   That body is simply a writhing mass of vermin now - the odour has begun
   to draw some of the slimy akmans from the far-off jungle. I notice that
   many of the efjeh-weeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous
   feelers toward the thing; but I doubt if any are long enough to reach
   it. I wish some really carnivorous organisms like the skorahs would
   appear, for then they might scent me and wriggle a course through the
   building toward me. Things like that have an odd sense of direction. I
   could watch them as they came, and jot down their approximate route if
   they failed to form a continuous line. Even that would be a great help.
   When I met any the pistol would make short work of them.

   But I can hardly hope for as much as that. Now that these notes are
   made I shall rest a while longer, and later will do some more groping.
   As soon as I get back to the central chamber - which ought to be fairly
   easy - I shall try the extreme left-hand opening. Perhaps I can get
   outside by dusk after all.

   NIGHT - VI, 13

   New trouble. My escape will be tremendously difficult, for there are
   elements I had not suspected. Another night here in the mud, and a
   fight on my hands tomorrow. I cut my rest short and was up and groping
   again by four o'clock. After about fifteen minutes I reached the
   central chamber and moved my helmet to mark the last of the three
   possible doorways. Starting through this opening, I seemed to find the
   going more familiar, but was brought up short less than five minutes by
   a sight that jolted me more than I can describe.

   It was a group of four or five of those detestable man-lizards emerging
   from the forest far off across the plain. I could not see them
   distinctly at that distance, but thought they paused and turned toward
   the trees to gesticulate, after which they were joined by fully a dozen
   more. The augmented party now began to advance directly toward the
   invisible building, and as they approached I studied them carefully. I
   had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy
   shadows of the jungle.

   The resemblance to reptiles was perceptible, though I knew it was only
   an apparent one, since these beings have no point of contact with
   terrestrial life. When they drew nearer they seemed less truly
   reptilian - only the flat head and the green, slimy, frog-like skin
   carrying out the idea. They walked erect on their odd, thick stumps,
   and their suction-discs made curious noises in the mud. These were
   average specimens, about seven feet in height, and with four long, ropy
   pectoral tentacles. The motions of those tentacles - if the theories of
   Fogg, Ekberg, and Janat are right, which I formerly doubted but am now
   more ready to believe - indicate that the things were in animated
   conversation.

   I drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight. The odds were
   bad, but the weapon gave me a certain advantage. If the things knew
   this building they would come through it after me, and in this way
   would form a key to getting out; just as carnivorous skorahs might have
   done. That they would attack me seemed certain; for even though they
   could not see the crystal in my pouch, they could divine its presence
   through that special sense of theirs.

   Yet, surprisingly enough, they did not attack me. Instead they
   scattered and formed a vast circle around me - at a distance which
   indicated that they were pressing close to the unseen wall. Standing
   there in a ring, the beings stared silently and inquisitively at me,
   waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding their heads and gesturing
   with their upper limbs. After a while I saw others issue from the
   forest, and these advanced and joined the curious crowd. Those near the
   corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it. It was a
   horrible sight, yet the man-lizards seemed quite unconcerned. Now and
   then one of them would brush away the farnoth-flies with its limbs or
   tentacles, or crush a wriggling sificligh or akman, or an out-reaching
   efjeh-weed, with the suction discs on its stumps.

   Staring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders, and wondering
   uneasily why they did not attack me at once, I lost for the time being
   the will-power and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out.
   Instead I leaned limply against the invisible wall of the passage where
   I stood, letting my wonder merge gradually into a chain of the wildest
   speculations. A hundred mysteries which had previously baffled me
   seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister significance, and I
   trembled with an acute fear unlike anything I had experienced before.

   I believed I knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly
   around me. I believed, too, that I had the secret of the transparent
   structure at last. The alluring crystal which I had seized, the body of
   the man who had seized it before me - all these things began to acquire
   a dark and threatening meaning.

   It was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in
   this roofless, unseen tangle of corridors. Far from it. Beyond doubt,
   the place was a genuine maze - a labyrinth deliberately built by these
   hellish things whose craft and mentality I had so badly underestimated.
   Might I not have suspected this before, knowing of their uncanny
   architectural skill? The purpose was all too plain. It was a trap - a
   trap set to catch human beings, and with the crystal spheroid as bait.
   These reptilian things, in their war on the takers of crystals, had
   turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against us.

   Dwight - if this rotting corpse were indeed he - was a victim. He must
   have been trapped some time ago, and had failed to find his way out.
   Lack of water had doubtless maddened him, and perhaps he had run out of
   chlorate cubes as well. Probably his mask had not slipped accidentally
   after all. Suicide was a likelier thing. Rather than face a lingering
   death he had solved the issue by removing the mask deliberately and
   letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once. The horrible irony
   of his fate lay in his position - only a few feet from the saving exit
   he had failed to find. One minute more of searching and he would have
   been safe.

   And now I was trapped as he had been. Trapped, and with this circling
   herd of curious starers to mock at my predicament. The thought was
   maddening, and as it sank in I was seized with a sudden flash of panic
   which set me running aimlessly through the unseen hallways. For several
   moments I was essentially a maniac - stumbling, tripping, bruising
   myself on the invisible walls, and finally collapsing in the mud as a
   panting, lacerated heap of mindless, bleeding flesh.

   The fall sobered me a bit, so that when I slowly struggled to my feet I
   could notice things and exercise my reason. The circling watchers were
   swaying their tentacles in an odd, irregular way suggestive of sly,
   alien laughter, and I shook my fist savagely at them as I rose. My
   gesture seemed to increase their hideous mirth - a few of them clumsily
   imitating it with their greenish upper limbs. Shamed into sense, I
   tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situation.

   After all, I was not as badly off as Dwight has been. Unlike him, I
   knew what the situation was - and forewarned is forearmed. I had proof
   that the exit was attainable in the end, and would not repeat his
   tragic act of impatient despair. The body - or skeleton, as it would
   soon be - was constantly before me as a guide to the sought - for
   aperture, and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if I worked
   long and intelligently enough.

   I had, however, the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian
   devils. Now that I realized the nature of the trap - whose invisible
   material argued a science and technology beyond anything on earth - I
   could no longer discount the mentality and resources of my enemies.
   Even with my flame-pistol I would have a bad time getting away - though
   boldness and quickness would doubtless see me through in the long run.

   But first I must reach the exterior - unless I could lure or provoke
   some of the creatures to advance toward me. As I prepared my pistol for
   action and counted over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to
   me to try the effect of its blasts on the invisible walls. Had I
   overlooked a feasible means of escape? There was no clue to the
   chemical composition of the transparent barrier, and conceivably it
   might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese.
   Choosing a section facing the corpse, I carefully discharged the pistol
   at close range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed.
   Nothing was changed. I had seen the flame spread when it struck the
   surface, and now I realized that my hope had been vain. Only a long,
   tedious search for the exit would ever bring me to the outside.

   So, swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the
   elecrolyser of my mask, I recommenced the long quest; retracing my
   steps to the central chamber and starting out anew. I constantly
   consulted my notes and sketches, and made fresh ones - taking one false
   turn after another, but staggering on in desperation till the afternoon
   light grew very dim. As I persisted in my quest I looked from time to
   time at the silent circle of mocking stares, and noticed a gradual
   replacement in their ranks. Every now and then a few would return to
   the forest, while others would arrive to take their places. The more I
   thought of their tactics the less I liked them, for they gave me a hint
   of the creatures' possible motives. At any time these devils could have
   advanced and fought me, but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles
   to escape. I could not but infer that they enjoyed the spectacle - and
   this made me shrink with double force from the prospect of falling into
   their hands.

   With the dark I ceased my searching, and sat down in the mud to rest.
   Now I am writing in the light of my lamp, and will soon try to get some
   sleep. I hope tomorrow will see me out; for my canteen is low, and
   lacol tablets are a poor substitute for water. I would hardly dare to
   try the moisture in this slime, for none of the water in the
   mud-regions is potable except when distilled. That is why we run such
   long pipe lines to the yellow clay regions - or depend on rain-water
   when those devils find and cut our pipes. I have none too many chlorate
   cubes either, and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as
   I can. My tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon, and my later panic
   flight, burned up a perilous amount of air. Tomorrow I will reduce
   physical exertion to the barest minimum until I meet the reptiles and
   have to deal with them. I must have a good cube supply for the journey
   back to Terra Nova. My enemies are still on hand; I can see a circle of
   their feeble glow-torches around me. There is a horror about those
   lights which will keep me awake.

   NIGHT - VI, 14

   Another full day of searching and still no way out! I am beginning to
   be worried about the water problem, for my canteen went dry at noon. In
   the afternoon there was a burst of rain, and I went back to the central
   chamber for the helmet which I had left as a marker - using this as a
   bowl and getting about two cupfuls of water. I drank most of it, but
   have put the slight remainder in my canteen. Lacol tablets make little
   headway against real thirst, and I hope there will be more rain in the
   night. I am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls. Food
   tablets are none too plentiful, but not dangerously low. I shall halve
   my rations from now on. The chlorate cubes are my real worry, for even
   without violent exercise the day's endless tramping burned a dangerous
   number. I feel weak from my forced economies in oxygen, and from my
   constantly mounting thirst. When I reduce my food I suppose I shall
   feel still weaker.

   There is something damnable - something uncanny - about this labyrinth.
   I could swear that I had eliminated certain turns through charting, and
   yet each new trial belies some assumption I had thought established.
   Never before did I realize how lost we are without visual landmarks. A
   blind man might do better - but for most of us sight is the king of the
   senses. The effect of all these fruitless wanderings is one of profound
   discouragement. I can understand how poor Dwight must have felt. His
   corpse is now just a skeleton, and the sificlighs and akmans and
   farnoth-flies are gone. The efjen-weeds are nipping the leather
   clothing to pieces, for they were longer and faster-growing than I had
   expected. And all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand
   gloatingly around the barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery.
   Another day and I shall go mad if I do not drop dead from exhaustion.

   However, there is nothing to do but persevere. Dwight would have got
   out if he had kept on a minute longer. It is just possible that
   somebody from Terra Nova will come looking for me before long, although
   this is only my third day out. My muscles ache horribly, and I can't
   seem to rest at all lying down in this loathesome mud. Last night,
   despite my terrific fatigue, I slept only fitfully, and tonight I fear
   will be no better. I live in an endless nightmare - poised between
   waking and sleeping, yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep. My hand
   shakes, I can write no more for the time being. That circle of feeble
   glow-torches is hideous.

   LATE AFTERNOON - VI, 15

   Substantial progress! Looks good. Very weak, and did not sleep much
   till daylight. Then I dozed till noon, though without being at all
   rested. No rain, and thirst leaves me very weak. Ate an extra food
   tablet to keep me going, but without water it didn't help much. I dared
   to try a little of the slime water just once, but it made me violently
   sick and left me even thirstier than before. Must save chlorate cubes,
   so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen. Can't walk much of the
   time, but manage to crawl in the mud. About 2 P.M. I thought I
   recognized some passages, and got substantially nearer to the corpse -
   or skeleton - than I had been since the first day's trials. I was
   sidetracked once in a blind alley, but recovered the main trail with
   the aid of my chart and notes. The trouble with these jottings is that
   there are so many of them. They must cover three feet of the record
   scroll, and I have to stop for long periods to untangle them.

   My head is weak from thirst, suffocation, and exhaustion, and I cannot
   understand all I have set down. Those damnable green things keep
   staring and laughing with their tentacles, and sometimes they
   gesticulate in a way that makes me think they share some terrible joke
   just beyond my perception.

   It was three o'clock when I really struck my stride. There was a
   doorway which, according to my notes, I had not traversed before; and
   when I tried it I found I could crawl circuitously toward the
   weed-twined skeleton. The route was a sort of spiral, much like that by
   which I had first reached the central chamber. Whenever I came to a
   lateral doorway or junction I would keep to the course which seemed
   best to repeat that original journey. As I circled nearer and nearer to
   my gruesome landmark, the watchers outside intensified their cryptic
   gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter. Evidently they saw
   something grimly amusing in my progress - perceiving no doubt how
   helpless I would be in any encounter with them. I was content to leave
   them to their mirth; for although I realized my extreme weakness, I
   counted on the flame pistol and its numerous extra magazines to get me
   through the vile reptilian phalanx.

   Hope now soared high, but I did not attempt to rise to my feet. Better
   crawl now, and save my strength for the coming encounter with the
   man-lizards. My advance was very slow, and the danger of straying into
   some blind alley very great, but nonetheless I seemed to curve steadily
   toward my osseous goal. The prospect gave me new strength, and for the
   nonce I ceased to worry about my pain, my thirst, and my scant supply
   of cubes. The creatures were now all massing around the entrance -
   gesturing, leaping, and laughing with their tentacles. Soon, I
   reflected, I would have to face the entire horde - and perhaps such
   reinforcements as they would receive from the forest.

   I am now only a few yards from the skeleton, and am pausing to make
   this entry before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of
   entities. I feel confident that with my last ounce of strength I can
   put them to flight despite their numbers, for the range of this pistol
   is tremendous. Then a camp on the dry moss at the plateau's edge, and
   in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to Terra Nova. I shall
   be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings again. The
   teeth of that skull gleam and grin horribly.

   TOWARD NIGHT - VI, I 5

   Horror and despair. Baffled again! After making the previous entry I
   approached still closer to the skeleton, but suddenly encountered an
   intervening wall. I had been deceived once more, and was apparently
   back where I had been three days before, on my first futile attempt to
   leave the labyrinth. Whether I screamed aloud I do not know - perhaps I
   was too weak to utter a sound. I merely lay dazed in the mud for a long
   period, while the greenish things outside leaped and laughed and
   gestured.

   After a time I became more fully conscious. My thirst and weakness and
   suffocation were fast gaining on me, and with my last bit of strength I
   put a new cube in the electrolyser - recklessly, and without regard for
   the needs of my journey to Terra Nova. The fresh oxygen revived me
   slightly, and enabled me to look about more alertly.

   It seemed as if I were slightly more distant from poor Dwight than I
   had been at that first disappointment, and I dully wondered if I could
   be in some other corridor a trifle more remote. With this faint shadow
   of hope I laboriously dragged myself forward - but after a few feet
   encountered a dead end as I had on the former occasion.

   This, then, was the end. Three days had taken me nowhere, and my
   strength was gone. I would soon go mad from thirst, and I could no
   longer count on cubes enough to get me back. I feebly wondered why the
   nightmare things had gathered so thickly around the entrance as they
   mocked me. Probably this was part of the mockery - to make me think I
   was approaching an egress which they knew did not exist.

   I shall not last long, though I am resolved not to hasten matters as
   Dwight did. His grinning skull has just turned toward me, shifted by
   the groping of one of the efjeh-weeds that are devouring his leather
   suit. The ghoulish stare of those empty eye-sockets is worse than the
   staring of those lizard horrors. It lends a hideous meaning to that
   dead, white-toothed grin.

   I shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength I can. This
   record - which I hope may reach and warn those who come after me - will
   soon be done. After I stop writing I shall rest a long while. Then,
   when it is too dark for those frightful creatures to see, I shall
   muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the record
   scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside.
   I shall take care to send it toward the left, where it will not hit the
   leaping band of mocking beleaguers. Perhaps it will be lost forever in
   the thin mud - but perhaps it will land in some widespread clump of
   weeds and ultimately reach the hands of men.

   If it does survive to be read, I hope it may do more than merely warn
   men of this trap. I hope it may teach our race to let those shining
   crystals stay where they are. They belong to Venus alone. Our planet
   does not truly need them, and I believe we have violated some obscure
   and mysterious law - some law buried deep in the arcane of the cosmos -
   in our attempts to take them. Who can tell what dark, potent, and
   widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who guard their
   treasure so strangely? Dwight and I have paid, as others have paid and
   will pay. But it may be that these scattered deaths are only the
   prelude of greater horrors to come. Let us leave to Venus that which
   belongs only to Venus.

   I am very near death now, and fear I may not be able to throw the
   scroll when dusk comes. If I cannot, I suppose the man-lizards will
   seize it, for they will probably realize what it is. They will not wish
   anyone to be warned of the labyrinth - and they will not know that my
   message holds a plea in their own behalf. As the end approaches I feel
   more kindly towards the things. In the scale of cosmic entity who can
   say which species stands higher, or more nearly ap-proaches a
   space-wide organic norm - theirs or mine?

   I have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my
   last moments. It shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the
   dying day. The leaping horde have noticed it, and their gestures have
   changed in a way I cannot understand. I wonder why they keep clustered
   around the entrance instead of concentrating at a still closer point in
   the transparent wall.

   I am growing numb and cannot write much more. Things whirl around me,
   yet I do not lose consciousness. Can I throw this over the wall? That
   crystal glows so, yet the twilight is deepening.

   Dark. Very weak. They are still laughing and leaping around the
   doorway, and have started those hellish glow-torches.

   Are they going away? I dreamed I heard a sound... light in the sky.

   REPORT OF WESLEY P. MILLER, SUPT. GROUP A, VENUS CRYSTAL CO.

   (TERRA NOVA ON VENUS - Vl, 16)

   Our Operative A-49, Kenton J. Stanfield of 5317 Marshall Street,
   Richmond, Va., left Terra Nova early on VI, 12, for a short-term trip
   indicated by detector. Due back 13th or 14th. Did not appear by evening
   of 15th, so Scouting Plane FR-58 with five men under my command set out
   at 8 P.M. to follow route with detector. Needle showed no change from
   earlier readings.

   Followed needle to Erycinian Highland, played strong searchlights all
   the way. Triple-range flame-guns and D-radiation cylinders could have
   dispersed any ordinary hostile force of natives, or any dangerous
   aggregation of carnivorous skorahs.

   When over the open plain on Eryx we saw a group of moving lights which
   we knew were native glow-torches. As we approached, they scattered into
   the forest. Probably seventy-five to a hundred in all. Detector
   indicated crystal on spot where they had been. Sailing low over this
   spot, our lights picked out objects on the ground. Skeleton tangled in
   efjeh-weeds, and complete body ten feet from it. Brought plane down
   near bodies, and corner of wing crashed on unseen obstruction.

   Approaching bodies on foot, we came up short against a smooth,
   invisible barrier which puzzled us enormously. Feeling along it near
   the skeleton, we struck an opening, beyond which was a space with
   another opening leading to the skeleton. The latter, though robbed of
   clothing by weeds, had one of the company's numbered metal helmets
   beside it. It was Operative B-9, Frederick N. Dwight of Koenig's
   division, who had been out of Terra Nova for two months on a long
   commission.

   Between this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another
   wall, but we could easily identify the second man as Stanfield. He had
   a record scroll in his left hand and a pen in his right, and seemed to
   have been writing when he died. No crystal was visible, but the
   detector indicated a huge specimen near Stanfield's body.

   We had great difficulty in getting at Stanfield, but finally succeeded.
   The body was still warm, and a great crystal lay beside it, covered by
   the shallow mud. We at once studied the record scroll in the left hand,
   and prepared to take certain steps based on its data. The contents of
   the scroll forms the long narrative prefixed to this report; a
   narrative whose main descriptions we have verified, and which we append
   as an explanation of what was found. The later parts of this account
   show mental decay, but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it.
   Stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst, suffocation,
   cardiac strain, and psychological depression. His mask was in place,
   and freely generating oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supply.

   Our plane being damaged, we sent a wireless and called out Anderson
   with Repair Plane PG-7, a crew of wreckers, and a set of blasting
   materials. By morning FH-58 was fixed, and went back under Anderson
   carrying the two bodies and the crystal. We shall bury Dwight and
   Stanfield in the company graveyard, and ship the crystal to Chicago on
   the next earth-bound liner. Later, we shall adopt Stanfield's
   suggestion - the sound one in the saner, earlier part of his report -
   and bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether. With
   a clear field, there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal
   we can secure.

   In the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great
   care, exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords, and preparing a
   complete chart for our archives. We were much impressed by the design,
   and shall keep specimens of the substance for chemical analysis. All
   such knowledge will be useful when we take over the various cities of
   the natives. Our type C diamond drills were able to bite into the
   unseen material, and wreckers are now planting dynamite preparatory to
   a thorough blasting. Nothing will be left when we are done. The edifice
   forms a distinct menace to aerial and other possible traffic.

   In considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with
   the irony of Dwight's fate, but with that of Stanfield as well. When
   trying to reach the second body from the skeleton, we could find no
   access on the right, but Markheim found a doorway from the first inner
   space some fifteen feet past Dwight and four or five past Stanfield.
   Beyond this was a long hall which we did not explore till later, but on
   the right-hand side of that hall was another doorway leading directly
   to the body. Stanfield could have reached the outside entrance by
   walking twenty-two or twenty-three feet if he had found the opening
   which lay directly behind him - an opening which he overlooked in his
   exhaustion and despair.

   Laeta; a Lament

   Published February 1918.
   9470Laeta; a LamentH. P. Lovecraft

             Respectfully dedicated to Rheinhart Kiciner, Esq.,
                       With compliments of the author

   How sad droop the willows by Zalal's fair side,
   Where so lately I stray'd with my raven-hair'd bride;
   Ev'ry light-floating lily, each flow'r on the shore,
   Folds in sorrow since Laeta can see them no more!
   Oh blest were the days when in childhood and hope
   With my Laeta I rov'd o'er the blossom-clad slope,
   Plucking white meadow-daisies and ferns by the stream,
   As we laugh'd at the ripples that twinkle and gleam.
   Not a bloom deck'd the mead that could rival in grace
   The dear innocent charms of my Laeta's fair face;
   Not a thrush thrill'd the grove with a carol so choice
   As the silvery strains of my Laeta's sweet voice.
   The shy nymphs of the woodlands, the fount, and the plain,
   Strove to equal her beauty, but strove all in vain;
   Yet no envy they bore her, while fruitless they strove,
   For so pure was my Laeta, they could only love!
   When the warm breath of Auster play'd soft o'er the flow'rs,
   And young Zephyrus rustled the gay scented bow'rs,
   Ev'ry breeze seem'd to pause as it drew near the fair,
   Too much aw'd at her sweetness to tumble her hair.
   How fond were our dreams on the day when we stood
   In the ivy-grown temple beside the dark wood;
   When our pledges we seal'd at the sanctify'd shrine,
   And I knew that my Laeta forever was mine!
   How blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came,
   And the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame;
   Yet how heavy my heart when I first felt the fear
   That my starry-eyed Laeta would fade with the year!
   The pastures were sere and the heavens were grey
   When I laid my lov'd Laeta forever away,
   And the river god pity'd, as weeping I pac'd
   Mingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste.
   Now the flow'rs have return'd, but they bloom not so sweet
   As in days when they blossom'd round Laeta's dear feet;
   And the willows complain to the answering hill,
   And the thrushes that once were so happy are still.
   The green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine,
   Whilst the dryads no more in their madrigals join,
   The breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs,
   And blows soft o'er the spot where my lov'd Laeta lies.
   So pensive I roam o'er the desolate lawn
   Where we wander'd and lov'd in the days that are gone,
   And I yearn for the autumn, when Zalal's blue tide
   Shall sing low by my grave and the lov'd Laeta's side.

   P.S. A new pictorial artist will work wonders for W.T. There is a
   special technique to weird drawing -- a sort of sinister, mocking
   approach to conventional design + a subtle grotesquerie + distortion.
   The best example I know of is S.H.Sime, who illustrates The standard
   editions of Dunsany's books:
   598 Angell St., Providence, R.I.,

   February 2, 1924

   My dear Mr. Henneberger:

   I was very glad to hear from you, and to receive so many sidelights on
   WEIRD TALES, whose chosen field makes me very eager for its success. I
   know the financial end of magazine publishing must be a tremendous and
   often discouraging responsibility, and I have a sincere respect for the
   pluck and determination of anybody who undertakes such a venture. Most
   certainly do I hope that some favourable turn will gradually transform
   your burdensome debt on the two magazines into an increasingly
   gratifying profit--and it seems to me that many facts warrant such
   optimism, for in the weird field you are practically alone and with a
   good start, whilst in the detective field there sees to be an
   insatiable demand for new material. Still, I know that marketing is a
   venturesome and uncertain process--especially with dealers in the
   unscrupulous state of mind you describe!

   I assure you that I was not at all disconcerted by the presence of "The
   Transparent Ghost" beside my "Hound". In the first place, I don't take
   myself too seriously; and in the second place, I can appreciate the
   sort of humour involved in such touches of "comic relief"--like the
   gravedigger in "Hamlet" or the porter in "Macbeth". When a magazine
   covers a popular clientele and appeals to one particular interest, it
   is peculiarly apt to elicit literary--or more or
   less-literary--contributions from its readers; so that I suppose a very
   large proportion of those who have seen WEIRD TALES have flooded the
   office with unacceptable manuscripts. To them the whole subject of
   impossible contributions has become a live issue, so that the
   exploitation of some comically illiterate attempt carries a piquancy
   which they can feel and smile at even though others may find it
   somewhat tedious and inapropos. "The Transparent Ghost" may not be an
   austerely literary asset, yet I cannot doubt but that it will make many
   friends for the magazine, and perhaps assuage more than one subtle
   sting left behind by rejected MSS.

   I hope, anyway, that this matter won't be instrumental in deposing Mr.
   Baird from the editorship until he is himself ready to relinquish it;
   for I feel that he must have done very well on the whole, considering
   the adverse conditions encountered in the quest for really weird
   stories. That he could get hold of as many as five perfectly
   satisfactory yarns is an almost remarkable phenomenon in view of the
   lack of truly artistic and individual expression among professional
   fiction-writers. When I see a magazine tending toward the commonplace,
   the last people I blame are the editors and publishers; for even a
   cursory survey of the professional writing field shows that the trouble
   is something infinitely deeper and wider--something concerning no one
   publication, but the whole atmosphere and temperament of the American
   fiction business. And even when I get to such large units as this, I
   can't be any too savage about the blaming--because I realise that much
   of the trouble is absolutely inevitable--as incapable of human remedy
   as the fate of any protagonist in the Greek drama. Here in America we
   have a very conventional and half-educated public--a public trained
   under one phase or another of the Puritan tradition, and almost dulled
   to aesthetic sensitiveness because of the monotonous and omnipresent
   overstressing of the ethical element. We have millions who lack the
   intellectual independence, courage, and flexibility to get an artistic
   thrill out of a bizarre situation, and who enter sympathetically into a
   story only when it ignores the colour and vividness of actual human
   emotions and conventionally presents a simple plot based on artificial,
   ethically sugar-coated values and leading to a flat denouement which
   shall vindicate every current platitude and leave no mystery
   unexplained by the shallow comprehension of the most mediocre reader.
   That is the kind of a public publishers confront, and only a fool or a
   rejection-venomed author could blame the publishers for a condition
   caused not by them but by the whole essence and historic tradition of
   our civilisation If publishers of general magazines sought and used
   artistically original types of fiction, they would lose their readers
   almost to a man. Half of the people wouldn't understand what the tales
   were about, and the other half would find the characters
   unsympathetic--because they would think and act like real people
   instead of like the dummies which the American middle classes have been
   taught and persuaded to consider and accept as people. Such, I repeat,
   is the inevitable condition regarding general fiction; the enormous
   bulk of fiction which sets the national standard and determines the
   type of technical training given all fictional students. But even this
   is not all! Added to this, as if by the perversity of a malign fate, is
   the demand of an overspeeding public for excessive quantity production.
   Baldly put, the American people demand more stories per year than the
   really artistic authors of America could possibly write. A real artist
   never works fast, and never turns out large quantities. He can't
   contract to deliver so many words in such and such a time, but must
   work slowly, gradually, and by mood; utilising favourable states of
   mind and refraining from putting down the stuff his brain turns out
   when it is tired of disinclined to such work. How this, of course,
   won't do when there are hundreds of magazines to fill at regular
   intervals. So many pages per month or week have got to be filled, and
   if the artistic writers can't do it, the publishers must find the
   next-best thing--persons of mere talent, who can learn certain
   mechanical rules and technical twists, and put forth stuff of external
   smoothness, whose sole merit is conforming to patterns and rehashing
   the situations and reactions which have been found interesting to the
   people by previous experience. In many cases these writers achieve
   popularity--because the public recognise the elements that pleased them
   before, and are satisfied to receive them again in transposed fora.
   Actually, the typical reader has very little true taste; and judges by
   absurd freaks, sentimentalities, and analogies. So it has come to be an
   accepted tradition that American fiction is not an art but a trade--a
   thing to be learnt by rule by almost anybody, and demanding above all
   else a complete submergence of one's own personality and thought in the
   general stream of conventional patterns which correspond to the bleakly
   uniform view of life forced on us by mediocre leadership. Success
   therefore comes not to the man of genius, but to the clever fellow who
   knows.how to catch the public point of view and play up to it.
   Glittering tinsel reputations are built up, and dumb driven hundreds of
   otherwise honest plumbers take correspondence courses and try to be
   like these scintillant "great ones" whose achievements are really no
   more than mere charlatanry. Such is our fictional
   situation--indiscriminate hordes of writers, mostly without genius,
   striving by erroneous methods toward a goal which is erroneous to start
   with! You see the thing at its zenith in papers like THE SATURDAY
   EVENING POST--where men of more or less real talent are weighted down
   with the freely-flung gold which forms the price of their originality
   and artistic conscience. A fearful incubus--which only a few adroit or
   daring souls ever shake off.

   Now weird fiction, even in America, is not subject to the limitations
   of general fiction. When a person the sort of person forming the
   readers of macabre fiction--wants an outre narrative at all, he is
   willing and anxious to take something removed from the beaten track of
   the national tradition; the tradition of conventional insipidity. Here
   is our real exception--the man who wants something original--but in the
   face of a general tradition which usurps all the education of our
   story-tellers, we can only ask in tragic accents, who is going to give
   it to him? Popular custom dins it into every young author that he must
   conform to patterns and reflect a smug artificial world and psychology.
   How can he beat this game of loaded dice in the one matter of the
   weird, which as a minority branch can hardly be expected to develop a
   school all its own in defiance of general fictional custom? I've yet to
   see the person who can answer that question. I've tried to take in hand
   a bright young chap in this town--a fellow with a conventional start,
   but who is now anxious to succeed with the weird. Time and again I
   alter his work, deleting commonplace situations, images, and reactions,
   and introducing touches which he never thought of, but which I consider
   dramatically effective in that kind of work. Time and again I do this,
   yet with the most discouraging results. I succeed for a time--then in
   some knotty tangle his old training asserts itself and he surmounts a
   situation in the stereotyped, unimaginative popular way. And all the
   time I am trying to help him I have a curiously contrary sensation of
   guilt, in that I may be spoiling him for salable work in the non-weird
   field by shaking his faith in flashy conventions!

   So when I read WEIRD TALES, and note here and there a story full of
   hackneyed stuff--the laboratory, the club-room with well-groomed men
   around the fire, the beautiful queen of remote planets, the ghost that
   is a human villain trying to scare somebody out of a house ... etc.
   etc. ... I never think of blaming Mr. Baird; for out of a somewhat wide
   knowledge of non-eminent writers, gained through various club
   affiliations, I am perfectly well aware that he had to take the stuff
   because no man living could' get enough of anything else to fill the
   required number of pages at the required intervals. I don' t believe
   there is enough first-rate weird fiction written in America to fill a
   monthly magazine the size of WEIRD TALES--and it could be developed
   only by catching the author young and making it possible for him to
   abstain from doing conventional fiction. The best you'll ever get is
   from men of liberal culture who do that sort of thing as an
   avocation--for the sheer thrill of it, and not with a professional
   frame of mind. I should say Paul Suter is like-that--or Burton Peter
   Thom, or Seabury Quinn, or M. Humphreys, or Anthony M. Rud (though he's
   had a book published), or sevaral others I don't recall plainly by
   name. These people have all been represented by excellent work, and I
   believe it would almost be better to have more than one take by each in
   a single issue than to use less vivid material merely for the sake of
   non-repeating on the same table of contents. "Beyond the Door" was a
   finely effective piece--as were "The Floor Above", "Ooze", and "The
   Phantom Farmhouse". Another thing I noted some of the best ideas--the
   ideas which showed the most original power and understanding of the
   essence of the terrible and grotesque--were handled by obvious novices
   or at least writers with no command of technique or sense of literary
   balance. I'm quite enthusiastic about "The leaving Shadows", by.Holmes
   in your very first issue. That thing is bungling and halting so far as
   form goes--but I'll be hanged if it hasn't got a thrill which no
   commonplace person, however highly trained, could ever duplicate. "The
   Open Window" by Frank Owen (January) is not dissimilar as a case of
   first-rate idea and third-rate development; though here the poignancy
   of the idea and the crudeness of the narration are both less marked. I
   honestly believe that one way to get good weird material is to tell the
   editor to sharpen his scent for the genuinely bizarre irrespective of
   technique, accept any powerful plot or atmospheric triumph irrespective
   of technique or even literacy--paying half the usual market price and
   telling the author why--and the have the raw material completely
   re-written "by some staff writer of competent training, who could add
   his name as collaborator or not. according to the amount of work he
   puts into it. In this way, I am confident, you could get many better
   things than you could by excluding all MSS. below a certain technical
   standard. It isn't always the college man, or even the reasonably
   proficient writer, who has the mental slant that makes vivid ideas. Of
   course, there would hardly be an abundance of these notable but
   inadequate MSS., yet I think there would be enough to warrant their
   acceptance and re-writing. I know I've many a time doctored up
   something for another fellow which seemed very crude at first, but
   whenhafter completion made me wish I were its full author. But at best
   it's hard work getting convincing horror material. Among even the most
   eminent the true touch of sublime and delirious fear is deucedly hard
   to find. Arthur Machen is the only living master--in the full sense of
   the word I could possibly name in this field ... a point which I think
   anyone can appreciate by comparing his episode of "The White powder" in
   "The Three Impostors" with every other tale of terror known to this
   generation. I think, though, that with the requisite capital, a
   magazine could train tip a group of effective weird writers by offering
   them a free and lucrative field, and letting some expert give them
   recommendations as to reading--what authors to avoid, and what ones to
   emulate. I know a kid--a junior at Columbia named Prank B. long,
   Jr.,--who could give you some creepy stuff if he could be persuaded to
   write out half the ideas he has. I'm inducing him to send in a
   poem--"An Old Wife Speaketh It"--to WEIRD TALES, and if he receives
   encouragement he may furnish more. There must be more like him--if one
   has the time to look them up. A youth in your own city--Alfred Galpin
   Jr., now holding a post-graduate fellowship at the university of
   Chicago--wrote something at sixteen which would chill any average
   blood; but circumstance--and the general scholastic genius which is
   going to make an eminent professor of him some day--sidetracked this
   phase of his genius.

   What you say about writing up and amplifying real horrors and ghastly
   tragedies is interesting and probably sensible from the standpoint of
   popular interest. It ought to attract readers because of its appeal to
   the strings of memory--nearly everyone will have heard each theme
   mentioned in Associated press items, hence will feel an added sense of
   shuddering reality. Yet from the art standpoint--from the standpoint of
   effective evocation of nameless ecstacies of keen-edged and titillating
   rear--I don't think anything can equal good weird fiction. There is
   only a passing horror in sordid, sanguinary gruesomeness--in bloody axe
   murders and sadistic morbidities. What really moves the profoundest
   springs of human fear and unholy fascination is something which
   suggests black infinite vistas of cryptic, brooding, half-inscrutable
   monstrosities for ever lurking behind nature and as capable of being
   manifested again as in the case treated. The supreme principle of this
   sort of horror is any suggestion of the major violation of some, basic
   law of nature--the breaking down of the line betwixt life and death,
   man and the other animals, etc.--or the annihilation of the principle
   of time and space, bringing vastly remote age or localities into
   juxtaposition. A true artist in the terrible can always invent ideas
   and plots a thousandfold more effective than any real tragedy or fright
   which ever darkened the earth, gilding then--or ebonising them--with a
   subtlety of atmosphere which is after all the most potent single factor
   in any imaginative tale. Come to think of it, I guess atmosphere and
   colour mean more any day than idea or plot--this being the reason we
   have so few effective phantasies in these days when plot and action are
   played up at the expense of the more leisurely attributes of writing.
   Of course, atmosphere is the one thing which a skilful developer can
   give a real-life tragedy. He can colour it to his heart's content, and
   inject suspicions of more than mortal motives and agencies which bring
   it close to the effective fictional state. I certainly think your idea
   is worth trying, though as a lover of fictional art for its own sake I
   should hate to see the monthly quota of stories descend to the minimum
   record of two or three, exclusive of the novel. I don't think I really
   enjoy anything so much as a really good weird story. I would give a
   thousand dollars not to have read Poe's "House of Usher" or "Ligeia",
   just for the thrill of following them breathlessly with pristine
   suspense over what was coming'. I have never seen a copy of "The
   Terrific Register", and must confess to a perfect ignorance of what it
   is. If you can connect me with a copy, at my expense, I shall consider
   myself ever afterward your debtor'. By the way, thtough--just before I
   forget it--let me say that I think the weakest thing about the present
   WEIRD TALES is the prevalence of news "fillers", some of which have a
   very remote connection with actual weirdness. Bald news certainly needs
   a skilful retouching before it assorts well with the fictional
   atmosphere. I'd suggest that the new policy of using poetry is very
   good ... and don't think I say this because Ur. Baird has just accepted
   some verse from me'. I wish you could use more verse by my California
   friend Clark Ashton Smith, who has perpetrated some terrific flights
   such as "The Hashish-Eater; or, The Apocalypse of Evil." Smith also
   draws splendidly, and with more encouragement than he received from
   Houtain, could turn out some sketches much better than his
   illustrations to my "Lurking Pear". But all this is mere random
   suggestion, made whilst i think of it.

   I am interested in the idea you originally formed from my stuff in HOME
   BREW--especially interested because I consider that stuff among my
   poorest. Ordinarily I refuse altogether to write to order, or to give
   my tales any mechanical limitations to suit other people. But Houtain
   is a personal friend of mine--he'd have to be, to get me to read his
   ribald rag--and when he started HOME BREW he was desperately anxious to
   get me to give him some of my stuff. I offered him his pick of all my
   MSS., but they didn't look quite flashy and lowbrow enough to suit him;
   so he began to entreat that I prepare him a series of six tales, each
   of 2000 words and complete in itself, which should go the limit for
   sensational morbidity. I might add that my taste does not run
   especially to the morbid as such, that I love is the unreal and the
   fantastic in every form; though of course only such of my work as is
   terrible could ever please a popular audience. Finally I agreed, for
   friendship's sake, to give Houtain what he wanted, running over a list
   pf possible plots until he took a fancy to the notion of a
   grave-robbing physician who restored life to bodies and was finally
   snatched himself by the bodies he had resuscitated, together with
   certain nameless companions of theirs. This I developed into the series
   "Herbert West-Reanimator", and I can assure you I was sick of the job
   before I was half done. The necessity for the completeness of each
   instalment spoiled the artistry of the whole thing--involving as it did
   the wearisome recapitulation of former matter in each instalment, and
   the eternal repetition of the description of Dr. Herbert West and his
   unamiable pursuits. When I had that out of the way, I vowed I would
   never again write a tale to order; and succumbed in the case of "The
   Lurking Pear" only because Houtain permitted me to forego the series
   form and make it a regular serial. The prospect of Smith's
   illustrations was another bait--though in the end they proved much
   below his usual pictorial halting average. But "The Lurking Pear" never
   satisfied me, "because I unwisely tried to follow Houtain's wish for
   perfectly equal instalments--irrespective of dramatic values--and for a
   smashing sub-climax at the end of each instalment. The result of all
   this was a certain artificiality and straining, and a redundancy of
   incident in many of the instalments. I still feel that I have
   half-wasted a good plot idea, and often believe I would like to rewrite
   the thing for my own artistic satisfaction and let some magazine
   publish the new version free after securing the necessary permission
   from Houtain! I don't think it ought to be a serial at all--it's short
   enough to be complete without a break or chapter-division, especially
   with the redundant matter cut out. But it taught me one thing--never to
   try to suit the other fellow or let my original instincts of form get
   overridden! Now I'm fully resolved to let all my work stay unpublished
   unless somebody will print it without a comma or semicolon changed! The
   old-fashioned touch in my work is the result of my natural temperament
   and reading. I grew up with a large family library in a big house, and
   browsed at random because I was too ill to attend school or even follow
   a tutor's course with any regularity. Somehow I acquired a fondness for
   the past as compared with the present--a fondness which had plenty of
   chance to reign because my semi-invalidism continued and kept me from
   college and business despite the most extravagant ambitions of boyhood.
   frothing modern had any permanent power to fascinate me--and until my
   WEIRD TALES venture my only acquaintance with modern magazines was a
   spell of ALL-STORY and ARGOSY reading ten or fifteen years ago,
   undertaken for the purpose of capturing the occasional weird yarns in
   these periodicals--especially the former. The classics were my diet,
   and I have never found anything else half so good! My style, of course,
   is fundamentally and immutably antique--complacently antique, I might
   add--and most of my tastes correspond. A new interest which has grown
   as my health has grown during the past three years, is that of Colonial
   architecture--the visual re-creation of the 18th century by study of
   its surviving landmarks--and most of my new-born strength has been
   utilised in the exploration of the antique towns which abound in my
   native New-England. So- really, I don't think you could have paid me a
   handsomer unconscious compliment than when you suspected my "Lurking
   Pear" of being a re-written antique. I hope you didn't think it was
   very extensively re-written! Only a charge of verbatim plagiarism from
   an 18th century master could have pleased me more!

   I shall watch the modified future of WEIRD TALES with keen interest,
   looking with especial avidity for your own work, since you so
   emphatically share my aversion for the insipid rubber-stamp popular
   magazine atmosphere. The acquisition of Houdini ought to be a great
   selling asset, for his fame and ability in his spectacular line are
   vast and indisputable. I am not much of a vaudeville follower, but it
   happens that I saw him at the old Keith's Theatre here nearly a quarter
   of a century ago it must have been at the very outset of his career,
   for he was not then especially well known. Since then it interested me
   to hear that he comes from Appleton, Wisconsin, the home town of my
   learned young friend Alfred Galpin, whom I mentioned earlier in this
   epistle. I did not know that he writes, or that he possessed such a
   notable library as you describe. Certainly, it will afford me
   unmeasured delight to meet this library and its versatile owner--a
   thing the more probable because, although not much given to long trips,
   it is very likely that I shall live in New York after the coming
   spring. I suppose his articles naturally would have the imperfect
   background you mention, because he has been mainly accustomed to
   expressing his personality in different ways. I can tell better after
   seeing the one in the March issue, perhaps Houdini furnishes an
   instance of the condition I mentioned before--the creator of genius who
   needs a re-writer to give his recorded work the form which may
   perfectly express its spirit.

   Your compliment anent "The Rats in the Walls" delights me mightily--the
   more so because Robert H. Davis of the Munsey firm rejected it after
   some deliberation as too horrible for his readers ... another
   illustration of the essential insipidity and conventionality inculcated
   into our writing public by some of its leaders. When the manuscript was
   read among the circle of my friends in Hew York, Arthur Leeds--the man
   who conducts the "Thinks and Things" department in THE WRITER'S
   MONTHLY--was gratifyingly enthusiastic about it, but declared pretty
   dogmatically, I am told, that no American magazine would ever accept
   it. Such are the tacitly acknowledged and submissively accepted
   conventions of the timid majority!

   I feel flattered that you should wish to see a long manuscript of
   mine--25,000 words or more--and will probably have something of the
   sort to show you in the near future. Formerly I wrote only short
   stories, believing that this was the ideal form for weird fiction; but
   perusal of certain weird novels gradually changed my point of view,
   until after my Houtain experiments in greater length I began to map out
   certain of my more involved ideas as possible novels. I keep plot ideas
   and skeletonic synopses recorded in a blank-book--the sort one would
   call a "commonplace-book" if the term did not carry a certain irony as
   applied to the contents of this particular one! Jfy main novel idea is
   that of a long phantasy to be called (subject to change) "Azathoth",
   dealing with bizarre scenes somewhat in the exotic spirit of the
   Arabian Fights. I don't know when I shall tackle the. actual writing of
   this, but I'm sure you wouldn't care for it for WEIRD TALES, since it
   will be horrible only in parts, and contain also much prose-poetic
   matter and descriptions of cities and landscapes which are marvellous
   and weird, but not gruesome or terrible. It will belong to the category
   of "Vathek", or some of Dunsany's longer, more ethereal, and less
   sophisticated things. In the horrible parts, though, I don't intend to
   be in the least insipid or commonplace! The scene will probably be in a
   distant planet, and there may be no human characters in the accepted
   sense of the word. Other things than humans, you know, may go through
   very vivid adventures and embark on very picturesque quests. But I
   think I shall send you, unless it pans out too long, a second tale
   which is about ready for the actual composition. This (also
   provisionally) will be known as "The House of the Worm", and deal with
   the frantic message sent by a dying and prematurely aged father to the
   boy who ran away twenty years before because of a nameless dread of his
   new stepmother ... the heiress who lived in the dark house in the
   swamp. The young man comes, and finds his father alone in the house (or
   castle--I'm not sure whether I'll put it in Hew England or Old England
   or the German Black Forest) ... alone, yet not alone ... for he looks
   furtively about him ... and other forms flit through remote corridors,
   strangely attracting swarms of flies after them ... and vultures hover
   over the whole swamp ... and the young man sees things when he goes out
   on one occasion ... but I needn't say more. You can see what sort of a
   yarn it is, and I shall certainly send it when it is done; unless, as I
   say, it comes to an odd and peculiarly unacceptable length, perhaps
   I'll send it anyway.

   But I see that I've rattled this letter out to unconscionable
   lengths--for which I trust you'll duly forgive me. I hope my various
   remarks may have buried in them some grains of sense which will answer
   for intelligent suggestions, though as a practical planner I never was
   very notable. I certainly wish you the very best of luck with WEIRD
   TALES, and hope every modification may develop in the right direction;
   though I realise very fully all the difficulties besetting any
   experiment of the sort. Is it ethical and possible to get in touch with
   writers in other magazines? In thinking over my old ALL-STORY reading,
   and newer specimens brought to my attention, I recall several people
   who did very fair work--and one case of actual excellence. This last is
   a writer signing himself A. Merritt, who some five years ago had a
   novelette in the ALL-STORY called "The Moon Pool". The power of dark
   and titanic suggestion in this unexplained mystery was enormous; and I
   was not surprised when the thing came out in book form, with two errors
   of astronomical nature removed. Later Merritt had two more things in
   the All-Story, both inferior, and showing the devitalising pressure of
   the cheap popular-magazine ideal. Given a free hand, I feel that this
   writer could snap back into his old mood and 'beat any other weird
   author in the current magazine field; and I wish there were a way of
   getting in touch with him. Another man with promise is Philip M.
   Pisher, Jr., who had a fine thing in a recent ALL-STORY, spoiled only
   by a tame ending obviously designed to suit the gentle Bob Davis. Told
   to let the human race go to hell, Pisher could accomplish wonders. His
   tale was called "Fungus Island". Then there were some old-timers whom I
   recall only dimly. Victor Rousseau was an ALL-STORY star of the first
   magnitude, who wrote at least one noxiously powerful thing called "The
   Sea-Demons". Street and Smith in 1919 published a magazine called THE
   THRILL BOOK, which, although I unfortunately never saw it, is spoken of
   very highly by those who did see it. Some of its writers must be useful
   hands to have around WEIRD TALES, and I think they would be worth
   looking up unless my informant greatly exaggerated. This some
   informant, by the way, is quite certain that the best story in the
   November WEIRD TALES is pilfered word for word from a story in that
   magazine--"The Crawling Death", by P.A. Connolly. I think he wrote Mr.
   Baird about it, and he is still uncertain whether it was an out-and-out
   steal, or a case of-the same writer selling his work twice on the
   chance that THE THRILL BOOK was too short-lived to be remembered.

   But I certainly have rambled enough! I shall be very glad to see the
   cheque when it comes, though well knowing that my own straits are
   shared more or less by everybody else all. along the line! I hope the
   difficulty of payment doesn't deter any first-rate writers from
   contributing ... I suggested to Mr. Baird that it might have exactly
   the-opposite effect, scaring off the mercenaries, and leaving those
   artistic writers who draw horror for horror's sake!
   With all good wishes and appreciations, believe me,

   most sincerely yours,
   H. P. Lovecraft

   12043Letter to Clark Ashton Smith, November 27, 1927H. P. Lovecraft

   I have had no chance to produce new material this autumn, but have been
   classifying notes & synopses in preparation for some monstrous tales
   later on. In particular I have drawn up some data on the celebrated &
   unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred! It seems
   that this shocking blasphemy was produced by a native of Sanaá, in
   Yemen, who flourished about 700 A.D. & made many mysterious pilgrimages
   to Babylon's ruins, Memphis's catacombs, & the devil-haunted &
   untrodden wastes of the great southern deserts of Arabia -- the Roba el
   Khaliyeh, where he claimed to have found records of things older than
   mankind, & to have learnt the worship of Yog-Sothoth & Cthulhu. The
   book was a product of Abdul's old age, which was spent in Damascus, &
   the original title was Al Azif -- azif (cf. Henley's notes to Vathek)
   being the name applied to those strange night noises (of insects) which
   the Arabs attribute to the howling of daemons. Alhazred died -- or
   disappeared -- under terrible circumstances in the year 738. In 950 Al
   Azif was translated into Greek by the Byzantine Theodorus Philetas
   under the title Necronomicon, & a century later it was burnt at the
   order of Michael, Patriarch of Constantinople. It was translated into
   Latin by Olaus in 1228, but placed on the Index Expurgatorius by Pope
   Gregory IX in 1232. The original Arabic was lost before Olaus' time, &
   the last known Greek copy perished in Salem in 1692. The work was
   printed in the 15th, 16th, & 17th centuries, but few copies are extant.
   Wherever existing, it is carefully guarded for the sake of the world's
   welfare & sanity. Once a man read through the copy in the library of
   Miskatonic University at Arkham -- read it through & fled wild-eyed
   into the hills... but that is another story!

   This work is in the public domain in the United States because it was
   legally published within the United States (or the United Nations
   Headquarters in New York subject to Section 7 of the United States

   9570Letter to the Gallomo, December 11, 1919H. P. Lovecraft

   Before quitting the subject of Loveman and horror stories, I must
   relate the frightful dream I had the night after I received S.L.'s
   latest letter. We have lately been discussing weird tales at length,
   and he has recommended several hair-raising books to me; so that I was
   in the mood to connect him with any thought of hideousness or
   supernatural terror. I do not recall how this dream began, or what it
   was really all about. There remains in my mind only one damnably
   blood-curdling fragment whose ending haunts me yet. We were, for some
   terrible yet unknown reason, in a very strange and very ancient
   cemetery - which I could not identify. I suppose no Wisconsinite can
   picture such a thing - but we have them in New England; horrible old
   places where the slate stones are graven with odd letters and grotesque
   designs such as a skull and crossbones. In some of these places one can
   walk a long way without coming upon any grave less than an hundred and
   fifty years old. Some day, when Cook issues that promised MONADNOCK,
   you will see my tale "The Tomb", which was inspired by one of these
   places. Such was the scene of my dream - a hideous hollow whose surface
   was covered with a coarse, repulsive sort of long grass, above which
   peeped the shocking stones and markers of decaying slate. In a hillside
   were several tombs whose facades were in the last stages of
   decrepitude. I had an odd idea that no living thing had trodden that
   ground for many centuries till Loveman and I arrived. It was very late
   in the night - probably in the small hours, since a waning crescent
   moon had attained considerable height in the east. Loveman carried,
   slung over his shoulder, a portable telephone outfit; whilst I bore two
   spades. We proceeded directly to a flat sepulchre near the centre of
   the horrible place, and began to clear away the moss-grown earth which
   had been washed down upon it by the rains of innumerable years.
   Loveman, in the dream, looked exactly like the snapshots of himself
   which he has sent me - a large, robust young man, not the least Semitic
   in features (albeit dark), and very handsome save for a pair of
   protruding ears. We did not speak as he laid down his telephone outfit,
   took a shovel, and helped me clear away the earth and weeds. We both
   seemed very much impressed with something - almost awestruck. At last
   we completed these preliminaries, and Loveman stepped back to survey
   the sepulchre. He seemed to know exactly what he was about to do, and I
   also had an idea - though I cannot now remember what it was! All I
   recall is that we were following up some idea which Loveman had gained
   as the result of extensive reading in some old rare books, of which he
   possessed the only existing copies. (Loveman, you may know, has a vast
   library of rare first editions and other treasures precious to the
   bibliophile's heart.) After some mental estimates, Loveman took up his
   shovel again, and using it as a lever, sought to pry up a certain slab
   which formed the top of the sepulchre. He did not succeed, so I
   approached and helped him with my own shovel. Finally we loosened the
   stone, lifted it with our combined strength, and heaved it away.
   Beneath was a black passageway with a flight of stone steps; but so
   horrible were the miasmic vapours which poured up from the pit, that we
   stepped back for a while without making further observations. Then
   Loveman picked up the telephone output and began to uncoil the wire -
   speaking for the first time as he did so.

   "I'm really sorry", he said in a mellow, pleasant voice; cultivated,
   and not very deep, "to have to ask you to stay above ground, but I
   couldn't answer for the consequences if you were to go down with me.
   Honestly, I doubt if anyone with a nervous system like yours could see
   it through. You can't imagine what I shall have to see and do - not
   even from what the book said and from what I have told you - and I
   don't think anyone without iron-clad nerves could ever go down and come
   out of that place alive and sane. At any rate, this is no place for
   anybody who can't pass an army physical examination. I discovered this
   thing, and I am responsible in a way for anyone who goes with me - so I
   would not for a thousand dollars let you take the risk. But I'll keep
   you informed of every move I make by the telephone - you see I've
   enough wire to reach to the centre of the earth and back!"

   I argued with him, but he replied that if I did not agree, he would
   call the thing off and get another fellowexplorer - he mentioned a "Dr.
   Burke," a name altogether unfamiliar to me. He added, that it would be
   of no use for me to descend alone, since he was sole possessor of the
   real key to the affair. Finally I assented, and seated myself upon a
   marble bench close by the open grave, telephone in hand. He produced an
   electric lantern, prepared the telephone wire for unreeling, and
   disappeared down the damp stone steps, the insulated wire rustling as
   it uncoiled. For a moment I kept track of the glow of his lantern, but
   suddenly it faded out, as if there were a turn in the stone staircase.
   Then all was still. After this came a period of dull fear and anxious
   waiting. The crescent moon climbed higher, and the mist or fog about
   the hollow seemed to thicken. Everything was horribly damp and bedewed,
   and I thought I saw an owl flitting somewhere in the shadows. Then a
   clicking sounded in the telephone receiver.

   "Lovecraft - I think I'm finding it" - the words came in a tense,
   excited tone. Then a brief pause, followed by more words in atone of
   ineffable awe and horror.

   "God, Lovecraft! If you could see what I am seeing!" I now asked in
   great excitement what had happened. Loveman answered in a trembling
   voice: "I can't tell you - I don't dare - I never dreamed of this - I
   can't tell - It's enough to unseat any mind - wait - what's this?" Then
   a pause, a clicking in the receiver, and a sort of despairing groan.
   Speech again - "Lovecraft - for God's sake - it's all up - Beat it!
   Beat it! Don't lose a second!" I was now thoroughly alarmed, and
   frantically asked Loveman to tell what the matter was. He replied only
   "Never mind! Hurry!" Then I felt a sort of offence through my fear - it
   irked me that anyone should assume that I would be willing to desert a
   companion in peril. I disregarded his advice and told him I was coming
   down to his aid. But he cried:

   "Don't be a fool - it's too late - there's no use - nothing you or
   anyone can do now." He seemed calmer - with a terrible, resigned calm,
   as if he had met and recognised an inevitable, inescapable doom. Yet he
   was obviously anxious that I should escape some unknown peril.

   "For God's sake get out of this, if you can find the way! I'm not
   joking - So long, Lovecraft, won't see you again - God! Beat it! Beat
   it!" As he shrieked out the last words, his tone was a frenzied
   crescendo. I have tried to recall the wording as nearly as possible,
   but I cannot reproduce the tone. There followed a long - hideously long
   - period of silence. I tried to move to assist Loveman, but was
   absolutely paralysed. The slightest motion was an impossibility. I
   could speak, however, and kept calling excitedly into the telephone -
   "Loveman! Loveman! What is it? What's the trouble?" But he did not
   reply. And then came the unbelievably frightful thing - the awful,
   unexplainable, almost unmentionable thing. I have said that Loveman was
   now silent, but after a vast interval of terrified waiting another
   clicking came into the receiver. I called "Loveman - are you there?"
   And in reply came a voice - a thing which I cannot describe by any
   words I know. Shall I say that it was hollow - very deep - fluid -
   gelatinous - indefinitely distant - unearthly - guttural - thick? What
   shall I say? In that telephone I heard it; heard it as I sat on a
   marble bench in that very ancient unknown cemetery with the crumbling
   stones and tombs and long grass and dampness and the owl and the waning
   crescent moon. Up from the sepulchre it came, and this is what it said:

   "YOU FOOL, LOVEMAN IS DEAD!"

   Well, that's the whole damn thing! I fainted in the dream, and the next
   I knew I was awake - and with a prize headache! I don't know yet what
   it was all about - what on (or under) earth we were looking for, or
   what that hideous voice at the last was supposed to be. I have read of
   ghouls - mould shades - but hell - the headache I had was worse than
   the dream! Loveman will laugh when I tell him about that dream! In due
   time, I intend to weave this picture into a story, as I wove another
   dream-picture into "The Doom that Came to Sarnath". I wonder, though,
   if I have a right to claim authorship of things I dream? I hate to take
   credit, when I did not really think out the picture with my own
   conscious wits. Yet if I do not take credit, who'n Heaven will I give
   credit tuh? Coleridge claimed "Kubla Khan", so I guess I'll claim the
   thing an' let it go at that. But believe muh, that was some dream!

   Life's Mystery (Lovecraft)

   Life! Ah, Life!

   What may this fluorescent pageant mean?

   Who can the evanescent object glean?

   He that is dead is the key of Life -

   Gone is the symbol, deep is the grave!

   Man is a breath, and Life is the fire;

   Birth is death, and silence the choir

   Wrest from the aeons the heart of gold!

   Tear from the fabric the threads that are old!

   Life! Ah, Life!

   Published 18 May 1916.
   9415Lines on Gen. Robert Edward LeeH. P. Lovecraft

   Si veris magna paratur
   Fama bonis, et se successu nuda remoto
   Inspicitur virtus, quicquid laudamus in ullo
   Majorum, ortuna fuit.
   - Lucan

   Whilst martial echoes o'er the wave resound,
   And Europe's gore incarnadines the ground;
   Today no foreign hero we bemoan,
   But count the glowing virtues of our own!
   illustrious LEE! around whose honour'd name
   Entwines a patriot's and a Christian's fame;
   With whose just praise admiring nations ring,
   And whom repenting foes contritely sing!
   When first our land fraternal fury bore,
   And Sumter's guns alarm'd the anxious shore;
   When Faction's reign ancestral rights o'erthrew,
   And sunder'd States a mutual hatred knew;
   Then clash'd contending chiefs of kindred line,
   In flesh to suffer and in fame to shine.
   But o'er them all, majestic in his might,
   Rose LEE, unrivall'd, to sublimest height:
   With torturing choice defy'd opposing Fate,
   And shunn'd Temptation for his native State!
   Thus Washington his monarch's rule o'erturned
   When young Columbia with rebellion burn'd.
   And what in Washington the world reveres,
   In LEE with equal magnitude appears.
   Our nation's Father, crown'd with vict'ry bays,
   Enjoys a loving land's eternal praise:
   Let, then, our hearts with equal rev'rence greet
   His proud successor, rising o'er defeat!
   Around his greatness pour disheart'ning woes,
   But still he tow'rs above his conquering foes.
   Silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blame
   Th' unspotted leader by a traitor's name.
   If such was LEE, let blushing Justice mourn,
   And trait'rous Liberty endure our scorn!
   As Philopoemen once sublimely strove,
   And earn'd declining Hellas' thankful love;
   So followed LEE the purest patriot's part,
   And wak'd the worship of the grateful heart:
   The South her soul in body'd form discerns;
   The North from LEE a nobler freedom learns!
   Attend! ye sons of Albion's ancient race,
   Whate'er your country, and whate'er your place;
   LEE'S valiant deeds, though dear to Southern song,
   To all our Saxon strain as well belong,
   Courage like his the parent Island won,
   And led an Empire past the setting sun;
   To realms unknown our laws and language bore,
   Rais'd England's banner on the desert shore;
   Crush'd the proud rival, and subdued the sea
   For ages past, and aeons yet to be!
   From Scotia's hilly bounds the paean rolls,
   And Afric's distant Cape great LEE extols;
   The sainted soul and manly mien combine
   To grace Britannia's and Virginia's line
   As dullards now in thoughtless fervour prate
   Of shameful peace, and sing th' unmanly State;
   As churls their piping reprobations shriek,
   And damn the heroes that protect the weak;
   Let LEE'S brave shade the timid throng accost,
   And give them back the manhood they have lost!
   What kindlier spirit, breathing from on high,
   Can teach us how to live and how to die?

   7582MemoryH.P. Lovecraft

   In the valley of Nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly, tearing a
   path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a
   great upas-tree. And within the depths of the valley, where the light
   reaches not, move forms not meant to be beheld. Rank is the herbage on
   each slope, where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the
   stones of ruined palaces, twining tightly about broken columns and
   strange monoliths, and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten
   hands. And in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap
   little apes, while in and out of deep treasure-vaults writhe poison
   serpents and scaly things without a name. Vast are the stones which
   sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss, and mighty were the walls from
   which they fell. For all time did their builders erect them, and in
   sooth they yet serve nobly, for beneath them the grey toad makes his
   habitation.
         At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose
   waters are slimy and filled with weeds. From hidden springs it rises,
   and to subterranean grottoes it flows, so that the Daemon of the Valley
   knows not why its waters are red, nor whither they are bound.
         The Genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the Daemon of the
   Valley, saying, "I am old, and forget much. Tell me the deeds and
   aspect and name of them who built these things of Stone." And the
   Daemon replied, "I am Memory, and am wise in lore of the past, but I
   too am old. These beings were like the waters of the river Than, not to
   be understood. Their deeds I recall not, for they were but of the
   moment. Their aspect I recall dimly, it was like to that of the little
   apes in the trees. Their name I recall clearly, for it rhymed with that
   of the river. These beings of yesterday were called Man."
         So the Genie flew back to the thin horned moon, and the Daemon
   looked intently at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling
   courtyard.

Metrical Regularity

   Metrical Regularity
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Published July 1915.
   9569Metrical RegularityH. P. Lovecraft

                "Deteriores omnes sumus licentia." - Terence

   Of the various forms of decadence manifest in the poetical art of the
   present age, none strikes more harshly on our sensibilities than the
   alarming decline in that harmonious regularity of metre which adorned
   the poetry of our immediate ancestors.

   That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a
   principle which not even the assertions of an Aristotle or the
   pronouncements of a Plato can disestablish. As old a critic as
   Dionysius of Halicarnassus and as modern an philosopher as Hegel have
   each affirmed that versification in poetry is not alone a necessary
   attribute, but the very foundation as well; Hegel, indeed, placing
   metre above metaphorical imagination as the essence of all poetic
   creation.

   Science can likewise trace the metrical instinct from the very infancy
   of mankind, or even beyond, to the pre-human age of the apes. Nature is
   in itself an unending succession of regular impulses. The steady
   recurrence of the seasons and of the moonlight, the coming and going of
   the day, the ebb and flow of the tides, the beating of the heart and
   pulses, the tread of the feet in walking, the countless other phenomena
   of like regularity, have all combined to inculcate in the human brain a
   rhythmic sense which is as manifest in the most uncultivated, as in the
   most polished of peoples. Metre, therefore, is no such false artifice
   as most exponents of radicalism would have us believe, but is instead a
   natural and inevitable embellishment to poesy, which succeeding ages
   should develop and refine, rather than maim or destroy.

   Like other instincts, the metric sense has taken on different aspects
   among different races. Savages show it in its simplest form while
   dancing to the sound of primitive drums; barbarians display it in their
   religious and other chantings; civilized peoples utilize it for their
   formal poetry, either as measured quantity, like that of Greek and
   Roman verse, or as measured accentual stress, like that of our own
   English verse. Precision of metre is thus no mere display of
   meretricious ornament, but a logical evolution from eminently natural
   sources.

   It is the contention of the ultra-modern poet, as enunciated by Mrs. J.
   W. Renshaw in her recent article on "The Autocracy of Art," (The
   Looking Glass for May) that the truly inspired bard must chant forth
   his feelings independently of form or language, permitting each
   changing impulse to alter the rhythm of his lay, and blindly resigning
   his reason to the "fine frenzy" of his mood. This contention is of
   course founded upon the assumption that poetry is super-intellectual;
   the expression of a "soul" which outranks the mind and its precepts.
   Now while avoiding the impeachment of this dubious theory, we must
   needs remark that the laws of Nature cannot so easily be outdistanced.
   However much true poesy may overtop the produce of the brain, it must
   still be affected by natural laws, which are universal and inevitable.
   Wherefore it is the various clearly defined natural forms through which
   the emotions seek expression. Indeed, we feel even unconsciously the
   fitness of certain types of metre for certain types of thought, and in
   perusing a crude or irregular poem are often abruptly repelled by the
   unwarranted variations made by the bard, either through his ignorance
   or his perverted taste. We are naturally shocked at the clothing of a
   grave subject in anapestic metre, or the treatment of a long and lofty
   theme in short, choppy lines. This latter defect is what repels us so
   much from Coninghton's really scholarly translation of the Aeneid.

   What the radicals so wantonly disregard in their eccentric performances
   is unity of thought. Amidst their wildly repeated leaps from one rough
   metre to another, they ignore the underlying uniformity of each of
   their poems. Scene may change; atmosphere may vary; yet one poem cannot
   carry but one definite message, and to suit this ultimate and
   fundamental message but one metre must be selected and sustained. To
   accommodate the minor inequalities of tone in a poem, one regular metre
   will amply lend itself to diversity. Our chief but now annoyingly
   neglected measure, the heroic couplet, is capable of taking on the
   infinite shades of expression by the right selection of sequence of
   words, and by the proper placing of the caesura or pause in each line.
   Dr. Blair, in his 38th lecture, explains and illustrates with admirable
   perspicuity the importance of the caesura's location in varying the
   flow of heroic verse. It is also possible to lend variety to a poem by
   using very judiciously occasional feet of a metre different from that
   of the body of the work. This is generally done without disturbing the
   syllabification, and it in no way impairs or obscures the dominant
   measure.

   Most amusing of all the claims of the radical is the assertion that
   true poetic fervor can never be confined to regular metre; that the
   wild-eyed, long-haired rider of Pegasus must inflict upon a suffering
   public in unaltered form the vague conceptions which flit in noble
   chaos through his exalted soul. While it is perfectly obvious that the
   hour of rare inspiration must be improved without the hindrance of
   grammars or rhyming dictionaries, it is no less obvious that the
   succeeding hour of calmer contemplation may very profitably be devoted
   to amendment and polishing. The "language of the heart" must be
   clarified and made intelligible to other hearts, else its purport will
   forever be confined to its creator. If natural laws of metrical
   construction be willfully set aside, the reader's attention will be
   distracted from the soul of the poem to its uncouth and ill-fitting
   dress. The more nearly perfect the metre, the less conspicuous its
   presence; hence if the poet desires supreme consideration for his
   matter, he should make his verses so smooth that the sense may never be
   interrupted.

   The ill effect of metrical laxity on the younger generation of poets is
   enormous. These latest suitors of the Muse, not yet sufficiently
   trained to distinguish between their own artless crudities and the
   cultivated monstrosities of the educated but radical bard, come to
   regard with distrust the orthodox critics, and to believe that no
   grammatical, rhetorical, or metrical skill is necessary to their own
   development. The result cannot but be a race of churlish, cacophonous
   hybrids, whose amorphous outcries will waver uncertainly betwixt prose
   and verse, absorbing the vices of both and the virtues of neither.

   When proper consideration shall be taken of the perfect naturalness of
   polished metre, a wholesome reaction against the present chaos must
   inevitably occur; so that the few remaining disciples of conservatism
   and good taste may justly entertain one last, lingering hope of hearing
   from modern lyres the stately heroics of Pope, the majestic blank verse
   of Thomson, the terse octosyllabics of Swift, the sonorous quatrains of
   Gray, and the lively anapests of Sheridan and Moore.

   14869NathicanaH.P. Lovecraft

Nathicana[edit]

   by H.P. Lovecraft
   and Alfred Galpin

   It was in the pale garden of Zais;
   The mist-shrouded gardens of Zais,
   Where blossoms the white naphalot,
   The redolent herald of midnight.
   There slumber the still lakes of crystal,
   And streamlets that flow without murm'ring;
   Smooth streamlets from caverns of Kathos
   Where broodth the calm spirits of twilight.
   And over the lakes and the streamlets
   Are bridges of pure alabaster,
   White bridges all cunningly carven
   With figures of fairies and daemons.
   Here glimmer strange suns and strange planets,
   And strange is the crescent Bnapis
   That sets 'yond the ivy-grown ramparts
   Where thicken the dusk of the evening.
   Here fall the white vapours of Yabon;
   And here in the swirl of vapours
   I saw the divine Nathicana;
   The garlanded, white Nathicana;
   The slow-eyed, red-lipped Nathicana;
   The silver-voiced, sweet Nathicana;
   The pale-rob'd, belov'd Nathicana
   And ever was she my beloved,
   From ages when time was unfashioned
   Now anything fashion'd but Yabon.
   And here dwelt we ever and ever,
   The innocent children of Zais,
   At peace in the paths and the arbours,
   White-crowned with the blest nephalote.
   How oft would we float in the twilight
   O'er flow'r-cover'd pastures and hillsides
   All white with the lowly astalthon;
   The lowly yet lovely astalthon,
   And dream in a world made of dreaming
   The dreams that are fairer than Aidenn;
   Bright dreams that are truer than reason!
   So dreamed and so lov'd we thro' ages,
   Till came the cursed season of Dzannin;
   The daemon-damn'd season of Dzannin;
   When red shone the suns and the planets,
   And red leamed the crescent Banapis,
   And red fell the vapours of Yabon.
   Then redden'd the blossoms and streamlets
   And lakes that lay under the bridges,
   And even the calm alabaster
   glowed pink with uncanny reflections
   Till all the carv'd fairies and daemons
   Leer'd redly from the backgrounds of shadow.
   Now redden'd my vision, and madly
   I strove to peer thro' the dense curtain
   And glimpsed the divine Nathicana;
   The pure, ever-pale Nathicana;
   The lov'd, the unchang'd Nathicana.
   But vortex on vortex of madness
   Beclouded my labouring vision;
   My damnable, reddening vision
   That built a new world for my seeing;
   A new world of redness and darkness,
   A horrible coma call'd living
   So now in this coma call'd living
   I view the bright phantons of beauty;
   The false hollow phantoms of beauty
   That cloak all the evils of Dzannin.
   I view them with infinite longing,
   So like do they seem to my lov'd one:
   Yet foul for their eyes shines their evil;
   Their cruel and pitiless evil,
   More evil than Thaphron and Latgoz,
   Twice ill fro its gorgeous concealment.
   And only in slumbers of midnight
   Appears the lost maid Nathicana,
   The pallid, the pure Nathicana
   Who fades at the glance of the dreamer.
   Again and again do I seek her;
   I woo with deep draughts of Plathotis,
   Deep draughts brew'd in wine of Astarte
   And strengthen'd with tears of long weeping.
   I yearn for the gardens of Zais;
   The lovely, lost garden of Zais
   Where blossoms the white nephalot,
   The redolent herald of midnight.
   The last potent draught am I brewing;
   A draught that the daemons delight in;
   A draught that will banish the redness;
   The horrible coma call'd living.
   Soon, soon, if I fail not in brewing,
   The redness and madness will vanish,
   And deep in the worm-people'd darkness
   Will rot the base chains that have bound me.
   Once more shall the gardens of Zais
   Dawn white on my long-tortur'd vision,
   And there midst the vapours of Yabon
   Will stand the divine Nathicana;
   The deathless, restor'd Nathicana
   Whose like is not met with in living.

     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   1 November 1917
   9471NemesisH. P. Lovecraft1917

   Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,
     Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,
   I have lived o'er my lives without number,
     I have sounded all things with my sight;
   And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness
   with fright.
   I have whirled with the earth at the dawning,
     When the sky was a vaporous flame;
   I have seen the dark universe yawning
     Where the black planets roll without aim,
   Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre
   or name.
   I had drifted o'er seas without ending,
     Under sinister grey-clouded skies,
   That the many-forked lightning is rending,
     That resound with hysterical cries;
   With the moans of invisible daemons, that out of the green waters rise.
   I have plunged like a deer through the arches
     Of the hoary primordial grove,
   Where the oaks feel the presence that marches,
     And stalks on where no spirit dares rove,
   And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers through dead
   branches above.
   I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains
     That rise barren and bleak from the plain,
   I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains
     That ooze down to the marsh and the main;
   And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things, I care not to gaze on
   again.
   I have scanned the vast ivy-clad palace,
     I have trod its untenanted hall,
   Where the moon rising up from the valleys
     Shows the tapestried things on the wall;
   Strange figures discordantly woven, that I cannot endure to recall.
   I have peered from the casements in wonder
     At the mouldering meadows around,
   At the many-roofed village laid under
     The curse of a grave-girdled ground;
   And from rows of white urn-carven marble, I listen intently for sound.
   I have haunted the tombs of the ages,
     I have flown on the pinions of fear,
   Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages;
     Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:
   And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can
   cheer.
   I was old when the pharaohs first mounted
     The jewel-decked throne by the Nile;
   I was old in those epochs uncounted
     When I, and I only, was vile;
   And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic
   isle.
   Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,
     And great is the reach of its doom;
   Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it,
     Nor can respite be found in the tomb:
   Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.
   Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,
     Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,
   I have lived o'er my lives without number,
     I have sounded all things with my sight;
   And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness
   with fright.

   Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,
   But every night I see the rubbery things,
   Black, horned, and slender, with membranous wings,
   They come in legions on the north wind's swell
   With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,
   Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings
   To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare's well.
   Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep,
   Heedless of all the cries I try to make,
   And down the nether pits to that foul lake
   Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.
   But ho! If only they would make some sound,
   Or wear a face where faces should be found!

   Notes on Writing Weird Fiction  (1933)
   by H.P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Written in 1933, published in the June 1937 issue of the Amateur
   Correspondent.
   200728Notes on Writing Weird FictionH.P. Lovecraft1933

   My reason for writing stories is to give myself the satisfaction of
   visualising more clearly and detailedly and stably the vague, elusive,
   fragmentary impressions of wonder, beauty, and adventurous expectancy
   which are conveyed to me by certain sights (scenic, architectural,
   atmospheric, etc.), ideas, occurrences, and images encountered in art
   and literature. I choose weird stories because they suit my inclination
   best--one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve,
   momentarily, the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of
   the galling limitations of time, space, and natural law which forever
   imprison us and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic
   spaces beyond the radius of our sight and analysis. These stories
   frequently emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest
   and strongest emotion, and the one which best lends itself to the
   creation of Nature-defying illusions. Horror and the unknown or the
   strange are always closely connected, so that it is hard to create a
   convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or
   "outsideness" without laying stress on the emotion of fear. The reason
   why time plays a great part in so many of my tales is that this element
   looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible
   thing in the universe. Conflict with time seems to me the most potent
   and fruitful theme in all human expression.
         While my chosen form of story-writing is obviously a special and
   perhaps a narrow one, it is none the less a persistent and permanent
   type of expression, as old as literature itself. There will always be a
   certain small percentage of persons who feel a burning curiosity about
   unknown outer space, and a burning desire to escape from the
   prison-house of the known and the real into those enchanted lands of
   incredible adventure and infinite possibilities which dreams open up to
   us, and which things like deep woods, fantastic urban towers, and
   flaming sunsets momentarily suggest. These persons include great
   authors as well as insignificant amateurs like myself--Dunsany, Poe,
   Arthur Machen, M. R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Walter de la Mare
   being typical masters in this field.
         As to how I write a story--there is no one way. Each one of my
   tales has a different history. Once or twice I have literally written
   out a dream; but usually I start with a mood or idea or image which I
   wish to express, and revolve it in my mind until I can think of a good
   way of embodying it in some chain of dramatic occurrences capable of
   being recorded in concrete terms. I tend to run through a mental list
   of the basic conditions or situations best adapted to such a mood or
   idea or image, and then begin to speculate on logical and naturally
   motivated explanations of the given mood or idea or image in terms of
   the basic condition or situation chosen.
         The actual process of writing is of course as varied as the
   choice of theme and initial conception; but if the history of all my
   tales were analysed, it is just possible that the following set of
   rules might be deduced from the average procedure:
    1. Prepare a synopsis or scenario of events in the order of their
       absolute occurrence--not the order of their narration. Describe
       with enough fulness to cover all vital points and motivate all
       incidents planned. Details, comments, and estimates of consequences
       are sometimes desirable in this temporary framework.
    2. Prepare a second synopsis or scenario of events--this one in order
       of narration (not actual occurrence), with ample fulness and
       detail, and with notes as to changing perspective, stresses, and
       climax. Change the original synopsis to fit if such a change will
       increase the dramatic force or general effectiveness of the story.
       Interpolate or delete incidents at will--never being bound by the
       original conception even if the ultimate result be a tale wholly
       different from that first planned. Let additions and alterations be
       made whenever suggested by anything in the for mulating process.
    3. Write out the story--rapidly, fluently, and not too
       critically--following the second or narrative-order synopsis.
       Change incidents and plot whenever the developing process seems to
       suggest such change, never being bound by any previous design. If
       the development suddenly reveals new opportunities for dramatic
       effect or vivid story telling, add whatever is thought
       advantageous--going back and reconciling the early parts to the new
       plan. Insert and delete whole sections if necessary or desirable,
       trying different beginnings and endings until the best arrangement
       is found. But be sure that all references throughout the story are
       thoroughly reconciled with the final design. Remove all possible
       superfluities--words, sentences, paragraphs, or whole episodes or
       elements--observing the usual precautions about the reconciling of
       all references.
    4. Revise the entire text, paying attention to vocabulary, syntax,
       rhythm of prose, proportioning of parts, niceties of tone, grace
       and convincingness of transitions (scene to scene, slow and
       detailed action to rapid and sketchy time-covering action and vice
       versa... etc., etc., etc.), effectiveness of beginning, ending,
       climaxes, etc., dramatic suspense and interest, plausibility and
       atmosphere, and various other elements.
    5. Prepare a neatly typed copy--not hesitating to add final revisory
       touches where they seem in order.

   The first of these stages is often purely a mental one--a set of
   conditions and happenings being worked out in my head, and never set
   down until I am ready to prepare a detailed synopsis of events in order
   of narration. Then, too, I sometimes begin even the actual writing
   before I know how I shall develop the idea--this beginning forming a
   problem to be motivated and exploited.
         There are, I think, four distinct types of weird story; one
   expressing a mood or feeling, another expressing a pictorial
   conception, a third expressing a general situation, condition, legend
   or intellectual conception, and a fourth explaining a definite tableau
   or specific dramatic situation or climax. In another way, weird tales
   may be grouped into two rough categories--those in which the marvel or
   horror concerns some condition or phenomenon, and those in which it
   concerns some action of persons in connexion with a bizarre condition
   or phenomenon.
         Each weird story--to speak more particularly of the horror
   type--seems to involve five definite elements: (a) some basic,
   underlying horror or abnormality--condition, entity, etc.--, (b) the
   general effects or bearings of the horror, (c) the mode of
   manifestation--object embodying the horror and phenomena observed--,
   (d) the types of fear-reaction pertaining to the horror, and (e) the
   specific effects of the horror in relation to the given set of
   conditions.
         In writing a weird story I always try very carefully to achieve
   the right mood and atmosphere, and place the emphasis where it belongs.
   One cannot, except in immature pulp charlatan-fiction, present an
   account of impossible, improbable, or inconceivable phenomena as a
   commonplace narrative of objective acts and conventional emotions.
   Inconceivable events and conditions have a special handicap to over
   come, and this can be accomplished only through the maintenance of a
   careful realism in every phase of the story except that touching on the
   one given marvel. This marvel must be treated very impressively and
   deliberately--with a careful emotional "build-up"--else it will seem
   flat and unconvincing. Being the principal thing in the story, its mere
   existence should overshadow the characters and events. But the
   characters and events must be consistent and natural except where they
   touch the single marvel. In relation to the central wonder, the
   characters should shew the same overwhelming emotion which similar
   characters would shew toward such a wonder in real life. Never have a
   wonder taken for granted. Even when the characters are supposed to be
   accustomed to the wonder I try to weave an air of awe and
   impressiveness corresponding to what the reader should feel. A casual
   style ruins any serious fantasy.
         Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird
   fiction. Indeed, all that a wonder story can ever be is a vivid picture
   of a certain type of human mood. The moment it tries to be anything
   else it becomes cheap, puerile, and unconvincing. Prime emphasis should
   be given to subtle suggestion--imperceptible hints and touches of
   selective associative detail which express shadings of moods and build
   up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the unreal. Avoid bald
   catalogues of incredible happenings which can have no substance or
   meaning apart from a sustaining cloud of colour and symbolism.
         These are the rules or standards which I have
   followed--consciously or unconsciously--ever since I first attempted
   the serious writing of fantasy. That my results are successful may well
   be disputed--but I feel at least sure that, had I ignored the
   considerations mentioned in the last few paragraphs, they would have
   been much worse than they are.

   6404NyarlathotepH. P. Lovecraft

   Nyarlathotep . . . the crawling chaos . . . I am the last . . . I will
   tell the audient void. . . .

   I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The
   general tension was horrible. To a season of political and social
   upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous
   physical danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger
   as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night. I
   recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces, and
   whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat
   or acknowledge to himself that he had heard. A sense of monstrous guilt
   was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill
   currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a
   daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons -- the autumn heat
   lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the
   universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of
   gods or forces which were unknown.

   And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none
   could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a
   Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why.
   He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries,
   and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the
   lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and
   sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and
   combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the
   sciences - of electricity and psychology -- and gave exhibitions of
   power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his
   fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see
   Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest
   vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare.
   Never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem;
   now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small
   hours, that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale,
   pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges, and
   old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky.

   I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city -- the great, the old, the
   terrible city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and
   of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I
   burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend
   said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered
   imaginings; and what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room
   prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and in the
   sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never
   been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes. And I heard it
   hinted abroad that those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which
   others saw not.

   It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the
   restless crowds to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up
   the endless stairs into the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I
   saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from
   behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world battling against
   blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space;
   whirling, churning, struggling around the dimming, cooling sun. Then
   the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and
   hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came
   out and squatted on the heads. And when I, who was colder and more
   scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest about "imposture"
   and "static electricity," Nyarlathotep drove us all out, down the dizzy
   stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud
   that I was not afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others
   screamed with me for solace. We swore to one another that the city was
   exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began
   to fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the
   queer faces we made.

   I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for
   when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious
   involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations
   though we dared not think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and
   found the blocks loose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of
   rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run. And again we saw a
   tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side. When
   we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the
   river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged
   at the top. Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed
   drawn in a different direction. One disappeared in a narrow alley to
   the left, leaving only the echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down
   a weed-choked subway entrance, howling with a laughter that was mad. My
   own column was sucked toward the open country, and presently I felt a
   chill which was not of the hot autumn; for as we stalked out on the
   dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter of evil snows.
   Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder in one direction only,
   where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls. The column
   seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf. I
   lingered behind, for the black rift in the green-litten snow was
   frightful, and I thought I had heard the reverberations of a
   disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my power to linger was
   slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half-floated
   between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the
   sightless vortex of the unimaginable.

   Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can
   tell. A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not
   hands, and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation,
   corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that
   brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds
   vague ghosts of monstrous things; half-seen columns of unsanctified
   temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy
   vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. And through this
   revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of
   drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from
   inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding
   and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the
   gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods -- the blind, voiceless, mindless
   gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep.

   As Columbia's brave scions, in anger array'd,
    Once defy'd a proud monarch and built a new nation;
   `Gainst their brothers of Britain unsheath'd the sharp blade
    That hath ne'er met defeat nor endur'd desecration;
     So must we in this hour
     Show our valour and pow'r,
   And dispel the black perils that over us low'r:
    Whilst the sons of Britannia, no longer our foes,
    Will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows!
   See the banners of Liberty float in the breeze
    That plays light o'er the regions our fathers defended;
   Hear the voice of the million resound o'er the leas,
    As deeds of the past are proclaim'd and commended;
     And in splendour on high
     Where our flags proudly fly,
   See the folds we tore down flung again to the sky:
    For the Emblem of England, in kinship unfurl'd,
    Shall divide with Old Glory the praise of the world!
   Bury'd now are the hatreds of subject and King,
    And the strife that once sunder'd an Empire hath vanish'd.
   With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring
    As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish'd;
     And the broad British sea,
     Of her enemies free,
   Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee:
    For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side,
    Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!

   Old Bugs

   9473Old BugsH. P. Lovecraft

      An Extemporaneous Sob Story by Marcus Lollius, Proconsul of Gaul

   Sheehan's Pool Room, which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart
   of Chicago's stockyard district, is not a nice place. Its air,
   freighted with a thousand odours such as Coleridge may have found at
   Cologne, too seldom knows the purifying rays of the sun; but fights for
   space with the acrid fumes of unnumbered cheap cigars and cigarettes
   which dangle from the coarse lips of unnumbered human animals that
   haunt the place day and night. But the popularity of Sheehan's remains
   unimpaired; and for this there is a reason -- a reason obvious to
   anyone who will take the trouble to analyse the mixed stenches
   prevailing there. Over and above the fumes and sickening closeness
   rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land, but now happily
   banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent
   government -- the aroma of strong, wicked whiskey -- a precious kind of
   forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950.

   Sheehan's is the acknowledged centre to Chicago's subterranean traffic
   in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which
   extends even to the unkempt attaches of the place; but there was until
   lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity -- one who shared
   the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan's. He was
   called "Old Bugs", and was the most disreputable object in a
   disreputable environment. What he had once been, many tried to guess;
   for his language and mode of utterance when intoxicated to a certain
   degree were such as to excite wonderment; but what he was, presented
   less difficulty -- for "Old Bugs", in superlative degree, epitomised
   the pathetic species known as the "bum" or the "down-and-outer". Whence
   he had come, no one could tell. One night he had burst wildly into
   Sheehan's, foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh;
   and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs,
   had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning cuspidors and
   glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange
   for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and
   sane.

   He talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the
   underworld; but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous
   dose of crude whiskey, would burst forth into strings of
   incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse
   which led certain habitués to conjecture that he had seen better days.
   One steady patron -- a bank defaulter under cover -- came to converse
   with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured
   the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day. But the
   only tangible clue to Old Bugs' past was a faded photograph which he
   constantly carried about with him -- the photograph of a young woman of
   noble and beautiful features. This he would sometimes draw from his
   tattered pocket, carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper,
   and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and
   tenderness. It was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen
   would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and quality, garbed
   in the quaint attire of thirty years before. Old Bugs himself seemed
   also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every
   hallmark of antiquity. He was a man of immense height, probably more
   than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this
   fact. His hair, a dirty white and falling out in patches, was never
   combed; and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard
   which seemed always to remain at the bristling stage -- never shaven --
   yet never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers. His
   features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the
   ghastly effects of terrible dissipation. At one time -- probably in
   middle life -- he had evidently been grossly fat; but now he was
   horribly lean, the purple flesh hanging in loose pouches under his
   bleary eyes and upon his cheeks. Altogether, Old Bugs was not pleasing
   to look upon.

   The disposition of Old Bugs was as odd as his aspect. Ordinarily he was
   true to the derelict type -- ready to do anything for a nickel or a
   dose of whiskey or hasheesh -- but at rare intervals he shewed the
   traits which earned him his name. Then he would try to straighten up,
   and a certain fire would creep into the sunken eyes. His demeanour
   would assume an unwonted grace and even dignity; and the sodden
   creatures around him would sense something of superiority -- something
   which made them less ready to give the usual kicks and cuffs to the
   poor butt and drudge. At these times he would shew a sardonic humour
   and make remarks which the folk of Sheehan's deemed foolish and
   irrational. But the spells would soon pass, and once more Old Bugs
   would resume his eternal floorscrubbing and cuspidor-cleaning. But for
   one thing Old Bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishment
   -- and that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced
   for their first drink. The old man would then rise from the floor in
   anger and excitement, muttering threats and warnings, and seeking to
   dissuade the novices from embarking upon their course of "seeing life
   as it is." He would sputter and fume, exploding into sesquipedalian
   admonitions and strange oaths, and animated by a frightful earnestness
   which brought a shudder to more than one drug-racked mind in the
   crowded room. But after a time his alcohol-enfeebled brain would wander
   from the subject, and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to
   his mop or cleaning-rag.

   I do not think that many of Sheehan's regular patrons will ever forget
   the day that young Alfred Trever came. He was rather a "find" -- a rich
   and high-spirited youth who would "go the limit" in anything he
   undertook -- at least, that was the verdict of Pete Schultz, Sheehan's
   "runner", who had come across the boy at Lawrence College, in the small
   town of Appleton, Wisconsin. Trever was the son of prominent parents in
   Appleton. His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of
   distinction, whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a
   poetess under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing. Alfred was himself a
   scholar and poet of distinction, though cursed with a certain childish
   irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for Sheehan's runner. He
   was blond, handsome, and spoiled; vivacious and eager to taste the
   several forms of dissipation about which he had read and heard. At
   Lawrence he had been prominent in the mock-fraternity of "Tappa Tappa
   Keg", where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young
   roysterers; but this immature, collegiate frivolity did not satisfy
   him. He knew deeper vices through books, and he now longed to know them
   at first hand. Perhaps this tendency toward wildness had been
   stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he had been subjected at
   home; for Mrs. Trever had particular reason for training her only child
   with rigid severity. She had, in her own youth, been deeply and
   permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by the case of one
   to whom she had for a time been engaged.

   Young Galpin, the fiancé in question, had been one of Appleton's most
   remarkable sons. Attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful
   mentality, he won vast fame at the University of Wisconsin, and at the
   age of twenty-three returned to Appleton to take up a professorship at
   Lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of Appleton's fairest
   and most brilliant daughter. For a season all went happily, till
   without warning the storm burst. Evil habits, dating from a first drink
   taken years before in woodland seclusion, made themselves manifest in
   the young professor; and only by a hurried resignation did he escape a
   nasty prosecution for injury to the habits and morals of the pupils
   under his charge. His engagement broken, Galpin moved east to begin
   life anew; but before long, Appletonians heard of his dismissal in
   disgrace from New York University, where he had obtained an
   instructorship in English. Galpin now devoted his time to the library
   and lecture platform, preparing volumes and speeches on various
   subjects connected with belles lettres, and always shewing a genius so
   remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon him for
   his past mistakes. His impassioned lectures in defence of Villon, Poe,
   Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde were applied to himself as well, and in the
   short Indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement
   at a certain cultured home on Park Avenue. But then the blow fell. A
   final disgrace, compared to which the others had been as nothing,
   shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in Galpin's
   reform; and the young man abandoned his name and disappeared from
   public view. Rumour now and then associated him with a certain "Consul
   Hasting" whose work for the stage and for motionpicture companies
   attracted a certain degree of attention because of its scholarly
   breadth and depth; but Hasting soon disappeared from the public eye,
   and Galpin became only a name for parents to quote in warning accents.
   Eleanor Wing soon celebrated her marriage to Karl Trever, a rising
   young lawyer, and of her former admirer retained only enough memory to
   dictate the naming of her only son, and the moral guidance of that
   handsome and headstrong youth. Now, in spite of all that guidance,
   Alfred Trever was at Sheehan's and about to take his first drink.

   "Boss," cried Schultz, as he entered the vile-smelling room with his
   young victim, "meet my friend Al Trever, bes' li'1' sport up at
   Lawrence -- thas"n Appleton, Wis., y' know. Some swell guy, too -- 's
   father's a big corp'ration lawyer up in his burg, 'n' 's mother's some
   fiery genius. He wants to see life as she is -- wants to know what the
   real lightnin' juice tastes like -- so jus'remember he's me friend an'
   treat 'im right."

   As the names Trever, Lawrence, and Appleton fell on the air, the
   loafers seemed to sense something unusual. Perhaps it was only some
   sound connected with the clicking balls of the pool tables or the
   rattling glasses that were brought from the cryptic regions in the rear
   -- perhaps only that, plus some strange rustling of the dirty draperies
   at the one dingy window-but many thought that someone in the room had
   gritted his teeth and drawn a very sharp breath.

   "Glad to know you, Sheehan," said Trever in a quiet, well-bred tone.

   "This is my first experience in a place like this, but I am a student
   of life, and don't want to miss any experience. There's poetry in this
   sort of thing, you know -- or perhaps you don't know, but it's all the
   same.

   "Young feller," responded the proprietor, "ya come tuh th' right place
   tuh see life. We got all kinds here -- reel life an' a good time. The
   damn' government can try tuh make folks good of it wants tuh, but it
   can't stop a feller from hittin"er up when he feels like it. Whaddya
   want, feller -- booze, coke, or some other sorta dope? Yuh can't ask
   for nothin' we ain't got."

   Habitués say that it was at this point they noticed a cessation in the
   regular, monotonous strokes of the mop.

   "I want whiskey -- good old-fashioned rye!" exclaimed Trever
   enthusiastically. "I'll tell you, I'm good and tired of water after
   reading of the merry bouts fellows used to have in the old days. I
   can't read an Anacreontic without watering at the mouth -- and it's
   something a lot stronger than water that my mouth waters for!"

   "Anacreontic -- what'n hell's that?" several hangers-on looked up as
   the young man went slightly beyond their depth. But the bank defaulter
   under cover explained to them that Anacreon was a gay old dog who lived
   many years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was
   just like Sheehan's.

   "Let me see, Trever," continued the defaulter, "didn't Schultz say your
   mother is a literary person, too?"

   "Yes, damn it," replied Trever, "but nothing like the old Teian! She's
   one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out
   of life. Namby-pamby sort -- ever heard of her? She writes under her
   maiden name of Eleanor Wing."

   Here it was that Old Bugs dropped his mop.

   "Well, here's yer stuff," announced Sheehan jovially as a tray of
   bottles and glasses was wheeled into the room. "Good old rye, an' as
   fiery as ya kin find anyw'eres in Chi."

   The youth's eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the
   brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him. It repelled
   him horribly, and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his
   determination to taste life to the full remained with him, and he
   maintained a bold front. But before his resolution was put to the test,
   the unexpected intervened. Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching
   position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed
   from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the
   tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents
   upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles
   and tumblers. Numbers of men, or things which had been men, dropped to
   the floor and began lapping at the puddles of spilled liquor, but most
   remained immovable, watching the unprecedented actions of the barroom
   drudge and derelict. Old Bugs straightened up before the astonished
   Trever, and in a mild and cultivated voice said, "Do not do this thing.
   I was like you once, and I did it. Now I am like -- this."

   "What do you mean, you damned old fool?" shouted Trever. "What do you
   mean by interfering with a gentleman in his pleasures?" Sheehan, now
   recovering from his astonishment, advanced and laid a heavy hand on the
   old waif's shoulder.

   "This is the last time far you, old bird!" he exclaimed furiously.
   "When a gen'l'man wants tuh take a drink here, by God, he shall,
   without you interferin'. Now get th' hell outa here afore I kick hell
   outa ya."

   But Sheehan had reckoned without scientific knowledge of abnormal
   psychology and the effects of nervous stimulus. Old Bugs, obtaining a
   firmer hold on his mop, began to wield it like the javelin of a
   Macedonian hoplite, and soon cleared a considerable space around
   himself, meanwhile shouting various disconnected bits of quotation,
   among which was prominently repeated, " . . . the sons of Belial, blown
   with insolence and wine."

   The room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at
   the sinister being they had aroused. Trever seemed dazed in the
   confusion, and shrank to the wall as the strife thickened. "He shall
   not drink! He shall not drink!" Thus roared Old Bugs as he seemed to
   run out of -- or rise above -- quotations. Policemen appeared at the
   door, attracted by the noise, but for a time they made no move to
   intervene. Trever, now thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his
   desire to see life via the vice route, edged closer to the blue-coated
   newcomers. Could he but escape and catch a train for Appleton, he
   reflected, he would consider his education in dissipation quite
   complete.

   Then suddenly Old Bugs ceased to wield his javelin and stopped still --
   drawing himself up more erectly than any denizen of the place had ever
   seen him before. "Ave, Caesar, moriturus te saluto!" he shouted, and
   dropped to the whiskey-reeking floor, never to rise again.

   Subsequent impressions will never leave the mind of young Trever. The
   picture is blurred, but ineradicable. Policemen ploughed a way through
   the crowd, questioning everyone closely both about the incident and
   about the dead figure on the floor. Sheehan especially did they ply
   with inquiries, yet without eliciting any information of value
   concerning Old Bugs. Then the bank defaulter remembered the picture,
   and suggested that it be viewed and filed for identification at police
   headquarters. An officer bent reluctantly over the loathsome glassyeyed
   form and found the tissue-wrapped cardboard, which he passed around
   among the others.

   "Some chicken!" leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face,
   but those who were sober did not leer, looking with respect and
   abashment at the delicate and spiritual features. No one seemed able to
   place the subject, and all wondered that the drugdegraded derelict
   should have such a portrait in his possession -- that is, all but the
   bank defaulter, who was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather
   uneasily. He had seen a little deeper beneath Old Bugs' mask of utter
   degradation.

   Then the picture was passed to Trever, and a change came over the
   youth. After the first start, he replaced the tissue wrapping around
   the portrait, as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place. Then
   he gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor, noting its
   great height, and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to
   appear now that the wretched flame of life had flickered out. No, he
   said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the
   subject of the picture. It was so old, he added, that no one now could
   be expected to recognise it.

   But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he
   offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in
   Appleton. Over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of
   that picture, and all his life he had known and loved its original.

   For the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother.

   The hours of night unheeded fly,
   And in the grate the embers fade;
   Vast shadows one by one pass by
   In silent daemon cavalcade.
   But still the magic volume holds
   The raptur'd eye in realms apart,
   And fulgent sorcery enfolds
   The willing mind and eager heart.
   The lonely room no more is there -
   For to the sight in pomp appear
   Temples and cities pois'd in air
   And blazing glories - sphere on sphere.

   On Recieving a Picture of Swans

   With pensive grace, the melancholy Swan
   Mourns o'er the tomb of luckless Phaethon;
   On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave,
   And guard with tender card the wat'ry grave.
   Would that I might, should I too proudly claim
   An Heav'nly parent, or a God-like fame;
   When flown too high, and dash'd to depths below,
   Receive such tribute as a Cygnus' woe!
   The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along,
   Sighs all the deeper for his want of song.

   When, long ago, the gods created Earth
   In Jove's fair image Man was shaped at birth.
   The beasts for lesser parts were next designed;
   Yet were they too remote from humankind.
   To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man,
   Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan.
   A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,
   Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.

   (Ms. found among the effects of the late Richard H. Johnson, Ph.D.,
   curator of the Cabot Museum of Archaeology, Boston, Mass.)

I[edit]

   It is not likely that anyone in Boston - or any alert reader elsewhere
   - will ever forget the strange affair of the Cabot Museum. The
   newspaper publicity given to that hellish mummy, the antique and
   terrible rumours vaguely linked with it, the morbid wave of interest
   and cult activities during 1932, and the frightful fate of the two
   intruders on December 1st of that year, all combined to form one of
   those classic mysteries which go down for generations as folklore and
   become the nuclei of whole cycles of horrific speculation.

   Everyone seems to realise, too, that something very vital and
   unutterably hideous was suppressed in the public accounts of the
   culminant horrors. Those first disquieting hints as to the condition of
   one of the two bodies were dismissed and ignored too abruptly - nor
   were the singular modifications in the mummy given the following-up
   which their news value would normally prompt. It also struck people as
   queer that the mummy was never restored to its case. In these days of
   expert taxidermy the excuse that its disintegrating condition made
   exhibition impracticable seemed a peculiarly lame one.

   As curator of the museum I am in a position to reveal all the
   suppressed facts, but this I shall not do during my lifetime. There are
   things about the world and universe which it is better for the majority
   not to know, and I have not departed from the opinion in which all of
   us - museum staff, physicians, reporters, and police - concurred at the
   period of the horror itself. At the same time it seems proper that a
   matter of such overwhelming scientific and historic importance should
   not remain wholly unrecorded - hence this account which I have prepared
   for the benefit of serious students. I shall place it among various
   papers to be examined after my death, leaving its fate to the
   discretion of my executors. Certain threats and unusual events during
   the past weeks have led me to believe that my life - as well as that of
   other museum officials - is in some peril through the enmity of several
   widespread secret cults of Asiatics, Polynesians, and heterogeneous
   mystical devotees; hence it is possible that the work of the executors
   may not be long postponed. [Executor's note: Dr. Johnson died suddenly
   and rather mysteriously of heart-failure on April 22, 1933. Wentworth
   Moore, taxidermist of the museum, disappeared around the middle of the
   preceding month. On February 18 of the same year Dr. William Minot, who
   superintended a dissection connected with the case, was stabbed in the
   back, dying the following day.]

   The real beginning of the horror, I suppose, was in 1879 - long before
   my term as curator - when the museum acquired that ghastly,
   inexplicable mummy from the Orient Shipping Company. Its very discovery
   was monstrous and menacing, for it came from a crypt of unknown origin
   and fabulous antiquity on a bit of land suddenly upheaved from the
   Pacific's floor.

   On May 11, 1878, Capt. Charles Weatherbee of the freighter Eridanus,
   bound from Wellington, New Zealand, to Valparaiso, Chile, had sighted a
   new island unmarked on any chart and evidently of volcanic origin. It
   projected quite boldly out of the sea in the form of a truncated cone.
   A landing-party under Capt. Weatherbee noted evidences of long
   submersion on the rugged slopes which they climbed, while at the summit
   there were signs of recent destruction, as by an earthquake. Among the
   scattered rubble were massive stones of manifestly artificial shaping,
   and a little examination disclosed the presence of some of that
   prehistoric Cyclopean masonry found on certain Pacific islands and
   forming a perpetual archaeological puzzle.

   Finally the sailors entered a massive stone crypt - judged to have been
   part of a much larger edifice, and to have originally lain far
   underground - in one corner of which the frightful mummy crouched.
   After a short period of virtual panic, caused partly by certain
   carvings on the walls, the men were induced to move the mummy to the
   ship, though it was only with fear and loathing that they touched it.
   Close to the body, as if once thrust into its clothes, was a cylinder
   of an unknown metal containing a roll of thin, bluishwhite membrane of
   equally unknown nature, inscribed with peculiar characters in a
   greyish, indeterminable pigment. In the centre of the vast stone floor
   was a suggestion of a trap-door, but the party lacked apparatus
   sufficiently powerful to move it.

   The Cabot Museum, then newly established, saw the meagre reports of the
   discovery and at once took steps to acquire the mummy and the cylinder.
   Curator Pickman made a personal trip to Valparaiso and outfitted a
   schooner to search for the crypt where the thing had been found, though
   meeting with failure in this matter. At the recorded position of the
   island nothing but the sea's unbroken expanse could be discerned, and
   the seekers realised that the same seismic forces which had suddenly
   thrust the island up had carried it down again to the watery darkness
   where it had brooded for untold aeons. The secret of that immovable
   trap-door would never be solved. The mummy and the cylinder, however,
   remained - and the former was placed on exhibition early in November,
   1879, in the museum's hall of mummies.

   The Cabot Museum of Archaeology, which specialises in such remnants of
   ancient and unknown civilisations as do not fall within the domain of
   art, is a small and scarcely famous institution, though one of high
   standing in scientific circles. It stands in the heart of Boston's
   exclusive Beacon Hill district - in Mt. Vernon Street, near Joy -
   housed in a former private mansion with an added wing in the rear, and
   was a source of pride to its austere neighbours until the recent
   terrible events brought it an undesirable notoriety. The hall of
   mummies on the western side of the original mansion (which was designed
   by Bulfinch and erected in 1819), on the second floor, is justly
   esteemed by historians and anthropologists as harbouring the greatest
   collection of its kind in America. Here may be found typical examples
   of Egyptian embalming from the earliest Sakkarah specimens to the last
   Coptic attempts of the eighth century; mummies of other cultures,
   including the prehistoric Indian specimens recently found in the
   Aleutian Islands; agonised Pompeian figures moulded in plaster from
   tragic hollows in the ruin choking ashes; naturally mummified bodies
   from mines and other excavations in all parts of the earth - some
   surprised by their terrible entombment in the grotesque postures caused
   by their last, tearing death-throes - everything, in short, which any
   collection of the sort could well be expected to contain. In 1879, of
   course, it was much less ample than it is now; yet even then it was
   remarkable. But that shocking thing from the primal Cyclopean crypt on
   an ephemeral sea-spawned island was always its chief attraction and
   most impenetrable mystery.

   The mummy was that of a medium-sized man of unknown race, and was cast
   in a peculiar crouching posture. The face, half shielded by claw-like
   hands, had its under jaw thrust far forward, while the shrivelled
   features bore an expression of fright so hideous that few spectators
   could view them unmoved. The eyes were closed, with lids clamped down
   tightly over eyeballs apparently bulging and prominent. Bits of hair
   and beard remained, and the colour of the whole was a sort of dull
   neutral grey. In texture the thing was half leathery and half stony,
   forming an insoluble enigma to those experts who sought to ascertain
   how it was embalmed. In places bits of its substance were eaten away by
   time and decay. Rags of some peculiar fabric, with suggestions of
   unknown designs, still clung to the object.

   Just what made it so infinitely horrible and repulsive one could hardly
   say. For one thing, there was a subtle, indefinable sense of limitless
   antiquity and utter alienage which affected one like a view from the
   brink of a monstrous abyss of unplumbed blackness - but mostly it was
   the expression of crazed fear on the puckered, prognathous,
   half-shielded face. Such a symbol of infinite, inhuman, cosmic fright
   could not help communicating the emotion to the beholder amidst a
   disquieting cloud of mystery and vain conjecture.

   Among the discriminating few who frequented the Cabot Museum this relic
   of an elder, forgotten world soon acquired an unholy fame, though the
   institution's seclusion and quiet policy prevented it from becoming a
   popular sensation of the "Cardiff Giant" sort. In the last century the
   art of vulgar ballyhoo had not invaded the field of scholarship to the
   extent it has now succeeded in doing. Naturally, savants of various
   kinds tried their best to classify the frightful object, though always
   without success. Theories of a bygone Pacific civilisation, of which
   the Easter Island images and the megalithic masonry of Ponape and
   Nan-Matol are conceivable vestiges, were freely circulated among
   students, and learned journals carried varied and often conflicting
   speculations on a possible former continent whose peaks survive as the
   myriad islands of Melanesia and Polynesia. The diversity in dates
   assigned to the hypothetical vanished culture - or continent - was at
   once bewildering and amusing; yet some surprisingly relevant allusions
   were found in certain myths of Tahiti and other islands.

   Meanwhile the strange cylinder and its baffling scroll of unknown
   hieroglyphs, carefully preserved in the museum library, received their
   due share of attention. No question could exist as to their association
   with the mummy; hence all realised that in the unravelling of their
   mystery the mystery of the shrivelled horror would in all probability
   be unravelled as well. The cylinder, about four inches long by
   seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, was of a queerly iridescent metal
   utterly defying chemical analysis and seemingly impervious to all
   reagents. It was tightly fitted with a cap of the same substance, and
   bore engraved figurings of an evidently decorative and possibly
   symbolic nature - conventional designs which seemed to follow a
   peculiarly alien, paradoxical, and doubtfully describable system of
   geometry.

   Not less mysterious was the scroll it contained - a neat roll of some
   thin, bluish-white, unanalysable membrane, coiled round a slim rod of
   metal like that of the cylinder, and unwinding to a length of some two
   feet. The large, bold hieroglyphs, extending in a narrow line down the
   centre of the scroll and penned or painted with a grey pigment defying
   analysts, resembled nothing known to linguists and palaeographers, and
   could not be deciphered despite the transmission of photographic copies
   to every living expert in the given field.

   It is true that a few scholars, unusually versed in the literature of
   occultism and magic, found vague resemblances between some of the
   hieroglyphs and certain primal symbols described or cited in two or
   three very ancient, obscure, and esoteric texts such as the Book of
   Eibon, reputed to descend from forgotten Hyperborea; the Pnakotic
   fragments, alleged to be pre-human; and the monstrous and forbidden
   Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. None of these
   resemblances, however, was beyond dispute; and because of the
   prevailing low estimation of occult studies, no effort was made to
   circulate copies of the hieroglyphs among mystical specialists. Had
   such circulation occurred at this early date, the later history of the
   case might have been very different; indeed, a glance at the
   hieroglyphs by any reader of von Junzt's horrible Nameless Cults would
   have established a linkage of unmistakable significance. At this
   period, however, the readers of that monstrous blasphemy were
   exceedingly few; copies having been incredibly scarce in the interval
   between the suppression of the original Dusseldorf edition (1839) and
   of the Bridewell translation (1845) and the publication of the
   expurgated reprint by the Golden Goblin Press in 1909. Practically
   speaking, no occultist or student of the primal past's esoteric lore
   had his attention called to the strange scroll until the recent
   outburst of sensational journalism which precipitated the horrible
   climax.

II[edit]

   Thus matters glided along for a half-century following the installation
   of the frightful mummy at the museum. The gruesome object had a local
   celebrity among cultivated Bostonians, but no more than that; while the
   very existence of the cylinder and scroll - after a decade of futile
   research - was virtually forgotten. So quiet and conservative was the
   Cabot Museum that no reporter or feature writer ever thought of
   invading its uneventful precincts for rabble-tickling material.

   The invasion of ballyhoo commenced in the spring of 1931, when a
   purchase of somewhat spectacular nature - that of the strange objects
   and inexplicably preserved bodies found in crypts beneath the almost
   vanished and evilly famous ruins of Chateau Faussesflammes, in
   Averoigne, France - brought the museum prominently into the news
   columns. True to its "hustling" policy, the Boston Pillar sent a Sunday
   feature writer to cover the incident and pad it with an exaggerated
   general account of the institution itself; and this young man - Stuart
   Reynolds by name - hit upon the nameless mummy as a potential sensation
   far surpassing the recent acquisitions nominally forming his chief
   assignment. A smattering of theosophical lore, and a fondness for the
   speculations of such writers as Colonel Churchward and Lewis Spence
   concerning lost continents and primal forgotten civilisations, made
   Reynolds especially alert toward any aeonian relic like the unknown
   mummy.

   At the museum the reporter made himself a nuisance through constant and
   not always intelligent questionings and endless demands for the
   movement of encased objects to permit photographs from unusual angles.
   In the basement library room he pored endlessly over the strange metal
   cylinder and its membraneous scroll, photographing them from every
   angle and securing pictures of every bit of the weird hieroglyphed
   text. He likewise asked to see all books with any bearing whatever on
   the subject of primal cultures and sunken continents - sitting for
   three hours taking notes, and leaving only in order to hasten to
   Cambridge for a sight (if permission were granted) of the abhorred and
   forbidden Necronomicon at the Widener Library.

   On April 5th the article appeared in the Sunday Pillar, smothered in
   photographs of mummy, cylinder, and hieroglyphed scroll, and couched in
   the peculiarly simpering, infantile style which the Pillar affects for
   the benefit of its vast and mentally immature clientele. Full of
   inaccuracies, exaggerations, and sensationalism, it was precisely the
   sort of thing to stir the brainless and fickle interest of the herd -
   and as a result the once quiet museum began to be swarmed with
   chattering and vacuously staring throngs such as its stately corridors
   had never known before.

   There were scholarly and intelligent visitors, too, despite the
   puerility of the article - the pictures had spoken for themselves - and
   many persons of mature attainments sometimes see the Pillar by
   accident. I recall one very strange character who appeared during
   November - a dark, turbaned, and bushily bearded man with a laboured,
   unnatural voice, curiously expressionless face, clumsy hands covered
   with absurd white mittens, who gave a squalid West End address and
   called himself "Swami Chandraputra". This fellow was unbelievably
   erudite in occult lore and seemed profoundly and solemnly moved by the
   resemblance of the hieroglyphs on the scroll to certain signs and
   symbols of a forgotten elder world about which he professed vast
   intuitive knowledge.

   By June, the fame of the mummy and scroll had leaked far beyond Boston,
   and the museum had inquiries and requests for photographs from
   occultists and students of arcana all over the world. This was not
   altogether pleasing to our staff, since we are a scientific institution
   without sympathy for fantastic dreamers; yet we answered all questions
   with civility. One result of these catechisms was a highly learned
   article in The Occult Review by the famous New Orleans mystic
   Etienne-Laurent de Marigny, in which was asserted the complete identity
   of some of the odd geometrical designs on the iridescent cylinder, and
   of several of the hieroglyphs on the membraneous scroll, with certain
   ideographs of horrible significance (transcribed from primal monoliths
   or from the secret rituals of hidden bands of esoteric students and
   devotees) reproduced in the hellish and suppressed Black Book or
   Nameless Cults of von Junzt.

   De Marigny recalled the frightful death of von Junzt in 1840, a year
   after the publication of his terrible volume at Dusseldorf, and
   commented on his blood-curdling and partly suspected sources of
   information. Above all, he emphasised the enormous relevance of the
   tales with which von Junzt linked most of the monstrous ideographs he
   had reproduced. That these tales, in which a cylinder and scroll were
   expressly mentioned, held a remarkable suggestion of relationship to
   the things at the museum, no one could deny; yet they were of such
   breath-taking extravagance - involving such unbelievable sweeps of time
   and such fantastic anomalies of a forgotten elder world - that one
   could much more easily admire than believe them.

   Admire them the public certainly did, for copying in the press was
   universal. Illustrated articles sprang up everywhere, telling or
   purporting to tell the legends in the Black Book, expatiating on the
   horror of the mummy, comparing the cylinder's designs and the scroll's
   hieroglyphs with the figures reproduced by von Junzt, and indulging in
   the wildest, most sensational, and most irrational theories and
   speculations. Attendance at the museum was trebled, and the widespread
   nature of the interest was attested by the plethora of mail on the
   subject - most of it inane and superfluous - received at the museum.
   Apparently the mummy and its origin formed - for imaginative people - a
   close rival to the depression as chief topic of 1931 and 1932. For my
   own part, the principal effect of the furore was to make me read von
   Junzt's monstrous volume in the Golden Goblin edition - a perusal which
   left me dizzy and nauseated, yet thankful that I had not seen the utter
   infamy of the unexpurgated text.

III[edit]

   The archaic whispers reflected in the Black Book, and linked with
   designs and symbols so closely akin to what the mysterious scroll and
   cylinder bore, were indeed of a character to hold one spellbound and
   not a little awestruck. Leaping an incredible gulf of time - behind all
   the civilisations, races, and lands we know - they clustered round a
   vanished nation and a vanished continent of the misty, fabulous
   dawn-years . . . that to which legend has given the name of Mu, and
   which old tablets in the primal Naacal tongue speak of as flourishing
   200,000 years ago, when Europe harboured only hybrid entities, and lost
   Hyperborea knew the nameless worship of black amorphous Tsathoggua.

   There was mention of a kingdom or province called K'naa in a very
   ancient land where the first human people had found monstrous ruins
   left by those who had dwelt there before - vague waves of unknown
   entities which had filtered down from the stars and lived out their
   aeons on a forgotten, nascent world. K'naa was a sacred place, since
   from its midst the bleak basalt cliffs of Mount Yaddith-Gho soared
   starkly into the sky, topped by a gigantic fortress of Cyclopean stone,
   infinitely older than mankind and built by the alien spawn of the dark
   planet Yuggoth, which had colonised the earth before the birth of
   terrestrial life.

   The spawn of Yuggoth had perished aeons before, but had left behind
   them one monstrous and terrible living thing which could never die -
   their hellish god or patron daemon Ghatanothoa, which glowered and
   brooded eternally though unseen in the crypts beneath that fortress on
   Yaddith-Gho. No human creature had ever climbed Yaddith-Gho or seen
   that blasphemous fortress except as a distant and geometrically
   abnormal outline against the sky; yet most agreed that Ghatanothoa was
   still there, wallowing and burrowing in unsuspected abysses beneath the
   megalithic walls. There were always those who believed that sacrifices
   must be made to Ghatanothoa, lest it crawl out of its hidden abysses
   and waddle horribly through the world of men as it had once waddled
   through the primal world of the Yuggoth-spawn.

   People said that if no victims were offered, Ghatanothoa would ooze up
   to the light of day and lumber down the basalt cliffs of Yaddith-Gho
   bringing doom to all it might encounter. For no living thing could
   behold Ghatanothoa, or even a perfect graven image of Ghatanothoa,
   however small, without suffering a change more horrible than death
   itself. Sight of the god, or its image, as all the legends of the
   Yuggothspawn agreed, meant paralysis and petrifaction of a singularly
   shocking sort, in which the victim was turned to stone and leather on
   the outside, while the brain within remained perpetually alive -
   horribly fixed and prisoned through the ages, and maddeningly conscious
   of the passage of interminable epochs of helpless inaction till chance
   and time might complete the decay of the petrified shell and leave it
   exposed to die. Most brains, of course, would go mad long before this
   aeon-deferred release could arrive. No human eyes, it was said, had
   ever glimpsed Ghatanothoa, though the danger was as great now as it had
   been for the Yuggoth-spawn.

   And so there was a cult in K'naa which worshipped Ghatanothoa and each
   year sacrificed to it twelve young warriors and twelve young maidens.
   These victims were offered up on flaming altars in the marble temple
   near the mountain's base, for none dared climb Yaddith-Gho's basalt
   cliffs or draw near to the Cyclopean prehuman stronghold on its crest.
   Vast was the power of the priests of Ghatanothoa, since upon them alone
   depended the preservation of K'naa and of all the land of Mu from the
   petrifying emergence of Ghatanothoa out of its unknown burrows.

   There were in the land an hundred priests of the Dark God, under
   Imash-Mo the High-Priest, who walked before King Thabon at the
   Nath-feast, and stood proudly whilst the King knelt at the Dhoric
   shrine. Each priest had a marble house, a chest of gold, two hundred
   slaves, and an hundred concubines, besides immunity from civil law and
   the power of life and death over all in K'naa save the priests of the
   King. Yet in spite of these defenders there was ever a fear in the land
   lest Ghatanothoa slither up from the depths and lurch viciously down
   the mountain to bring horror and petrification to mankind. In the
   latter years the priests forbade men even to guess or imagine what its
   frightful aspect might be.

   It was in the Year of the Red Moon (estimated as B.C. 173,148 by von
   Junzt) that a human being first dared to breathe defiance against
   Ghatanothoa and its nameless menace. This bold heretic was T'yog,
   High-Priest of Shub-Niggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the
   Goat with a Thousand Young. T'yog had thought long on the powers of the
   various gods, and had had strange dreams and revelations touching the
   life of this and earlier worlds. In the end he felt sure that the gods
   friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, and believed
   that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, were
   ready to take sides with man against the tyranny and presumption of
   Ghatanothoa.

   Inspired by the Mother Goddess, T'yog wrote down a strange formula in
   the hieratic Naacal of his order, which he believed would keep the
   possessor immune from the Dark God's petrifying power. With this
   protection, he reflected, it might be possible for a bold man to climb
   the dreaded basalt cliffs and - first of all human beings - enter the
   Cyclopean fortress beneath which Ghatanothoa reputedly brooded. Face to
   face with the god, and with the power of Shub-Niggurath and her sons on
   his side, T'yog believed that he might be able to bring it to terms and
   at last deliver mankind from its brooding menace. With humanity freed
   through his efforts, there would be no limits to the honours he might
   claim. All the honours of the priests of Ghatanothoa would perforce be
   transferred to him; and even kingship or godhood might conceivably be
   within his reach.

   So T'yog wrote his protective formula on a scroll of pthagon membrane
   (according to von Junzt, the inner skin of the extinct ya-kith-lizard)
   and enclosed it in a carven cylinder of lagh metal - the metal brought
   by the Elder Ones from Yuggoth, and found in no mine of earth. This
   charm, carried in his robe, would make him proof against the menace of
   Ghatanothoa - it would even restore the Dark God's petrified victims if
   that monstrous entity should ever emerge and begin its devastations.
   Thus he proposed to go up the shunned and man-untrodden mountain,
   invade the alien-angled citadel of Cyclopean stone, and confront the
   shocking devil-entity in its lair. Of what would follow, he could not
   even guess; but the hope of being mankind's saviour lent strength to
   his will.

   He had, however, reckoned without the jealousy and self-interest of
   Ghatanothoa's pampered priests. No sooner did they hear of his plan
   than - fearful for their prestige and privilege in case the Daemon-God
   should be dethroned - they set up a frantic clamour against the
   so-called sacrilege, crying that no man might prevail against
   Ghatanothoa, and that any effort to seek it out would merely provoke it
   to a hellish onslaught against mankind which no spell or priestcraft
   could hope to avert. With those cries they hoped to turn the public
   mind against T'yog; yet such was the people's yearning for freedom from
   Ghatanothoa, and such their confidence in the skill and zeal of T'yog,
   that all the protestations came to naught. Even the King, usually a
   puppet of the priests, refused to forbid T'yog's daring pilgrimage.

   It was then that the priests of Ghatanothoa did by stealth what they
   could not do openly. One night Imash- Mo, the High-Priest, stole to
   T'yog in his temple chamber and took from his sleeping form the metal
   cylinder; silently drawing out the potent scroll and putting in its
   place another scroll of great similitude, yet varied enough to have no
   power against any god or daemon. When the cylinder was slipped back
   into the sleeper's cloak Imash-Mo was content, for he knew T'yog was
   little likely to study that cylinder's contents again. Thinking himself
   protected by the true scroll, the heretic would march up the forbidden
   mountain and into the Evil Presence - and Ghatanothoa, unchecked by any
   magic, would take care of the rest.

   It would no longer be needful for Ghatanothoa's priests to preach
   against the defiance. Let T'yog go his way and meet his doom. And
   secretly, the priests would always cherish the stolen scroll - the true
   and potent charm - handing it down from one High-Priest to another for
   use in any dim future when it might be needful to contravene the
   Devil-God's will. So the rest of the night Imash-Mo slept in great
   peace, with the true scroll in a new cylinder fashioned for its
   harbourage.

   It was dawn on the Day of the Sky-Flames (nomenclature undefined by von
   Junzt) that T'yog, amidst the prayers and chanting of the people and
   with King Thabon's blessing on his head, started up the dreaded
   mountain with a staff of tlath-wood in his right hand. Within his robe
   was the cylinder holding what he thought to be the true charm - for he
   had indeed failed to find out the imposture. Nor did he see any irony
   in the prayers which Imash-Mo and the other priests of Ghatanothoa
   intoned for his safety and success.

   All that morning the people stood and watched as T'yog's dwindling form
   struggled up the shunned basalt slope hitherto alien to men's
   footsteps, and many stayed watching long after he had vanished where a
   perilous ledge led round to the mountain's hidden side. That night a
   few sensitive dreamers thought they heard a faint tremor convulsing the
   hated peak; though most ridiculed them for the statement. Next day vast
   crowds watched the mountain and prayed, and wondered how soon T'yog
   would return. And so the next day, and the next. For weeks they hoped
   and waited, and then they wept. Nor did anyone ever see T'yog, who
   would have saved mankind from fears, again.

   Thereafter men shuddered at T'yog's presumption, and tried not to think
   of the punishment his impiety had met. And the priests of Ghatanothoa
   smiled to those who might resent the god's will or challenge its right
   to the sacrifices. In later years the ruse of Imash-Mo became known to
   the people; yet the knowledge availed not to change the general feeling
   that Ghatanothoa were better left alone. None ever dared to defy it
   again. And so the ages rolled on, and King succeeded King, and
   High-Priest succeeded High-Priest, and nations rose and decayed, and
   lands rose above the sea and returned into the sea. And with many
   millennia decay fell upon K'naa - till at last on a hideous day of
   storm and thunder, terrific rumbling, and mountain-high waves, all the
   land of Mu sank into the sea forever.

   Yet down the later aeons thin streams of ancient secrets trickled. In
   distant lands there met together greyfaced fugitives who had survived
   the sea-fiend's rage, and strange skies drank the smoke of altars
   reared to vanished gods and daemons. Though none knew to what
   bottomless deep the sacred peak and Cyclopean fortress of dreaded
   Ghatanothoa had sunk, there were still those who mumbled its name and
   offered to it nameless sacrifices lest it bubble up through leagues of
   ocean and shamble among men spreading horror and petrifaction.

   Around the scattered priests grew the rudiments of a dark and secret
   cult - secret because the people of the new lands had other gods and
   devils, and thought only evil of elder and alien ones - and within that
   cult many hideous things were done, and many strange objects cherished.
   It was whispered that a certain line of elusive priests still harboured
   the true charm against Ghatanothoa which Imash-Mo stole from the
   sleeping T'yog; though none remained who could read or understand the
   cryptic syllables, or who could even guess in what part of the world
   the lost K'naa, the dreaded peak of Yaddith-Gho, and the titan fortress
   of the Devil-God had lain.

   Though it flourished chiefly in those Pacific regions around which Mu
   itself had once stretched, there were rumours of the hidden and
   detested cult of Ghatanothoa in ill-fated Atlantis, and on the abhorred
   plateau of Leng. Von Junzt implied its presence in the fabled
   subterrene kingdom of K'n-yan, and gave clear evidence that it had
   penetrated Egypt, Chaldaea, Persia, China, the forgotten Semite empires
   of Africa, and Mexico and Peru in the New World. That it had a strong
   connexion with the witchcraft movement in Europe, against which the
   bulls of popes were vainly directed, he more than strongly hinted. The
   West, however, was never favourable to its growth; and public
   indignation - aroused by glimpses of hideous rites and nameless
   sacrifices - wholly stamped out many of its branches. In the end it
   became a hunted, doubly furtive underground affair - yet never could
   its nucleus be quite exterminated. It always survived somehow, chiefly
   in the Far East and on the Pacific Islands, where its teachings became
   merged into the esoteric lore of the Polynesian Areoi.

   Von Junzt gave subtle and disquieting hints of actual contact with the
   cult; so that as I read I shuddered at what was rumoured about his
   death. He spoke of the growth of certain ideas regarding the appearance
   of the Devil-God - a creature which no human being (unless it were the
   too-daring T'yog, who had never returned) had ever seen - and
   contrasted this habit of speculation with the taboo prevailing in
   ancient Mu against any attempt to imagine what the horror looked like.
   There was a peculiar fearfulness about the devotees' awed and
   fascinated whispers on this subject - whispers heavy with morbid
   curiosity concerning the precise nature of what T'yog might have
   confronted in that frightful pre-human edifice on the dreaded and
   now-sunken mountains before the end (if it was an end) finally came -
   and I felt oddly disturbed by the German scholar's oblique and
   insidious references to this topic.

   Scarcely less disturbing were von Junzt's conjectures on the
   whereabouts of the stolen scroll of cantrips against Ghatanothoa, and
   on the ultimate uses to which this scroll might be put. Despite all my
   assurance that the whole matter was purely mythical, I could not help
   shivering at the notion of a latter-day emergence of the monstrous god,
   and at the picture of an humanity turned suddenly to a race of abnormal
   statues, each encasing a living brain doomed to inert and helpless
   consciousness for untold aeons of futurity. The old Dusseldorf savant
   had a poisonous way of suggesting more than he stated, and I could
   understand why his damnable book was suppressed in so many countries as
   blasphemous, dangerous, and unclean.

   I writhed with repulsion, yet the thing exerted an unholy fascination;
   and I could not lay it down till I had finished it. The alleged
   reproductions of designs and ideographs from Mu were marvellously and
   startlingly like the markings on the strange cylinder and the
   characters on the scroll, and the whole account teemed with details
   having vague, irritating suggestions of resemblance to things connected
   with the hideous mummy. The cylinder and scroll - the Pacific setting -
   the persistent notion of old Capt. Weatherbee that the Cyclopean crypt
   where the mummy was found had once lain under a vast building . . .
   somehow I was vaguely glad that the volcanic island had sunk before
   that massive suggestion of a trapdoor could be opened.

IV[edit]

   What I read in the Black Book formed a fiendishly apt preparation for
   the news items and closer events which began to force themselves upon
   me in the spring of 1932. I can scarcely recall just when the
   increasingly frequent reports of police action against the odd and
   fantastical religious cults in the Orient and elsewhere commenced to
   impress me; but by May or June I realised that there was, all over the
   world, a surprising and unwonted burst of activity on the part of
   bizarre, furtive, and esoteric mystical organisations ordinarily
   quiescent and seldom heard from.

   It is not likely that I would have connected these reports with either
   the hints of von Junzt or the popular furore over the mummy and
   cylinder in the museum, but for certain significant syllables and
   persistent resemblances - sensationally dwelt upon by the press - in
   the rites and speeches of the various secret celebrants brought to
   public attention. As it was, I could not help remarking with disquiet
   the frequent recurrence of a name - in various corrupt forms - which
   seemed to constitute a focal point of all the cult worship, and which
   was obviously regarded with a singular mixture of reverence and terror.
   Some of the forms quoted were G'tanta, Tanotah, Than-Tha, Gatan, and
   Ktan-Tah - and it did not require the suggestions of my now numerous
   occultist correspondents to make me see in these variants a hideous and
   suggestive kinship to the monstrous name rendered by von Junzt as
   Ghatanothoa.

   There were other disquieting features, too. Again and again the reports
   cited vague, awestruck references to a "true scroll" - something on
   which tremendous consequences seemed to hinge, and which was mentioned
   as being in the custody of a certain "Nagob", whoever and whatever he
   might be. Likewise, there was an insistent repetition of a name which
   sounded like Tog, Tiok, Yog, Zob, or Yob, and which my more and more
   excited consciousness involuntarily linked with the name of the hapless
   heretic T'yog as given in the Black Book. This name was usually uttered
   in connexion with such cryptical phrases as "It is none other than he",
   "He had looked upon its face", "He knows all, though he can neither see
   nor feel", "He has brought the memory down through the aeons", "The
   true scroll will release him", "Nagob has the true scroll", "He can
   tell where to find it".

   Something very queer was undoubtedly in the air, and I did not wonder
   when my occultist correspondents, as well as the sensational Sunday
   papers, began to connect the new abnormal stirrings with the legends of
   Mu on the one hand, and with the frightful mummy's recent exploitation
   on the other hand. The widespread articles in the first wave of press
   publicity, with their insistent linkage of the mummy, cylinder, and
   scroll with the tale in the Black Book, and their crazily fantastic
   speculations about the whole matter, might very well have roused the
   latent fanaticism in hundreds of those furtive groups of exotic
   devotees with which our complex world abounds. Nor did the papers cease
   adding fuel to the flames - for the stories on the cult-stirrings were
   even wilder than the earlier series of yarns.

   As the summer drew on, attendants noticed a curious new element among
   the throngs of visitors which - after a lull following the first burst
   of publicity - were again drawn to the museum by the second furore.
   More and more frequently there were persons of strange and exotic
   aspect - swarthy Asiatics, long-haired nondescripts, and bearded brown
   men who seemed unused to European clothes - who would invariably
   inquire for the hall of mummies and would subsequently be found staring
   at the hideous Pacific specimen in a veritable ecstasy of fascination.
   Some quiet, sinister undercurrent in this flood of eccentric foreigners
   seemed to impress all the guards, and I myself was far from
   undisturbed. I could not help thinking of the prevailing cult-stirrings
   among just such exotics as these - and the connexion of those stirrings
   with myths all too close to the frightful mummy and its cylinder
   scroll.

   At times I was half tempted to withdraw the mummy from exhibition -
   especially when an attendant told me that he had several times glimpsed
   strangers making odd obeisances before it, and had overheard singsong
   mutterings which sounded like chants or rituals addressed to it at
   hours when the visiting throngs were somewhat thinned. One of the
   guards acquired a queer nervous hallucination about the petrified
   horror in the lone glass case, alleging that he could see from day to
   day certain vague, subtle, and infinitely slight changes in the frantic
   flexion of the bony claws, and in the fear-crazed expression of the
   leathery face. He could not get rid of the loathsome idea that those
   horrible, bulging eyes were about to pop suddenly open.

   It was early in September, when the curious crowds had lessened and the
   hall of mummies was sometimes vacant, that the attempt to get at the
   mummy by cutting the glass of its case was made. The culprit, a swarthy
   Polynesian, was spied in time by a guard, and was overpowered before
   any damage occurred. Upon investigation the fellow turned out to be an
   Hawaiian notorious for his activity in certain underground religious
   cults, and having a considerable police record in connexion with
   abnormal and inhuman rites and sacrifices. Some of the papers found in
   his room were highly puzzling and disturbing, including many sheets
   covered with hieroglyphs closely resembling those on the scroll at the
   museum and in the Black Book of von Junzt; but regarding these things
   he could not be prevailed upon to speak.

   Scarcely a week after this incident, another attempt to get at the
   mummy - this time by tampering with the lock of his case - resulted in
   a second arrest. The offender, a Cingalese, had as long and unsavoury a
   record of loathsome cult activities as the Hawaiian had possessed, and
   displayed a kindred unwillingness to talk to the police. What made this
   case doubly and darkly interesting was that a guard had noticed this
   man several times before, and had heard him addressing to the mummy a
   peculiar chant containing unmistakable repetitions of the word "T'yog".
   As a result of this affair I doubled the guards in the hall of mummies,
   and ordered them never to leave the now notorious specimen out of
   sight, even for a moment.

   As may well be imagined, the press made much of these two incidents,
   reviewing its talk of primal and fabulous Mu, and claiming boldly that
   the hideous mummy was none other than the daring heretic T'yog,
   petrified by something he had seen in the pre-human citadel he had
   invaded, and preserved intact through 175,000 years of our planet's
   turbulent history. That the strange devotees represented cults
   descended from Mu, and that they were worshipping the mummy - or
   perhaps even seeking to awaken it to life by spells and incantations -
   was emphasised and reiterated in the most sensational fashion.

   Writers exploited the insistence of the old legends that the brain of
   Ghatanothoa's petrified victims remained conscious and unaffected - a
   point which served as a basis for the wildest and most improbable
   speculations. The mention of a "true scroll" also received due
   attention - it being the prevailing popular theory that T'yog's stolen
   charm against Ghatanothoa was somewhere in existence, and that
   cult-members were trying to bring it into contact with T'yog himself
   for some purpose of their own. One result of this exploitation was that
   a third wave of gaping visitors began flooding the museum and staring
   at the hellish mummy which served as a nucleus for the whole strange
   and disturbing affair.

   It was among this wave of spectators - many of whom made repeated
   visits - that talk of the mummy's vaguely changing aspect first began
   to be widespread. I suppose - despite the disturbing notion of the
   nervous guard some months before - that the museum's personnel was too
   well used to the constant sight of odd shapes to pay close attention to
   details; in any case, it was the excited whispers of visitors which at
   length aroused the guards to the subtle mutation which was apparently
   in progress. Almost simultaneously the press got hold of it - with
   blatant results which can well be imagined.

   Naturally, I gave the matter my most careful observation, and by the
   middle of October decided that a definite disintegration of the mummy
   was under way. Through some chemical or physical influence in the air,
   the half-stony, half-leathery fibres seemed to be gradually relaxing,
   causing distinct variations in the angles of the limbs and in certain
   details of the fear-twisted facial expression. After a half-century of
   perfect preservation this was a highly disconcerting development, and I
   had the museum's taxidermist, Dr. Moore, go carefully over the gruesome
   object several times. He reported a general relaxation and softening,
   and gave the thing two or three astringent sprayings, but did not dare
   to attempt anything drastic lest there be a sudden crumbling and
   accelerated decay.

   The effect of all this upon the gaping crowds was curious. Heretofore
   each new sensation sprung by the press had brought fresh waves of
   staring and whispering visitors, but now - though the papers blathered
   endlessly about the mummy's changes - the public seemed to have
   acquired a definite sense of fear which outranked even its morbid
   curiosity. People seemed to feel that a sinister aura hovered over the
   museum, and from a high peak the attendance fell to a level distinctly
   below normal. This lessened attendance gave added prominence to the
   stream of freakish foreigners who continued to infest the place, and
   whose numbers seemed in no way diminished.

   On November 18th a Peruvian of Indian blood suffered a strange
   hysterical or epileptic seizure in front of the mummy, afterward
   shrieking from his hospital cot, "It tried to open its eyes! - T'yog
   tried to open his eyes and stare at me!" I was by this time on the
   point of removing the object from exhibition, but permitted myself to
   be overruled at a meeting of our very conservative directors. However,
   I could see that the museum was beginning to acquire an unholy
   reputation in its austere and quiet neighbourhood. After this incident
   I gave instructions that no one be allowed to pause before the
   monstrous Pacific relic for more than a few minutes at a time.

   It was on November 24th, after the museum's five o'clock closing, that
   one of the guards noticed a minute opening of the mummy's eyes. The
   phenomenon was very slight - nothing but a thin crescent of cornea
   being visible in either eye - but it was none the less of the highest
   interest. Dr. Moore, having been summoned hastily, was about to study
   the exposed bits of eyeball with a magnifier when his handling of the
   mummy caused the leathery lids to fall tightly shut again. All gentle
   efforts to open them failed, and the taxidermist did not dare to apply
   drastic measures. When he notified me of all this by telephone I felt a
   sense of mounting dread hard to reconcile with the apparently simple
   event concerned. For a moment I could share the popular impression that
   some evil, amorphous blight from unplumbed deeps of time and space hung
   murkily and menacingly over the museum.

   Two nights later a sullen Filipino was trying to secrete himself in the
   museum at closing time. Arrested and taken to the station, he refused
   even to give his name, and was detained as a suspicious person.
   Meanwhile the strict surveillance of the mummy seemed to discourage the
   odd hordes of foreigners from haunting it. At least, the number of
   exotic visitors distinctly fell off after the enforcement of the "move
   along" order.

   It was during the early morning hours of Thursday, December 1st, that a
   terrible climax developed. At about one o'clock horrible screams of
   mortal fright and agony were heard issuing from the museum, and a
   series of frantic telephone calls from neighbours brought to the scene
   quickly and simultaneously a squad of police and several museum
   officials, including myself. Some of the policemen surrounded the
   building while others, with the officials, cautiously entered. In the
   main corridor we found the night watchman strangled to death - a bit of
   East Indian hemp still knotted around his neck - and realised that
   despite all precautions some darkly evil intruder or intruders had
   gained access to the place. Now, however, a tomblike silence enfolded
   everything and we almost feared to advance upstairs to the fateful wing
   where we knew the core of the trouble must lurk. We felt a bit more
   steadied after flooding the building with light from the central
   switches in the corridor, and finally crept reluctantly up the curving
   staircase and through a lofty archway to the hall of mummies.

V[edit]

   It is from this point onward that reports of the hideous case have been
   censored - for we have all agreed that no good can be accomplished by a
   public knowledge of those terrestrial conditions implied by the further
   developments. I have said that we flooded the whole building with light
   before our ascent. Now beneath the beams that beat down on the
   glistening cases and their gruesome contents, we saw outspread a mute
   horror whose baffling details testified to happenings utterly beyond
   our comprehension. There were two intruders - who we afterward agreed
   must have hidden in the building before closing time - but they would
   never be executed for the watchman's murder. They had already paid the
   penalty.

   One was a Burmese and the other a Fiji-Islander - both known to the
   police for their share in frightful and repulsive cult activities. They
   were dead, and the more we examined them the more utterly monstrous and
   unnamable we felt their manner of death to be. On both faces was a more
   wholly frantic and inhuman look of fright than even the oldest
   policeman had ever seen before; yet in the state of the two bodies
   there were vast and significant differences.

   The Burmese lay collapsed close to the nameless mummy's case, from
   which a square of glass had been neatly cut. In his right hand was a
   scroll of bluish membrane which I at once saw was covered with greyish
   hieroglyphs - almost a duplicate of the scroll in the strange cylinder
   in the library downstairs, though later study brought out subtle
   differences. There was no mark of violence on the body, and in view of
   the desperate, agonised expression on the twisted face we could only
   conclude that the man died of sheer fright.

   It was the closely adjacent Fijian, though, that gave us the
   profoundest shock. One of the policemen was the first to feel of him,
   and the cry of fright he emitted added another shudder to that
   neighbourhood's night of terror. We ought to have known from the lethal
   greyness of the once-black, fear-twisted face, and of the bony hands -
   one of which still clutched an electric torch - that something was
   hideously wrong; yet every one of us was unprepared for what that
   officer's hesitant touch disclosed. Even now I can think of it only
   with a paroxysm of dread and repulsion. To be brief - the hapless
   invader, who less than an hour before had been a sturdy living
   Melanesian bent on unknown evils, was now a rigid, ash-grey figure of
   stony, leathery petrification, in every respect identical with the
   crouching, aeon-old blasphemy in the violated glass case.

   Yet that was not the worst. Crowning all other horrors, and indeed
   seizing our shocked attention before we turned to the bodies on the
   floor, was the state of the frightful mummy. No longer could its
   changes be called vague and subtle, for it had now made radical shifts
   of posture. It had sagged and slumped with a curious loss of rigidity;
   its bony claws had sunk until they no longer even partly covered its
   leathery, fearcrazed face; and - God help us! - its hellish bulging
   eyes had popped wide open, and seemed to be staring directly at the two
   intruders who had died of fright or worse.

   That ghastly, dead-fish stare was hideously mesmerising, and it haunted
   us all the time we were examining the bodies of the invaders. Its
   effect on our nerves was damnably queer, for we somehow felt a curious
   rigidity creeping over us and hampering our simplest motions - a
   rigidity which later vanished very oddly when we passed the
   hieroglyphed scroll around for inspection. Every now and then I felt my
   gaze drawn irresistibly toward those horrible bulging eyes in the case,
   and when I returned to study them after viewing the bodies I thought I
   detected something very singular about the glassy surface of the dark
   and marvellously well-preserved pupils. The more I looked, the more
   fascinated I became; and at last I went down to the office - despite
   that strange stiffness in my limbs - and brought up a strong multiple
   magnifying glass. With this I commenced a very close and careful survey
   of the fishy pupils, while the others crowded expectantly around.

   I had always been rather sceptical of the theory that scenes and
   objects become photographed on the retina of the eye in cases of death
   or coma; yet no sooner did I look through the lens than I realised the
   presence of some sort of image other than the room's reflection in the
   glassy, bulging optics of this nameless spawn of the aeons. Certainly,
   there was a dimly outlined scene on the age-old retinal surface, and I
   could not doubt that it formed the last thing on which those eyes had
   looked in life - countless millennia ago. It seemed to be steadily
   fading, and I fumbled with the magnifier in order to shift another lens
   into place. Yet it must have been accurate and clear-cut; even if
   infinitesimally small, when - in response to some evil spell or act
   connected with their visit - it had confronted those intruders who were
   frightened to death. With the extra lens I could make out many details
   formerly invisible, and the awed group around me hung on the flood of
   words with which I tried to tell what I saw.

   For here, in the year 1932, a man in the city of Boston was looking on
   something which belonged to an unknown and utterly alien world - a
   world that vanished from existence and normal memory aeons ago. There
   was a vast room - a chamber of Cyclopean masonry - and I seemed to be
   viewing it from one of its corners. On the walls were carvings so
   hideous that even in this imperfect image their stark blasphemousness
   and bestiality sickened me. I could not believe that the carvers of
   these things were human, or that they had ever seen human beings when
   they shaped the frightful outlines which leered at the beholder. In the
   centre of the chamber was a colossal trap-door of stone, pushed upward
   to permit the emergence of some object from below. The object should
   have been clearly visible - indeed, must have been when the eyes first
   opened before the fear-stricken intruders - though under my lenses it
   was merely a monstrous blur.

   As it happened, I was studying the right eye only when I brought the
   extra magnification into play. A moment later I wished fervently that
   my search had ended there. As it was, however, the zeal of discovery
   and revelation was upon me, and I shifted my powerful lenses to the
   mummy's left eye in the hope of finding the image less faded on that
   retina. My hands, trembling with excitement and unnaturally stiff from
   some obscure influence, were slow in bringing the magnifier into focus,
   but a moment later I realised that the image was less faded than in the
   other eye. I saw in a morbid flash of half-distinctness the
   insufferable thing which was welling up through the prodigious
   trap-door in that Cyclopean, immemorially archaic crypt of a lost world
   - and fell fainting with an inarticulate shriek of which I am not even
   ashamed.

   By the time I revived there was no distinct image of anything in either
   eye of the monstrous mummy. Sergeant Keefe of the police looked with my
   glass, for I could not bring myself to face that abnormal entity again.
   And I thanked all the powers of the cosmos that I had not looked
   earlier than I did. It took all my resolution, and a great deal of
   solicitation, to make me relate what I had glimpsed in the hideous
   moment of revelation. Indeed, I could not speak till we had all
   adjourned to the office below, out of sight of that daemoniac thing
   which could not be. For I had begun to harbour the most terrible and
   fantastic notions about the mummy and its glassy, bulging eyes - that
   it had a kind of hellish consciousness, seeing all that occurred before
   it and trying vainly to communicate some frightful message from the
   gulfs of time. That meant madness - but at last I thought I might be
   better off if I told what I had half seen.

   After all, it was not a long thing to tell. Oozing and surging up out
   of that yawning trap-door in the Cyclopean crypt I had glimpsed such an
   unbelievable behemothic monstrosity that I could not doubt the power of
   its original to kill with its mere sight. Even now I cannot begin to
   suggest it with any words at my command. I might call it gigantic -
   tentacled - proboscidian - octopus-eyed - semi-amorphous - plastic -
   partly squamous and partly rugose - ugh! But nothing I could say could
   even adumbrate the loathsome, unholy, non-human, extra-galactic horror
   and hatefulness and unutterable evil of that forbidden spawn of black
   chaos and illimitable night. As I write these words the associated
   mental image causes me to lean back faint and nauseated. As I told of
   the sight to the men around me in the office, I had to fight to
   preserve the consciousness I had regained.

   Nor were my hearers much less moved. Not a man spoke above a whisper
   for a full quarter-hour, and there were awed, half-furtive references
   to the frightful lore in the Black Book, to the recent newspaper tales
   of cult-stirrings, and to the sinister events in the museum.
   Ghatanothoa . . . Even its smallest perfect image could petrify - T'yog
   - the false scroll - he never came back - the true scroll which could
   fully or partly undo the petrification - did it survive? - the hellish
   cults - the phrases overheard - "It is none other than he" - "He had
   looked upon its face" - "He knows all, though he can neither see nor
   feel" - "He had brought the memory down through the aeons" - "The true
   scroll will release him" - "Nagob has the true scroll" - "He can tell
   where to find it." Only the healing greyness of the dawn brought us
   back to sanity; a sanity which made of that glimpse of mine a closed
   topic - something not to be explained or thought of again.

   We gave out only partial reports to the press, and later on cooperated
   with the papers in making other suppressions. For example, when the
   autopsy shewed the brain and several other internal organs of the
   petrified Fijian to be fresh and unpetrified, though hermetically
   sealed by the petrification of the exterior flesh - an anomaly about
   which physicians are still guardedly and bewilderedly debating - we did
   not wish a furore to be started. We knew too well what the yellow
   journals, remembering what was said of the intact-brained and
   still-conscious state of Ghatanothoa's stony-leathery victims, would
   make of this detail.

   As matters stood, they pointed out that the man who had held the
   hieroglyphed scroll - and who had evidently thrust it at the mummy
   through the opening in the case - was not petrified, while the man who
   had not held it was. When they demanded that we make certain
   experiments - applying the scroll both to the stony-leathery body of
   the Fijian and to the mummy itself - we indignantly refused to abet
   such superstitious notions. Of course, the mummy was withdrawn from
   public view and transferred to the museum laboratory awaiting a really
   scientific examination before some suitable medical authority.
   Remembering past events, we kept it under a strict guard; but even so,
   an attempt was made to enter the museum at 2:25 a.m. on December 5th.
   Prompt working of the burglar alarm frustrated the design, though
   unfortunately the criminal or criminals escaped.

   That no hint of anything further ever reached the public, I am
   profoundly thankful. I wish devoutly that there were nothing more to
   tell. There will, of course, be leaks, and if anything happens to me I
   do not know what my executors will do with this manuscript; but at
   least the case will not be painfully fresh in the multitude's memory
   when the revelation comes. Besides, no one will believe the facts when
   they are finally told. That is the curious thing about the multitude.
   When their yellow press makes hints, they are ready to swallow
   anything; but when a stupendous and abnormal revelation is actually
   made, they laugh it aside as a lie. For the sake of general sanity it
   is probably better so.

   I have said that a scientific examination of the frightful mummy was
   planned. This took place on December 8th, exactly a week after the
   hideous culmination of events, and was conducted by the eminent Dr.
   William Minot, in conjunction with Wentworth Moore, Sc.D., taxidermist
   of the museum. Dr. Minot had witnessed the autopsy of the oddly
   petrified Fijian the week before. There were also present Messrs.
   Lawrence Cabot and Dudley Saltonstall of the museum's trustees, Drs.
   Mason, Wells, and Carver of the museum staff, two representatives of
   the press, and myself. During the week the condition of the hideous
   specimen had not visibly changed, though some relaxation of its fibres
   caused the position of the glassy, open eyes to shift slightly from
   time to time. All of the staff dreaded to look at the thing - for its
   suggestion of quiet, conscious watching had become intolerable - and it
   was only with an effort that I could bring myself to attend the
   examination.

   Dr. Minot arrived shortly after 1:00 p.m., and within a few minutes
   began his survey of the mummy. Considerable disintegration took place
   under his hands, and in view of this - and of what we told him
   concerning the gradual relaxation of the specimen since the first of
   October - he decided that a thorough dissection ought to be made before
   the substance was further impaired. The proper instruments being
   present in the laboratory equipment, he began at once; exclaiming aloud
   at the odd, fibrous nature of the grey, mummified substance.

   But his exclamation was still louder when he made the first deep
   incision, for out of that cut there slowly trickled a thick crimson
   stream whose nature - despite the infinite ages dividing this hellish
   mummy's lifetime from the present - was utterly unmistakable. A few
   more deft strokes revealed various organs in astonishing degrees of
   non-petrified preservation - all, indeed, being intact except where
   injuries to the petrified exterior had brought about malformation or
   destruction. The resemblance of this condition to that found in the
   fright-killed Fiji-Islander was so strong that the eminent physician
   gasped in bewilderment. The perfection of those ghastly bulging eyes
   was uncanny, and their exact state with respect to petrification was
   very difficult to determine.

   At 3:30 p.m. the brain-case was opened - and ten minutes later our
   stunned group took an oath of secrecy which only such guarded documents
   as this manuscript will ever modify. Even the two reporters were glad
   to confirm the silence. For the opening had revealed a pulsing, living
   brain.

   We are the valiant Knights of Peace
   Who prattle for the Right:
   Our banner is of snowy fleece,
   Inscrib'd: "TOO PROUD TO FIGHT!"

   By sweet Chautauqua's flow'ry banks
   We love to sing and play,
   But should we spy a foeman's ranks!
   We'd proudly run away!

   When Prussian fury sweeps the main
   Our freedom to deny;
   Of tyrant laws we ne'er complain;
   But gladsomely comply!

   We do not fear the submarines
   That plough the troubled foam;
   We scorn the ugly old machines -
   And safely stay at home!

   They say our country's close to war
   And soon must man the guns;
   But we see naught to struggle for -
   We love the gentle Huns!

   What though their hireling Greaser bands
   Invade our southern plains?
   We well can spare those boist'rous lands,
   Content with what remains!

   Our fathers were both rude and bold,
   And would not live like brothers;
   But we are of a finer mould -
   We're much more like our mothers!

Pickman's Model

   From Wikisource

   Pickman's Model  (1926)
   by H. P. Lovecraft

    Pickman's Model was written in September 1926 and first published in
    the October 1927 issue of Weird Tales (Vol. 10, No. 4, p. 505-14).--
     Excerpted from Pickman's Model on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

   8519Pickman's ModelH. P. Lovecraft1926

   You needn't think I'm crazy, Eliot -- plenty of others have queerer
   prejudices than this. Why don't you laugh at Oliver's grandfather, who
   won't ride in a motor? If I don't like that damned subway, it's my own
   business; and we got here more quickly anyhow in the taxi. We'd have
   had to walk up the hill from Park Street if we'd taken the car.
         I know I'm more nervous than I was when you saw me last year, but
   you don't need to hold a clinic over it. There's plenty of reason, God
   knows, and I fancy I'm lucky to be sane at all. Why the third degree?
   You didn't use to be so inquisitive.
         Well, if you must hear it, I don't know why you shouldn't. Maybe
   you ought to, anyhow, for you kept writing me like a grieved parent
   when you heard I'd begun to cut the Art Club and keep away from
   Pickman. Now that he's disappeared I go round to the club once in a
   while, but my nerves aren't what they were.
         No, I don't know what's become of Pickman, and I don't like to
   guess. You might have surmised I had some inside information when I
   dropped him -- and that's why I don't want to think where he's gone.
   Let the police find what they can -- it won't be much, judging from the
   fact that they don't know yet of the old North End place he hired under
   the name of Peters.
         I'm not sure that I could find it again myself -- not that I'd
   ever try, even in broad daylight!
         Yes, I do know, or am afraid I know, why he maintained it. I'm
   coming to that. And I think you'll understand before I'm through why I
   don't tell the police. They would ask me to guide them, but I couldn't
   go back there even if I knew the way. There was something there -- and
   now I can't use the subway or (and you may as well have your laugh at
   this, too) go down into cellars any more.
         I should think you'd have known I didn't drop Pickman for the
   same silly reasons that fussy old women like Dr. Reid or Joe Minot or
   Rosworth did. Morbid art doesn't shock me, and when a man has the
   genius Pickman had I feel it an honour to know him, no matter what
   direction his work takes. Boston never had a greater painter than
   Richard Upton Pickman. I said it at first and I say it still, and I
   never swerved an inch, either, when he showed that 'Ghoul Feeding'.
   That, you remember, was when Minot cut him.
         You know, it takes profound art and profound insight into Nature
   to turn out stuff like Pickman's. Any magazine-cover hack can splash
   paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a Witches' Sabbath or a
   portrait of the devil, but only a great painter can make such a thing
   really scare or ring true. That's because only a real artist knows the
   actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear -- the exact
   sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or
   hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and
   lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness. I don't have
   to tell you why a Fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap
   ghost-story frontispiece merely makes us laugh. There's something those
   fellows catch -- beyond life -- that they're able to make us catch for
   a second. Doré had it. Sime has it. Angarola of Chicago has it. And
   Pickman had it as no man ever had it before or -- I hope to Heaven --
   ever will again.
         Don't ask me what it is they see. You know, in ordinary art,
   there's all the difference in the world between the vital, breathing
   things drawn from Nature or models and the artificial truck that
   commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule. Well, I should
   say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes
   models, or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral
   world he lives in. Anyhow, he manages to turn out results that differ
   from the pretender's mince-pie dreams in just about the same way that
   the life painter's results differ from the concoctions of a
   correspondence-school cartoonist. If I had ever seen what Pickman saw
   -- but no! Here, let's have a drink before we get any deeper. God, I
   wouldn't be alive if I'd ever seen what that man -- if he was a man --
   saw !
         You recall that Pickman's forte was faces. I don't believe
   anybody since Goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of
   features or a twist of expression. And before Goya you have to go back
   to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre
   Dame and Mont Saint-Michel. They believed all sorts of things -- and
   maybe they saw all sorts of things, too, for the Middle Ages had some
   curious phases. I remember your asking Pickman yourself once, the year
   before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and
   visions. Wasn't that a nasty laugh he gave you? It was partly because
   of that laugh that Reid dropped him. Reid, you know, had just taken up
   comparative pathology, and was full of pompous 'inside stuff' about the
   biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or
   physical symptom. He said Pickman repelled him more and more every day,
   and almost frightened him towards the last -- that the fellow's
   features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didn't like;
   in a way that wasn't human. He had a lot of talk about diet, and mid
   Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree. I suppose
   you told Reid, if you and he had any correspondence over it, that he'd
   let Pickman's paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination.
   I know I told him that myself -- then.
         But keep in mind that I didn't drop Pickman for anything like
   this. On the contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that
   'Ghoul Feeding' was a tremendous achievement. As you know, the club
   wouldn't exhibit it, and the Museum of Fine Arts wouldn't accept it as
   a gift; and I can add that nobody would buy it, so Pickman had it right
   in his house till he went. Now his father has it in Salem -- you know
   Pickman comes of old Salem stock, and had a witch ancestor hanged in
   1692.
         I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often,
   especially after I began making notes for a monograph on weird art.
   Probably it was his work which put the idea into my head, and anyhow, I
   found him a mine of data and suggestions when I came to develop it. He
   showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about; including some
   pen-and-ink sketches that would, I verily believe, have got him kicked
   out of the club if many of the members had seen them. Before long I was
   pretty nearly a devotee, and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to
   art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him
   for the Danvers asylum. My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that
   people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him,
   made him get very confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that
   if I were fairly close-mouthed and none too squeamish, he might show me
   something rather unusual -- something a bit stronger than anything he
   had in the house.
         'You know,' he said, 'there are things that won't do for Newbury
   Street -- things that are out of place here, and that can't be
   conceived here, anyhow. It's my business to catch the overtones of the
   soul, and you won't find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets
   on made land. Back Bay isn't Boston -- it isn't anything yet, because
   it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits. If
   there are any ghosts here, they're the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and
   a shallow cove; and I want human ghosts -- the ghosts of beings highly
   organized enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what
   they saw.
         'The place for an artist to live is the North End. If any
   aesthete were sincere, he'd put up with the slums for the sake of the
   massed traditions. God, man! Don't you realize that places like that
   weren't merely made, but actually grew? Generation after generation
   lived and felt and died there, and in days when people weren't afraid
   to live and feel and die. Don't you know there was a mill on Copp's
   Hill in 1632, and that half the present streets were laid out by 1650?
   I can show you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and
   more; houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble
   into powder. What do moderns know of life and the forces behind it? You
   call the Salem witchcraft a delusion, but I'll wager my
   four-times-great-grandmother could have told you things. They hanged
   her on Gallows Hill, with Cotton Mather looking sanctimoniously on.
   Mather, damn him, was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of
   this accursed cage of monotony -- I wish someone had laid a spell on
   him or sucked his blood in the night!
         'I can show you a house he lived in, and I can show you another
   one he was afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk. He knew
   things he didn't dare put into that stupid Magnalia or that puerile
   Wonders of the Invisible World. Look here, do you know the whole North
   End once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with
   each other's houses, and the burying ground, and the sea? Let them
   prosecute and persecute above ground -- things went on every day that
   they couldn't reach, and voices laughed at night that they couldn't
   place!
         'Why, man, out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not
   moved since I'll wager that in eight I can show you something queer in
   the cellar. There's hardly a month that you don't read of workmen
   finding bricked-up arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old
   place as it comes down -- you could see one near Henchman Street from
   the elevated last year. There were witches and what their spells
   summoned; pirates and what they brought in from the sea; smugglers;
   privateers -- and I tell you, people knew how to live, and how to
   enlarge the bounds of life, in the old time! This wasn't the only world
   a bold and wise man could know -- faugh! And to think of today in
   contrast, with such pale-pink brains that even a club of supposed
   artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the
   feelings of a Beacon Street tea-table!
         'The only saving grace of the present is that it's too damned
   stupid to question the past very closely. What do maps and records and
   guide-books really tell of the North End? Bah! At a guess I'll
   guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys
   north of Prince Street that aren't suspected by ten living beings
   outside of the foreigners that swarm them. And what do those Dagoes
   know of their meaning? No, Thurber, these ancient places are dreaming
   gorgeously and over-flowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the
   commonplace, and yet there's not a living soul to understand or profit
   by them. Or rather, there's only one living soul -- for I haven't been
   digging around in the past for nothing!
         'See here, you're interested in this sort of thing. What if I
   told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the
   night-spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even
   think of in Newbury Street? Naturally I don't tell those cursed old
   maids at the club -- with Reid, damn him, whispering even as it is that
   I'm a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution.
   Yes, Thurber, I decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as
   beauty from life, so I did some exploring in places where I had reason
   to know terror lives.
         'I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men
   besides myself have ever seen. It isn't so very far from the elevated
   as distance goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes. I took it
   because of the queer old brick well in the cellar -- one of the sort I
   told you about. The shack's almost tumbling down so that nobody else
   would live there, and I'd hate to tell you how little I pay for it. The
   windows are boarded up, but I like that all the better, since I don't
   want daylight for what I do. I paint in the cellar, where the
   inspiration is thickest, but I've other rooms furnished on the ground
   floor. A Sicilian owns it, and I've hired it under the name of Peters.
         'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight. I think you'd
   enjoy the pictures, for, as I said, I've let myself go a bit there.
   It's no vast tour -- I sometimes do it on foot, for I don't want to
   attract attention with a taxi in such a place. We can take the shuttle
   at the South Station for Battery Street, and after that the walk isn't
   much.'
         Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue
   but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant
   cab we could sight. We changed to the elevated at the South Station,
   and at about twelve o'clock had climbed down the steps at Battery
   Street and struck along the old waterfront past Constitution Wharf. I
   didn't keep track of the cross streets, and can't tell you yet which it
   was we turned up, but I know it wasn't Greenough Lane.
         When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of
   the oldest and dirtiest alley I ever saw in my life, with
   crumbling-looking gables, broken small-paned windows, and archaic
   chimneys that stood out half-disintegrated against the moonlit sky. I
   don't believe there were three houses in sight that hadn't been
   standing in Cotton Mather's time -- certainly I glimpsed at least two
   with an overhang, and once I thought I saw a peaked roof-line of the
   almost forgotten pre-gambrel type, though antiquarians tell us there
   are none left in Boston.
         From that alley, which had a dim light, we turned to the left
   into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all:
   and in a minute made what I think was an obtuse-angled bend towards the
   right in the dark. Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight
   and revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably
   worm-eaten. Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren hallway with what
   was once splendid dark-oak panelling -- simple, of course, but
   thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the
   Witchcraft. Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil
   lamp, and told me to make myself at home.
         Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly
   'hard-boiled,' but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that
   room gave me a bad turn. They were his pictures, you know -- the ones
   he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street -- and he was right
   when he said he had 'let himself go.' Here -- have another drink -- I
   need one anyhow!
         There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like,
   because the awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable
   loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond
   the power of words to classify. There was none of the exotic technique
   you see in Sidney Sime, none of the trans-Saturnian landscapes and
   lunar fungi that Clark Ashton Smith uses to freeze the blood. The
   backgrounds were mostly old churchyards, deep woods, cliffs by the sea,
   brick tunnels, ancient panelled rooms, or simple vaults of masonry.
   Copp's Hill Burying Ground, which could not be many blocks away from
   this very house, was a favourite scene.
         The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground
   -- for Pickman's morbid art was pre-eminently one of demoniac
   portraiture. These figures were seldom completely human, but often
   approached humanity in varying degree. Most of the bodies, while
   roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a vaguely canine cast. The
   texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness. Ugh! I
   can see them now! Their occupations -- well, don't ask me to be too
   precise. They were usually feeding -- I won't say on what. They were
   sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages, and
   often appeared to be in battle over their prey -- or rather, their
   treasure-trove. And what damnable expressiveness Pickman sometimes gave
   the sightless faces of this charnel booty! Occasionally the things were
   shown leaping through open windows at night, or squatting on the chests
   of sleepers, worrying at their throats. One canvas showed a ring of
   them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill, whose dead face held
   a close kinship to theirs.
         But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of
   theme and setting which struck me faint. I'm not a three-year-old kid,
   and I'd seen much like this before. It was the faces, Eliot, those
   accursed faces, that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the
   very breath of life! By God, man, I verily believe they were alive!
   That nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment, and his
   brush had been a nightmare-spawning wand. Give me that decanter, Eliot!
         There was one thing called 'The Lesson' -- Heaven pity me, that I
   ever saw it! Listen -- can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless
   dog-like things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like
   themselves? The price of a changeling, I suppose -- you know the old
   myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in
   exchange for the human babes they steal. Pickman was showing what
   happens to those stolen babes -- how they grow up -- and then I began
   to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and non-human
   figures. He was, in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly
   non-human and the degradedly human, establishing a sardonic linkage and
   evolution. The dog-things were developed from mortals!
         And no sooner had I wondered what he made of their own young as
   left with mankind in the form of changelings, than my eye caught a
   picture embodying that very thought. It was that of an ancient Puritan
   interior -- a heavily beamed room with lattice windows, a settle, and
   clumsy seventeenth-century furniture, with the family sitting about
   while the father read from the Scriptures. Every face but one showed
   nobility and reverence, but that one reflected the mockery of the pit.
   It was that of a young man in years, and no doubt belonged to a
   supposed son of that pious father, but in essence it was the kin of the
   unclean things. It was their changeling -- and in a spirit of supreme
   irony Pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to
   his own.
         By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and
   was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to
   see his 'modern studies.' I hadn't been able to give him much of my
   opinions -- I was too speechless with fright and loathing -- but I
   think he fully understood and felt highly complimented. And now I want
   to assure you again, Eliot, that I'm no mollycoddle to scream at
   anything which shows a bit of departure from the usual. I'm middle-aged
   and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France
   to know I'm not easily knocked out. Remember, too, that I'd just about
   recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which
   turned colonial New England into a kind of annex of hell. Well, in
   spite of all this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I
   had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over. The other
   chamber had shown a pack of ghouls and witches over-running the world
   of our forefathers, but this one brought the horror right into our own
   daily life!
         God, how that man could paint! There was a study called 'Subway
   Accident,' in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from
   some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the Boston Street
   subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform. Another showed
   a dance on Copp's Hill among the tombs with the background of today.
   Then there were any number of cellar views, with monsters creeping in
   through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted
   behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend
   the stairs.
         One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of
   Beacon Hill, with ant-like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing
   themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground. Dances in the
   modern cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception somehow
   shocked me more than all the rest -- a scene in an unknown vault, where
   scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a well-known Boston
   guidebook and was evidently reading aloud. All were pointing to a
   certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and
   reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes.
   The title of the picture was, 'Holmes, Lowell and Longfellow Lie Buried
   in Mount Auburn.'
         As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second
   room of deviltry and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points
   in my sickening loathing. In the first place, I said to myself, these
   things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity
   they showed in Pickman. The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all
   mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the
   degradation of the mortal tenement. In the second place, they terrified
   because of their very greatness. Their art was the art that convinced
   -- when we saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were
   afraid of them. And the queer part was, that Pickman got none of his
   power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie. Nothing was blurred,
   distorted, or conventionalized; outlines were sharp and lifelike, and
   details were almost painfully defined. And the faces!
         It was not any mere artist's interpretation that we saw; it was
   pandemonium itself, crystal clear in stark objectivity. That was it, by
   Heaven! The man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all -- he did
   not even try to give us the churning, prismatic ephemera of dreams, but
   coldly and sardonically reflected some stable, mechanistic, and
   well-established horror -- world which he saw fully, brilliantly,
   squarely, and unfalteringly. God knows what that world can have been,
   or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted
   and crawled through it; but whatever the baffling source of his images,
   one thing was plain. Pickman was in every sense -- in conception and in
   execution -- a thorough, painstaking, and almost scientific realist.
         My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual
   studio, and I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the
   unfinished canvases. As we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he
   fumed his flash-light to a corner of the large open space at hand,
   revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in
   the earthen floor. We walked nearer, and I saw that it must be five
   feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the
   ground level- solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much
   mistaken. That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking
   about- an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the
   hill. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up, and that a
   heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover. Thinking of the things
   this well must have been connected with if Pickman's wild hints had not
   been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a
   step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with
   a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An acetylene gas outfit gave
   the light necessary for work.
         The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls
   were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and showed the
   painstaking methods of the artist. Scenes were blocked out with extreme
   care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which
   Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions. The man
   was great -- I say it even now, knowing as much as I do. A large camera
   on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in
   taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from
   photographs in the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town
   for this or that view. He thought a photograph quite as good as an
   actual scene or model for sustained work, and declared he employed them
   regularly.
         There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches
   and half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of
   the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side
   away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream --
   the second I had emitted that night. It echoed and echoed through the
   dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke
   back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical
   laughter. Merciful Creator! Eliot, but I don't know how much was real
   and how much was feverish fancy. It doesn't seem to me that earth can
   hold a dream like that!
         It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes,
   and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the
   head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy. Its position was a kind of
   crouch, and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its
   present prey and seek a juicier morsel. But damn it all, it wasn't even
   the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain-head of all
   panic -- not that, nor the dog face with its pointed ears, bloodshot
   eyes, flat nose, and drooling lips. It wasn't the scaly claws nor the
   mould-caked body nor the half-hooved feet -- none of these, though any
   one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madness.
         It was the technique, Eliot -- the cursed, the impious, the
   unnatural technique! As I am a living being, I never elsewhere saw the
   actual breath of life so fused into a canvas. The monster was there --
   it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared -- and I knew that only a
   suspension of Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a thing like
   that without a model -- without some glimpse of the nether world which
   no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had.
         Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a
   piece of paper now badly curled up -- probably, I thought, a photograph
   from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the
   nightmare it was to enhance. I reached out to uncurl and look at it,
   when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if shot. He had been listening
   with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked
   unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar, and now he seemed struck with a
   fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it more of the
   physical than of the spiritual. He drew a revolver and motioned me to
   silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door
   behind him.
         I think I was paralysed for an instant. Imitating Pickman's
   listening, I fancied I heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a
   series of squeals or beats in a direction I couldn't determine. I
   thought of huge rats and shuddered. Then there came a subdued sort of
   clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh -- a furtive, groping
   kind of clatter, though I can't attempt to convey what I mean in words.
   It was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick -- wood on brick --
   what did that make me think of?
         It came again, and louder. There was a vibration as if the wood
   had fallen farther than it had fallen before. After that followed a
   sharp grating noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the
   deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver, fired
   spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect. A
   muffled squeal or squawk, and a thud. Then more wood and brick grating,
   a pause, and the opening of the door -- at which I'll confess I started
   violently. Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the
   bloated rats that infested the ancient well.
         'The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,' he grinned, 'for those
   archaic tunnels touched graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast. But
   whatever it is, they must have run short, for they were devilish
   anxious to get out. Your yelling stirred them up, I fancy. Better be
   cautious in these old places -- our rodent friends are the one
   drawback, though I sometimes think they're a positive asset by way of
   atmosphere and colour.'
         Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure. Pickman
   had promised to show me the place, and Heaven knows he had done it. He
   led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction, it seems, for
   when we sighted a lamp-post we were in a half-familiar street with
   monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses. Charter
   Street, it turned out to be, but I was too flustered to notice just
   where we hit it. We were too late for the elevated, and walked back
   downtown through Hanover Street. I remember that wall. We switched from
   Tremont up Beacon, and Pickman left me at the corner of Joy, where I
   turned off. I never spoke to him again.
         Why did I drop him? Don't be impatient. Wait till I ring for
   coffee. We've had enough of the other stuff, but I for one need
   something. No -- it wasn't the paintings I saw in that place; though
   I'll swear they were enough to get him ostracised in nine-tenths of the
   homes and clubs of Boston, and I guess you won't wonder now why I have
   to steer clear of subways and cellars. It was -- something I found in
   my coat the next morning. You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the
   frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of
   some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster. That last
   scare had come while I was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had
   vacantly crumpled it into my pocket. But here's the coffee -- take it
   black, Eliot, if you're wise.
         Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton
   Pickman, the greatest artist I have ever known -- and the foulest being
   that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness.
   Eliot -- old Reid was right. He wasn't strictly human. Either he was
   born in strange shadow, or he'd found a way to unlock the forbidden
   gate. It's all the same now, for he's gone -- back into the fabulous
   darkness he loved to haunt. Here, let's have the chandelier going.
         Don't ask me to explain or even conjecture about what I burned.
   Don't ask me, either, what lay behind that mole-like scrambling Pickman
   was so keen to pass off as rats. There are secrets, you know, which
   might have come down from old Salem times, and Cotton Mather tells even
   stranger things. You know how damned lifelike Pickman's paintings were
   -- how we all wondered where he got those faces.
         Well -- that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after
   all. What it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on
   that awful canvas. It was the model he was using -- and its background
   was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail. But by God,
   Eliot, it was a photograph from life!

   Poetry and the Gods  (1920)
   by H. P. Lovecraft

   8832Poetry and the GodsH. P. Lovecraft1920

   A damp gloomy evening in April it was, just after the close of the
   Great War, when Marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and
   wishes, unheard-of yearnings which floated out of the spacious
   twentieth-century drawing room, up the deeps of the air, and eastward
   to olive groves in distant Arcady which she had seen only in her
   dreams. She had entered the room in abstraction, turned off the glaring
   chandeliers, and now reclined on a soft divan by a solitary lamp which
   shed over the reading table a green glow as soothing as moonlight when
   it issued through the foliage about an antique shrine.

   Attired simply, in a low-cut black evening dress, she appeared
   outwardly a typical product of modern civilization; but tonight she
   felt the immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic
   surroundings. Was it because of the strange home in which she lived,
   that abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the
   inmates scarcely more than strangers? Was it that, or was it some
   greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space, whereby she
   had been born too late, too early, or too far away from the haunts of
   her spirit ever to harmonize with the unbeautiful things of
   contemporary reality? To dispel the mood which was engulfing her more
   and more deeply each moment, she took a magazine from the table and
   searched for some healing bit of poetry. Poetry had always relieved her
   troubled mind better than anything else, though many things in the
   poetry she had seen detracted from the influence. Over parts of even
   the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of sterile ugliness and
   restraint, like dust on a window-pane through which one views a
   magnificent sunset.

   Listlessly turning the magazine's pages, as if searching for an elusive
   treasure, she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor.
   An observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had
   discovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her
   unattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before. It was
   only a bit of vers libre, that pitiful compromise of the poet who
   overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers; but it
   had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels, who
   gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty. Devoid of regularity, it yet
   had the harmony of winged, spontaneous words, a harmony missing from
   the formal, convention-bound verse she had known. As she read on, her
   surroundings gradually faded, and soon there lay about her only the
   mists of dream, the purple, star-strewn mists beyond time, where only
   Gods and dreamers walk.
Moon over Japan,
White butterfly moon!
Where the heavy-lidded Buddhas dream
To the sound of the cuckoo's call...
The white wings of moon butterflies
Flicker down the streets of the city,
Blushing into silence the useless wicks of sound-lanterns in the hands of girls

Moon over the tropics,
A white-curved bud
Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven...

The air is full of odours
And languorous warm sounds...
A flute drones its insect music to the night
Below the curving moon-petal of the heavens.

Moon over China, Weary moon on the river of the sky,
The stir of light in the willows is like the flashing of a thousand silver minno
ws
Through dark shoals;
The tiles on graves and rotting temples flash like ripples,
The sky is flecked with clouds like the scales of a dragon.

   Amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars, of
   her delight at the coming of a new age of song, a rebirth of Pan. Half
   closing her eyes, she repeated words whose melody lay hidden like
   crystals at the bottom of a stream before dawn, hidden but to gleam
   effulgently at the birth of day.
Moon over Japan,
White butterfly moon!

Moon over the tropics,
A white curved bud
Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven.
The air is full of odours
And languorous warm sounds...

Moon over China,
Weary moon on the river of the sky...

   Out of the mists gleamed godlike the form of a youth, in winged helmet
   and sandals, caduceus-bearing, and of a beauty like to nothing on
   earth. Before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which
   Apollo had given him in trade for the nine-corded shell of melody, and
   upon her brow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses. Then, adoring,
   Hermes spoke:

   "0 Nymph more fair than the golden-haired sisters of Cyene or the
   sky-inhabiting Atlantides, beloved of Aphrodite and blessed of Pallas,
   thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the Gods, which lieth in
   beauty and song. 0 Prophetess more lovely than the Sybil of Cumae when
   Apollo first knew her, thou has truly spoken of the new age, for even
   now on Maenalus, Pan sighs and stretches in his sleep, wishful to wake
   and behold about him the little rose-crowned fauns and the antique
   Satyrs. In thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal, saving only a
   few whom the world rejects, remembereth: that the Gods were never dead,
   but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of Gods in
   lotos-filled Hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset. And now
   draweth nigh the time of their awakening, when coldness and ugliness
   shall perish, and Zeus sit once more on Olympus. Already the sea about
   Paphos trembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on
   before, and at night on Helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings
   and half-remembered notes. Woods and fields are tremulous at twilight
   with the shimmering of white saltant forms, and immemorial Ocean yields
   up curious sights beneath thin moons. The Gods are patient, and have
   slept long, but neither man nor giant shall defy the Gods forever. In
   Tartarus the Titans writhe and beneath the fiery Aetna groan the
   children of Uranus and Gaea. The day now dawns when man must answer for
   centuries of denial, but in sleeping the Gods have grown kind and will
   not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of Gods. Instead will their
   vengeance smite the darkness, fallacy and ugliness which have turned
   the mind of man; and under the sway of bearded Saturnus shall mortals,
   once more sacrificing unto him, dwell in beauty and delight. This night
   shalt thou know the favour of the Gods, and behold on Parnassus those
   dreams which the Gods have through ages sent to earth to show that they
   are not dead. For poets are the dreams of Gods, and in each and every
   age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the promise from the
   lotosgardens beyond the sunset."

   Then in his arms Hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies.
   Gentle breezes from the tower of Aiolas wafted them high above warm,
   scented seas, till suddenly they came upon Zeus, holding court upon
   double-headed Parnassus, his golden throne flanked by Apollo and the
   Muses on the right hand, and by ivy-wreathed Dionysus and
   pleasure-flushed Bacchae on the left hand. So much of splendour Marcia
   had never seen before, either awake or in dreams, but its radiance did
   her no injury, as would have the radiance of lofty Olympus; for in this
   lesser court the Father of Gods had tempered his glories for the sight
   of mortals. Before the laurel-draped mouth of the Corycian cave sat in
   a row six noble forms with the aspect of mortals, but the countenances
   of Gods. These the dreamer recognized from images of them which she had
   beheld, and she knew that they were none else than the divine
   Maeonides, the avernian Dante, the more than mortal Shakespeare, the
   chaos-exploring Milton, the cosmic Goethe and the musalan Keats. These
   were those messengers whom the Gods had sent to tell men that Pan had
   passed not away, but only slept; for it is in poetry that Gods speak to
   men. Then spake the Thunderer:

   "0 Daughter--for, being one of my endless line, thou art indeed my
   daughter--behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers
   Gods have sent down that in the words and writing of men there may be
   still some traces of divine beauty. Other bards have men justly crowned
   with enduring laurels, but these hath Apollo crowned, and these have I
   set in places apart, as mortals who have spoken the language of the
   Gods. Long have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the West, and spoken
   only through our dreams; but the time approaches when our voices shall
   not be silent. It is a time of awakening and change. Once more hath
   Phaeton ridden low, searing the fields and drying the streams. In Gaul
   lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no
   more, and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals. Ares
   and his train have gone forth with the madness of Gods and have
   returned Deimos and Phobos glutted with unnatural delight. Tellus moons
   with grief, and the faces of men are as the faces of Erinyes, even as
   when Astraea fled to the skies, and the waves of our bidding
   encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone. Amidst this
   chaos, prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival, even
   now toileth our latest born messenger, in whose dreams are all the
   images which other messengers have dreamed before him. He it is that we
   have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the
   world hath known before, and to write words wherein shall echo all the
   wisdom and the loveliness of the past. He it is who shall proclaim our
   return and sing of the days to come when Fauns and Dryads shall haunt
   their accustomed groves in beauty. Guided was our choice by those who
   now sit before the Corycian grotto on thrones of ivory, and in whose
   songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou
   shalt know the greater messenger when he cometh. Attend their voices as
   one by one they sing to thee here. Each note shall thou hear again in
   the poetry which is to come, the poetry which shall bring peace and
   pleasure to thy soul, though search for it through bleak years thou
   must. Attend with diligence, for each chord that vibrates away into
   hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to earth, as
   Alpheus, sinking his waters into the soul of Hellas, appears as the
   crystal arethusa in remote Sicilia."

   Then arose Homeros, the ancient among bards, who took his lyre and
   chanted his hymn to Aphrodite. No word of Greek did Marcia know, yet
   did the message not fall vainly upon her ears, for in the cryptic
   rhythm was that which spake to all mortals and Gods, and needed no
   interpreter.

   So too the songs of Dante and Goethe, whose unknown words clave the
   ether with melodies easy to ready and adore. But at last remembered
   accents resounded before the listener. It was the Swan of Avon, once a
   God among men, and still a God among Gods:
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war,
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie;
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far,
His name with zealous fervour sanctify.

   Accents still more familiar arose as Milton, blind no more, declaimed
   immortal harmony:
Or let thy lamp at midnight hour
Be seen in some high lonely tower,
Where I might oft outwatch the Bear
With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere
The spirit of Plato, to unfold
What worlds or what vast regions hold
The immortal mind, that hath forsook
Her mansion in this fleshy nook.

Sometime let gorgeous tragedy
In sceptered pall come sweeping by,
Presenting Thebes, or Pelop's line,
Or the tale of Troy divine.

   Last of all came the young voice of Keats, closest of all the
   messengers to the beauteous faun-folk:
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
Are sweeter, therefore, yet sweet pipes, play on...

When old age shall this generation waste,
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st
"Beauty is truth -- truth beauty" -- that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

   As the singer ceased, there came a sound in the wind blowing from far
   Egypt, where at night Aurora mourns by the Nile for her slain Memnon.
   To the feet of the Thunderer flew the rosy-fingered Goddess and,
   kneeling, cried, "Master, it is time I unlocked the Gates of the East."
   And Phoebus, handing his lyre to Calliope, his bride among the Muses,
   prepared to depart for the jewelled and column-raised Palace of the
   Sun, where fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of
   Day. So Zeus descended from his carven throne and placed his hand upon
   the head of Marcia, saying:

   "Daughter, the dawn is nigh, and it is well that thou shouldst return
   before the awakening of mortals to thy home. Weep not at the bleakness
   of thy life, for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the
   Gods shall once more walk among men. Search thou unceasingly for our
   messenger, for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort. By his word
   shall thy steps be guided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty
   shall thy spirit find that which it craveth." As Zeus ceased, the young
   Hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading
   stars, up and westward over unseen seas.

   Many years have passed since Marcia dreamt of the Gods and of their
   Parnassus conclave. Tonight she sits in the same spacious drawing-room,
   but she is not alone. Gone is the old spirit of unrest, for beside her
   is one whose name is luminous with celebrity: the young poet of poets
   at whose feet sits all the world. He is reading from a manuscript words
   which none has ever heard before, but which when heard will bring to
   men the dreams and the fancies they lost so many centuries ago, when
   Pan lay down to doze in Arcady, and the great Gods withdrew to sleep in
   lotos-gardens beyond the lands of the Hesperides. In the subtle
   cadences and hidden melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden had
   found rest at last, for there echo the divinest notes of Thracian
   Orpheus, notes that moved the very rocks and trees by Hebrus' banks.
   The singer ceases, and with eagerness asks a verdict, yet what can
   Marcia say but that the strain is "fit for the Gods"?

   And as she speaks there comes again a vision of Parnassus and the
   far-off sound of a mighty voice saying, "By his word shall thy steps be
   guided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find
   all that it craveth."

        Into the north window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with
   uncanny light. All through the long hellish hours of blackness it
   shines there. And in the autumn of the year, when the winds from the
   north curse and whine, and the red-leaved trees of the swamp mutter
   things to one another in the small hours of the morning under the
   horned waning moon, I sit by the easement and watch that star. Down
   from the heights reels the glittering Cassiopeia as the hours wear on,
   while Charles' Wain lumbers up from behind the vapour-soaked swamp
   trees that sway in the night-wind. Just before dawn Arcturus winks
   ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock, and Coma Berenices
   shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east; but still the Pole
   Star leers down from the same place in the black vault, winking
   hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some
   strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to
   convey. Sometimes, when it is cloudy, I can sleep.

        Well do I remember the night of the great Aurora, when over the
   swamp played the shocking coruscations of the daemon-light. After the
   beams came clouds, and then I slept.

        And it was under a horned waning moon that I saw the city for the
   first time. Still and somnolent did it lie, on a strange plateau in a
   hollow betwixt strange peaks. Of ghastly marble were its walls and its
   towers, its columns, domes, and pavements. In the marble streets were
   marble pillars, the upper parts of which were carven into the images of
   grave bearded men. The air was warm and stirred not. And overhead,
   scarce ten degrees from the zenith, glowed that watching Pole Star.
   Long did I gaze on the city, but the day came not. When the red
   Aldebaran, which blinked low in the sky but never set, had crawled a
   quarter of the way around the horizon, I saw light and motion in the
   houses and the streets. Forms strangely robed, but at once noble and
   familiar, walked abroad, and under the horned waning moon men talked
   wisdom in a tongue which I understood, though it was unlike any
   language I had ever known. And when the red Aldebaran had crawled more
   than half way around the horizon, there were again darkness and
   silence.

        When I awaked, I was not as I had been. Upon my memory was graven
   the vision of the city, and within my soul had arisen another and
   vaguer recollection, of whose nature I was not then certain.
   Thereafter, on the cloudy nights when I could sleep, I saw the city
   often; sometimes under that horned waning moon, and sometimes under the
   hot yellow rays of a sun which did not set, but which wheeled low
   around the horizon. And on the clear nights the Pole Star leered as
   never before.

        Gradually I came to wonder what might be my place in that city on
   the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks. At first content to view the
   scene as an all-observant uncorporeal presence, I now desired to define
   my relation to it, and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who
   conversed each day in the public squares. I said to myself, "This is no
   dream, for by what means can I prove the greater reality of that other
   life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and
   the cemetery on the low hillock, where the Pole Star peers into my
   north window each night?"

        One night as I listened to the discourse in the large square
   containing many statues, I felt a change; and perceived that I had at
   last a bodily form. Nor was I a stranger in the streets of Olathoë,
   which lies on the plateau of Sarkis, betwixt the peaks Noton and
   Kadiphonek. It was my friend Alos who spoke, and his speech was one
   that pleased my soul, for it was the speech of a true man and patriot.
   That night had the news come of Daikos' fall, and of the advance of the
   Inutos; squat, hellish, yellow fiends who five years ago appeared out
   of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom, and finally
   to besiege our towns. Having taken the fortified places at the foot of
   the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every
   citizen could resist with the strength of ten men. For the squat
   creatures were mighty in the arts of war, and knew not the scruples of
   honour which held back our tall, grey-eyed men of Lomar from ruthless
   conquest.

        Alos, my friend, was commander of all the forces of the plateau,
   and in him lay the last hope of our country. On this occasion he spoke
   of the perils to be faced, and exhorted the men of Olathoë, bravest of
   the Lomarians, to sustain the traditions of their ancestors, who when
   forced to move southward from Zobna before the advance of the great
   ice-sheet (even as our descendants must some day flee from the land of
   Lomar), valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy, long-armed,
   cannibal Gnophkehs that stood in their way. To me Alos denied a
   warrior's part, for I was feeble and given to strange faintings when
   subjected to stress and hardships. But my eyes were the keenest in the
   city, despite the long hours I gave each day to the study of the
   Pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom of the Zobnarian Fathers; so my
   friend, desiring not to doom me to inaction, rewarded me with that duty
   which was second nothing in importance. To the watch-tower of Thapnen
   he sent me, there to serve as the eyes of our army. Should the Inutos
   attempt to gain the citadel by the narrow pass behind the peak Noton,
   and thereby surprise the garrison, I was to give the signal of fire
   which would warn the waiting soldiers and save the town from immediate
   disaster.

        Alone I mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed
   in the passes below. My brain was sore dazed with excitement and
   fatigue, for I had not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm, for
   I loved my native land of Lomar, and the marble city of Olathoë that
   lies betwixt the peaks of Noton and Kadiphonek.

        But as I stood in the tower's topmost chamber, I beheld the horned
   waning moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that
   hovered over the distant valley of Banof. And through an opening in the
   roof glittered the pale Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering
   like a fiend and tempter. Methought its spirit whispered evil counsel,
   soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise
   which it repeated over and over:

   "Slumber, watcher, till the spheres
   Six and twenty thousand years
   Have revolv'd, and I return
   To the spot where now I burn.
   Other stars anon shall rise
   To the axis of the skies;
   Stars that soothe and stars that bless
   With a sweet forgetfulness:
   Only when my round is o'er
   Shall the past disturb thy door."

   Vainly did I struggle with my drowsiness, seeking to connect these
   strange words with some lore of the skies which I had learnt from the
   Pnakotic manuscripts. My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast,
   and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star
   grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of
   a dream-swamp. And I am still dreaming.

        In my shame and despair I sometimes scream frantically, begging
   the dream-creatures around me to waken me ere the Inutos steal up the
   pass behind the peak Noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these
   creatures are daemons, for they laugh at me and tell me I am not
   dreaming. They mock me whilst I sleep, and whilst the squat yellow foe
   may be creeping silently upon us. I have failed in my duty and betrayed
   the marble city of Olathoë; I have proven false to Alos, my friend and
   commander. But still these shadows of my dream deride me. They say
   there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in
   those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls
   low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for
   thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures,
   blighted by the cold, whom they call "Esquimaux".

        And as I writhe in my guilty agony, frantic to save the city whose
   peril every moment grows, and vainly striving to shake off this
   unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp
   and a cemetery on a low hillock; the Pole Star, even and monstrous,
   leers down from the black vault, winking hideously like an insane
   watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls
   nothing save that it once had a message to convey.

   1807428Postcard from H. P. Lovecraft to Clark Ashton Smith, 14th
   December 1933Howard Phillips Lovecraft1933

   Well--no sooner had my epistle gone out of the house that the
   expressman brought your welcome packet--the "Geography" & the "Lady".
   Have thumbed through the pages of the former, & it looks as though it
   promises an even rarer feast than the kindred volumes I have recently
   read. Old Monty's scholarship certainly is profound to the very last
   degree. I shall be interested to see how far the "Lady" comes forward
   justifying the intemperate admiration of Comte d'Erlette & Jehvish-Ei.

   "Dark Chamber" & cuttings will go on the road as soon as I get down
   town. The weather has slightly moderated, so that I may make it today
   or tomorrow.

   This card shews a finely panelled room taken from an old house at the
   front of the hill not so very far from here. I never saw it in its
   original site, but have visited it in its present Brooklyn habitat.
   Another room from the same house is in a museum in Minneapolis,
   Minn--young Melmoth's home territory. The old brick house, stripped of
   its fine woodwork, still stands--in a neighbourhood of slowly decaying
   commercialism.

   Yrs with the blessing of Nefren-Ka-

   Ech-Pi-El

   Providence
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Written May 1924; published 26 September 1924
   9565ProvidenceH. P. Lovecraft

   Where bay and river tranquil blend,
   And leafy hillsides rise,
   The spires of Providence ascend
   Against the ancient skies,
   And in the narrow winding ways
   That climb o'er slope and crest,
   The magic of forgotten days
   May still be found to rest.
   A fanlight's gleam, a knocker's blow,
   A glimpse of Georgian brick -
   The sights and sounds of long ago
   Where fancies cluster thick.
   A flight of steps with iron rail,
   A belfry looming tall,
   A slender steeple, carved and pale,
   A moss-grown garden wall.
   A hidden churchyard's crumbling proofs
   Of man's mortality,
   A rotting wharf where gambrel roofs
   Keep watch above the sea.
   Square and parade, whose walls have towered
   Full fifteen decades long
   By cobbled ways 'mid trees embowered,
   And slighted by the throng.
   Stone bridges spanning languid streams,
   Houses perched on the hill,
   And courts where mysteries and dreams
   The brooding spirit fill.
   Steep alley steps by vines concealed,
   Where small-paned windows glow
   At twilight on a bit of field
   That chance has left below.
   My Providence! What airy hosts
   Turn still thy gilded vanes;
   What winds of elf that with grey ghosts
   People thine ancient lanes!
   The chimes of evening as of old
   Above thy valleys sound,
   While thy stern fathers 'neath the mould
   Make blest thy sacred ground.

   Psychopompos: A Tale in Rhyme
   by H.P. Lovecraft

   1336947Psychopompos: A Tale in RhymeH.P. Lovecraft

   I am He who howls in the night;
   I am He who moans in the snow;
   I am He who hath never seen light;
   I am He who mounts from below.
   My car is the car of Death;
   My wings are the wings of dread;
   My breath is the north wind's breath;
   My prey are the cold and the dead.
   In old Auvergne, when schools were poor and few,
   And peasants fancy'd what they scarcely knew,
   When lords and gentry shunn'd their Monarch's throne
   For solitary castles of their own,
   There dwelt a man of rank, whose fortress stood
   In the hush'd twilight of a hoary wood.
   De Blois his name; his lineage high and vast,
   A proud memorial of an honour'd past;
   But curious swains would whisper now and then
   That Sieur De Blois was not as other men.
   In person dark and lean, with glossy hair,
   And gleaming teeth that he would often bare,
   With piercing eye, and stealthy roving glance,
   And tongue that clipt the soft, sweet speech of France;
   The Sieur was little lov'd and seldom seen,
   So close he kept within his own demesne.
   The castle servants, few, discreet, and old,
   Full many a tale of strangeness might have told;
   But bow'd with years, they rarely left the door
   Wherein their sires and grandsires serv'd before.
   Thus gossip rose, as gossip rises best,
   When mystery imparts a keener zest;
   Seclusion oft the poison tongue attracts,
   And scandal prospers on a dearth of facts.
   'Twas said, the Sieur had more than once been spy'd
   Alone at midnight by the river's side,
   With aspect so uncouth, and gaze so strange,
   That rustics cross'd themselves to see the change;
   Yet none, when press'd, could clearly say or know
   Just what it was, or why they trembled so.
   De Blois, as rumour whisper'd, fear'd to pray,
   Nor us'd his chapel on the Sabbath day;
   Howe'er this may have been, 'twas known at least
   His household had no chaplain, monk, or priest.
   But if the Master liv'd in dubious fame,
   Twice fear'd and hated was his noble Dame;
   As dark as he, in features wild and proud,
   And with a weird supernal grace endow'd,
   The haughty mistress scorn'd the rural train
   Who sought to learn her source, but sought in vain.
   Old women call'd her eyes too bright by half,
   And nervous children shiver'd at her laugh;
   Richard, the dwarf (whose word had little weight),
   Vow'd she was like a serpent in her gait,
   Whilst ancient Pierre (the aged often err)
   Laid all her husband's mystery to her.
   Still more absurd were those odd mutter'd things
   That calumny to curious list'ners brings;
   Those subtle slanders, told with downcast face,
   And muffled voice--those tales no man may trace;
   Tales that the faith of old wives can command,
   Tho' always heard at sixth or seventh hand.
   Thus village legend darkly would imply
   That Dame De Blois possess'd an evil eye;
   Or going further, furtively suggest
   A lurking spark of sorcery in her breast;
   Old Mère Allard (herself half witch) once said
   The lady's glance work'd strangely on the dead.
   So liv'd the pair, like many another two
   That shun the crowd, and shrink from public view.
   They scorn'd the doubts by ev'ry peasant shewn,
   And ask'd but one thing--to be let alone!
   'Twas Candlemas, the dreariest time of year,
   With fall long gone, and spring too far to cheer,
   When little Jean, the bailiff's son and heir,
   Fell sick and threw the doctors in despair.
   A child so stout and strong that few would think
   An hour might carry him to death's dark brink,
   Yet pale he lay, tho' hidden was the cause,
   And Galens search'd in vain thro' Nature's laws.
   But stricken sadness could not quite suppress
   The roving thought, or wrinkled grandam's guess:
   Tho' spoke by stealth, 'twas known to half a score
   That Dame De Blois rode by the day before;
   She had (they said) with glances weird and wild
   Paus'd by the gate to view the prattling child,
   Nor did they like the smile which seem'd to trace
   New lines of evil on her proud, dark face.
   These things they whisper'd, when the mother's cry
   Told of the end--the gentle soul gone by;
   In genuine grief the kindly watcher wept,
   Whilst the lov'd babe with saints and angels slept.
   The village priest his simple rites went thro',
   And good Michel nail'd up the box of yew;
   Around the corpse the holy candles burn'd,
   The mourners sighed, the parents dumbly yearn'd.
   Then one by one each sought his humble bed,
   And left the lonely mother with her dead.
   Late in the night it was, when o'er the vale
   The storm-king swept with pandemoniac gale;
   Deep pil'd the cruel snow, yet strange to tell,
   The lightning sputter'd while the white flakes fell;
   A hideous presence seem'd abroad to steal,
   And terror sounded in the thunder's peal.
   Within the house of grief the tapers glow'd
   Whilst the poor mother bow'd beneath her load;
   Her salty eyes too tired now to weep,
   Too pain'd to see, too sad to close in sleep.
   The clock struck three, above the tempest heard,
   When something near the lifeless infant stirr'd;
   Some slipp'ry thing, that flopp'd in awkward way,
   And climb'd the table where the coffin lay;
   With scaly convolutions strove to find
   The cold, still clay that death had left behind.
   The nodding mother hears--starts broad awake--
   Empower'd to reason, yet too stunn'd to shake;
   The pois'nous thing she sees, and nimbly foils
   The ghoulish purpose of the quiv'ring coils:
   With ready axe the serpent's head she cleaves,
   And thrills with savage triumph whilst she grieves.
   The injur'd reptile hissing glides from sight,
   And hides its cloven carcass in the night.
   The weeks slipp'd by, and gossip's tongue began
   To call the Sieur De Blois an alter'd man;
   With curious mien he oft would pace along
   The village street, and eye the gaping throng.
   Yet whilst he shew'd himself as ne'er before,
   His wild-eyed lady was observ'd no more.
   In course of time, 'twas scarce thought odd or ill
   That he his ears with village lore should fill;
   Nor was the town with special rumour rife
   When he sought out the bailiff and his wife:
   Their tale of sorrow, with its ghastly end,
   Was told, indeed, by ev'ry wond'ring friend.
   The Sieur heard all, and low'ring rode away,
   Nor was he seen again for many a day.
   When vernal sunshine shed its cheering glow,
   And genial zephyrs blew away the snow,
   To frighten'd swains a horror was reveal'd
   In the damp herbage of a melting field.
   There (half preserv'd by winter's frigid bed)
   Lay the dark Dame De Blois, untimely dead;
   By some assassin's stroke most foully slain,
   Her shapely brow and temples cleft in twain.
   Reluctant hands the dismal burden bore
   To the stone arches of the husband's door,
   Where silent serfs the ghastly thing receiv'd,
   Trembling with fright, but less amaz'd than griev'd;
   The Sieur his dame beheld with blazing eyes,
   And shook with anger, more than with surprise.
   (At least 'tis thus the stupid peasants told
   Their wide-mouth'd wives when they the tale unroll'd.)
   The village wonder'd why De Blois had kept
   His spouse's loss unmention'd and unwept,
   Nor were there lacking sland'rous tongues to claim
   That the dark master was himself to blame.
   But village talk could scarcely hope to solve
   A crime so deep, and thus the months revolve:
   The rural train repeat the gruesome tale,
   And gape and marvel more than they bewail.
   Swift flew the sun, and winter once again
   With icy talons gripp'd the frigid plain.
   December brought its store of Christmas cheer,
   And grateful peasants hail'd the op'ning year;
   But by the hearth as Candlemas drew nigh,
   The whisp'ring ancients spoke of things gone by.
   Few had forgot the dark demoniac lore
   Of things that came the Candlemas before,
   And many a crone intently eyed the house
   Where dwelt the sadden'd bailiff and his spouse.
   At last the day arriv'd, the sky o'erspread
   With dark'ning messengers and clouds of lead;
   Each neighb'ring grove Aeolian warnings sigh'd,
   And thick'ning terrors broadcast seem'd to bide.
   The good folk, tho' they knew not why, would run
   Swift past the bailiff's door, the scene to shun;
   Within the house the grieving couple wept,
   And mourn'd the child who now forever slept.
   On rush'd the dusk in doubly hideous form,
   Borne on the pinions of the gath'ring storm;
   Unusual murmurs fill'd the rainless wind,
   The rising river lash'd the troubled shore;
   Black thro' the night the awful storm-god prowl'd,
   And froze the list'ners' life-blood as he howl'd;
   Gigantic trees like supple rushes sway'd,
   Whilst for his home the trembling cotter pray'd.
   Now falls a sudden lull amidst the gale;
   With less'ning force the circling currents wail;
   Far down the stream that laves the neighb'ring mead
   Burst a new ululation, wildly key'd;
   The peasant train a frantic mien assume,
   And huddle closer in the spectral gloom:
   To each strain'd ear the truth too well is known,
   For that dread sound can come from wolves alone!
   The rustics close attend, when ere they think,
   A lupine army swarms the river's brink;
   From out the waters leap a howling train
   That rend the air, and scatter o'er the plain:
   With flaming orbs the frothing creatures fly,
   And chant with hellish voice their hungry cry.
   First of the pack a mighty monster leaps
   With fearless tread, and martial order keeps;
   Th' attendant wolves his yelping tones obey,
   And form in columns for the coming fray:
   No frighten'd swain they harm, but silent bound
   With a fix'd purpose o'er the frozen ground.
   Straight course the monsters thro' the village street,
   Unholy vigour in their flying feet;
   Thro' half-shut blinds the shelter'd peasants peer,
   And wax in wonder as they lose in fear.
   Th' excited pack at last their goal perceive,
   And the vex'd air with deaf'ning clamour cleave;
   The churls, astonish'd, watch th' unnatural herd
   Flock round a cottage at the leader's word:
   Quick spreads the fearsome fact, by rumour blown,
   That the doom'd cottage is the bailiff's own!
   Round and around the howling daemons glide,
   Whilst the fierce leader scales the vine-clad side;
   The frantic wind its horrid wail renews,
   And mutters madly thro' the lifeless yews.
   In the frail house the bailiff calmly waits
   The rav'ning horde, and trusts th' impartial Fates,
   But the wan wife revives with curious mien
   Another monster and an older scene;
   Amidst th' increasing wind that rocks the walls,
   The dame to him the serpent's deed recalls:
   Then as a nameless thought fills both their minds,
   The bare-fang'd leader crashes thro' the blinds.
   Across the room, with murd'rous fury rife,
   Leaps the mad wolf, and seizes on the wife;
   With strange intent he drags his shrieking prey
   Close to the spot where once the coffin lay.
   Wilder and wilder roars the mounting gale
   That sweeps the hills and hurtles thro' the vale;
   The ill-made cottage shakes, the pack without
   Dance with new fury in demoniac rout.
   Quick as his thought, the valiant bailiff stands
   Above the wolf, a weapon in his hands;
   The ready axe that serv'd a year before,
   Now serves as well to slay one monster more.
   The creature drops inert, with shatter'd head,
   Full on the floor, and silent as the dead;
   The rescu'd wife recalls the dire alarms,
   And faints from terror in her husband's arms.
   But as he holds her, all the cottage quakes,
   And with full force the titan tempest breaks:
   Down crash the walls, and o'er their shrinking forms
   Burst the mad revels of the storm of storms.
   Th' encircling wolves advance with ghastly pace,
   Hunger and murder in each gleaming face,
   But as they close, from out the hideous night
   Flashes a bolt of unexpected light:
   The vivid scene to ev'ry eye appears,
   And peasants shiver with returning fears.
   Above the wreck the scatheless chimney stays,
   Its outline glimm'ring in the fitful rays,
   Whilst o'er the hearth still hangs the household shrine,
   The Saviour's image and the Cross divine!
   Round the blest spot a lambent radiance glows,
   And shields the cotters from their stealthy foes:
   Each monstrous creature marks the wondrous glare,
   Drops, fades, and vanishes in empty air!
   The village train with startled eyes adore,
   And count their beads in rev'rence o'er and o'er.
   Now fades the light, and dies the raging blast,
   The hour of dread and reign of horror past.
   Pallid and bruis'd, from out his toppled walls
   The panting bailiff with his good wife crawls:
   Kind hands attend them, whilst o'er all the town
   A strange sweet peace of spirit settles down.
   Wonder and fear are still'd in soothing sleep,
   As thro' the breaking clouds the moon rays peep.
   Here paus'd the prattling grandam in her speech,
   Confus'd with age, the tale half out of reach;
   The list'ning guest, impatient for a clue,
   Fears 'tis not one tale, but a blend of two;
   He fain would know how far'd the widow'd lord
   Whose eerie ways th' initial theme afford,
   And marvels that the crone so quick should slight
   His fate, to babble of the wolf-wrack'd night.
   The old wife, press'd, for greater clearness strives,
   Nods wisely, and her scatter'd wits revives;
   Yet strangely lingers on her latter tale
   Of wolf and bailiff, miracle and gale.
   When (quoth the crone) the dawn's bright radiance bath'd
   Th' eventful scene, so late in terror swath'd,
   The chatt'ring churls that sought the ruin'd cot
   Found a new marvel in the gruesome spot.
   From fallen walls a trail of gory red,
   As of the stricken wolf, erratic led;
   O'er road and mead the new-dript crimson wound,
   Till lost amidst the neighb'ring swampy ground:
   With wonder unappeas'd the peasants burn'd,
   For what the quicksand takes is ne'er return'd.
   Once more the grandam, with a knowing eye,
   Stops in her tale, to watch a hawk soar by;
   The weary list'ner, baffled, seeks anew
   For some plain statement, or enlight'ning clue.
   Th' indulgent crone attends the puzzled plea,
   Yet strangely mutters o'er the mystery.
   The Sieur? Ah, yes--that morning all in vain
   His shaking servants scour'd the frozen plain;
   No man had seen him since he rode away
   In silence on the dark preceding day.
   His horse, wild-eyed with some unusual fright,
   Came wand'ring from the river-bank that night.
   His hunting-hound, that mourn'd with piteous woe,
   Howl'd by the quicksand swamp, his grief to shew.
   The village folk thought much, but utter'd less;
   The servants' search wore out in emptiness:
   For Sieur De Blois (the old wife's tale is o'er)
   Was lost to mortal sight for evermore.

   12315RevelationH. P. Lovecraft

   In a vale of light and laughter,
   Shining 'neath the friendly sun,
   Where fulfilment follow'd after
   Ev'ry hope or dream begun;
   Where an Aidenn gay and glorious,
   Beckon'd down the winsome way;
   There my soul, o'er pain victorious,
   Laugh'd and lingered - yesterday.
   Green and narrow was my valley,
   Temper'd with a verdant shade;
   Sun deck'd brooklets musically
   Sparkled thro' each glorious glade;
   And at night the stars serenely
   Glow'd betwixt the boughs o'erhead,
   While Astarte, calm and queenly,
   Floods of fairy radiance shed.
   There amid the tinted bowers,
   Raptur'd with the opiate spell
   Of the grasses, ferns and flowers,
   Poppy, Phlox and Pimpernel,
   Long I lay, entranc'd and dreaming,
   Pleas'd with Nature's bounteous store,
   Till I mark'd the shaded gleaming
   Of the sky, and yearn'd for more.
   Eagerly the branches tearing,
   Clear'd I all the space above,
   Till the bolder gaze, high faring,
   Scann'd the naked skies of Jove;
   Deeps unguess'd now shone before me,
   Splendid beam'd the solar car;
   Wings of fervid fancy bore me
   Out beyond the farthest star.
   Reaching, gasping, wishing, longing
   For the pageant brought to sight,
   Vain I watch'd the gold orbs thronging
   Round the celestial poles of light.
   Madly on a moonbeam ladder
   Heav'ns abyss I sought to scale,
   Ever wiser, ever sadder,
   As the fruitless task would fail.
   Then, with futile striving sated,
   Veer'd my soul to earth again,
   Well content that I was fated
   For a fair, yet low domain;
   Pleasing thoughts of glad tomorrows,
   Like the blissful moments past,
   Lull'd to rest my transient sorrows,
   Stil'd my godless greed at last.
   But my downward glance, returning,
   Shrank in fright from what it spy'd;
   Slopes in hideous torment burning,
   Terror in the brooklet's tide:
   For the dell, of shade denuded
   By my desecrating hand,
   'Neath the bare sky blaz'd and brooded
   As a lost, accursed land.

   Except as otherwise provided in this title, as used in this title, the
   following terms and their variant forms mean the following:
     * An ``anonymous work'' is a work on the copies or phonorecords of
       which no natural person is identified as author.
     * An ``architectural work'' is the design of a building as embodied
       in any tangible medium of expression, including a building,
       architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall
       form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and
       elements in the design, but does not include individual standard
       features.
     * ``Audiovisual works'' are works that consist of a series of related
       images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of
       machines or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic
       equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of
       the nature of the material objects, such as films or tapes, in
       which the works are embodied.
     * The ``Berne Convention'' is the Convention for the Protection of
       Literary and Artistic Works, signed at Berne, Switzerland, on
       September 9, 1886, and all acts, protocols, and revisions thereto.
     * The ``best edition'' of a work is the edition, published in the
       United States at any time before the date of deposit, that the
       Library of Congress determines to be most suitable for its
       purposes.
     * A person's ``children'' are that person's immediate offspring,
       whether legitimate or not, and any children legally adopted by that
       person.
     * A ``collective work'' is a work, such as a periodical issue,
       anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions,
       constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
       assembled into a collective whole.
     * A ``compilation'' is a work formed by the collection and assembling
       of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated,
       or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole
       constitutes an original work of authorship. The term
       ``compilation'' includes collective works.
     * A ``computer program'' is a set of statements or instructions to be
       used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a
       certain result.
     * ``Copies'' are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which
       a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and
       from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise
       communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or
       device. The term ``copies'' includes the material object, other
       than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed.
     * A ``Copyright Royalty Judge'' is a Copyright Royalty Judge
       appointed under section 802 of this title, and includes any
       individual serving as an interim Copyright Royalty Judge under such
       section.
     * ``Copyright owner'', with respect to any one of the exclusive
       rights comprised in a copyright, refers to the owner of that
       particular right.
     * A work is ``created'' when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for
       the first time; where a work is prepared over a period of time, the
       portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time
       constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has been
       prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate
       work.
     * A ``derivative work'' is a work based upon one or more preexisting
       works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
       fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
       reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
       a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
       modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of
       authorship, is a ``derivative work''.

       work, to show individual images nonsequentially.
     * An ``establishment'' is a store, shop, or any similar place of
       business open to the general public for the primary purpose of
       selling goods or services in which the majority of the gross square
       feet of space that is nonresidential is used for that purpose, and
       in which nondramatic musical works are performed publicly.
     * A ``food service or drinking establishment'' is a restaurant, inn,
       bar, tavern, or any other similar place of business in which the
       public or patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being served
       food or drink, in which the majority of the gross square feet of
       space that is nonresidential is used for that purpose, and in which
       nondramatic musical works are performed publicly.
     * The term ``financial gain'' includes receipt, or expectation of
       receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other
       copyrighted works.
     * A work is ``fixed'' in a tangible medium of expression when its
       embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of
       the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be
       perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of
       more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images,
       or both, that are being transmitted, is ``fixed'' for purposes of
       this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously
       with its transmission.
     * The ``Geneva Phonograms Convention'' is the Convention for the
       Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized
       Duplication of Their Phonograms, concluded at Geneva, Switzerland,
       on October 29, 1971.
     * The ``gross square feet of space'' of an establishment means the
       entire interior space of that establishment, and any adjoining
       outdoor space used to serve patrons, whether on a seasonal basis or
       otherwise.

                (2) the Geneva Phonograms Convention;
                (3) the Berne Convention;

                (7) any other copyright treaty to which the United States
                is a party.

       intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or
       interdependent parts of a unitary whole.
     * ``Literary works'' are works, other than audiovisual works,
       expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols
       or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such

       group of viewers outside of a normal circle of a family and its
       social acquaintances.

       images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it
       audible.
     * A ``performing rights society'' is an association, corporation, or
       other entity that licenses the public performance of nondramatic
       musical works on behalf of copyright owners of such works, such as

     * ``Phonorecords'' are material objects in which sounds, other than
       those accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work, are
       fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which
       the sounds can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated,

       applied art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps,
       globes, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings, including
       architectural plans. Such works shall include works of artistic
       craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or
       utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article,
       as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial,
       graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that,
       such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features
       that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing
       independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.
     * For purposes of section 513, a ``proprietor'' is an individual,
       corporation, partnership, or other entity, as the case may be, that
       owns an establishment or a food service or drinking establishment,

                display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or

                the members of the public capable of receiving the
                performance or display receive it in the same place or in
                separate places and at the same time or at different
                times.

     * ``Registration'', for purposes of sections 205(c)(2), 405, 406,
       410(d), 411, 412, and 506(e), means a registration of a claim in

       agreement.
     * The ``United States'', when used in a geographical sense, comprises
       the several States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth
       of Puerto Rico, and the organized territories under the
       jurisdiction of the United States Government.
     * For purposes of section 411, a work is a ``United States work''

       her death, whether or not the spouse has later remarried.

                or, in the case of a sculpture, in multiple cast, carved,
                or fabricated sculptures of 200 or fewer that are

                the author, or in a limited edition of 200 copies or fewer
                that are signed and consecutively numbered by the author.
                A work of visual art does not include--

                      (A)(i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical
                      drawing, diagram, model, applied art, motion picture
                      or other audiovisual work, book, magazine,
                      newspaper, periodical, data base, electronic
                      information service, electronic publication, or
                      similar publication;

                            (ii) any merchandising item or advertising,

                or her employment; or
                (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a
                contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion
                picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a
                supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional
                text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an
                atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written
                instrument signed by them that the work shall be
                considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the
                foregoing sentence, a ``supplementary work'' is a work
                prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work
                by another author for the purpose of introducing,

                activities.
                In determining whether any work is eligible to be
                considered a work made for hire under paragraph (2),
                neither the amendment contained in section 1011(d) of the
                Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform
                Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public
                Law 106-113, nor the deletion of the words added by that
                amendment--

                      (A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal
                      significance, or
                      (B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional
                      approval or disapproval of, or acquiescence in, any
                      judicial determination, by the courts or the
                      Copyright Office. Paragraph (2) shall be interpreted
                      as if both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made For Hire
                      and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000 and
                      section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and
                      Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as

Sunset (Lovecraft)

   Sunset  (1918)
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   first published in the United Amateur, May 1918
   567947SunsetH. P. Lovecraft1918

   The cloudless day is richer at its close;
     A golden glory settles on the lea;
   Soft stealing shadows hint of cool repose
     To mellowing landscape, and to calming sea.
   And in that nobler, gentler, lovelier light,
     The soul to sweeter, loftier bliss inclines;
   Freed from the noonday glare, the favour'd sight
     Increasing grace in earth and sky divines.
   But ere the purest radiance crowns the green,
     Or fairest lustre fills th' expectant grove,
   The twilight thickens, and the fleeting scene
     Leaves but a hallow'd memory of love!

   This work is in the public domain in the United States because it was
   published before January 1, 1923.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The author died in 1937, so this work is also in the public domain in
   countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus
   75 years or less. This work may also be in the public domain in
   countries and areas with longer native copyright terms that apply the
   rule of the shorter term to foreign works.

   This work is in the public domain in the United States because it was
   legally published within the United States (or the United Nations
   Headquarters in New York subject to Section 7 of the United States
   Headquarters Agreement) before 1964, and copyright was not renewed.

          For Class A renewals records (books only) published between 1923
          and 1963, check the Stanford University Copyright Renewal
          Database.
          For other renewal records of publications between 1922 - 1950
          see the University of Pennsylvania copyright records scans.
          For all records since 1978, search the U.S. Copyright Office
          records.

   The author died in 1937, so this work is also in the public domain in
   countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus
   75 years or less. This work may also be in the public domain in
   countries and areas with longer native copyright terms that apply the
   rule of the shorter term to foreign works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   the 28th year. As it was not renewed, it entered the public domain on 1
   January 1956(1 January 1956).

   This posthumous work is in the public domain in countries and areas
   where the copyright terms of posthumous works are 70 years or less

                               by Percy Simple

Chapter I[edit]

                            A Simple Rustic Maid

   Ermengarde Stubbs was the beauteous blonde daughter of Hiram Stubbs, a
   poor but honest farmer-bootlegger of Hogton, Vt. Her name was
   originally Ethyl Ermengarde, but her father persuaded her to drop the
   praenomen after the passage of the 18th Amendment, averring that it
   made him thirsty by reminding him of ethyl alcohol, C[2]H[5]OH. His own
   products contained mostly methyl or wood alcohol, CH[3]OH. Ermengarde
   confessed to sixteen summers, and branded as mendacious all reports to
   the effect that she was thirty. She had large black eyes, a prominent
   Roman nose, light hair which was never dark at the roots except when
   the local drug store was short on supplies, and a beautiful but
   inexpensive complexion. She was about 5^ft 5.33...^in tall, weighed
   115.47 lbs. on her father's copy scales - also off them - and was
   adjudged most lovely by all the village swains who admired her father's
   farm and liked his liquid crops.

   Ermengarde's hand was sought in matrimony by two ardent lovers. 'Squire
   Hardman, who had a mortgage on the old home, was very rich and elderly.
   He was dark and cruelly handsome, and always rode horseback and carried
   a riding-crop. Long had he sought the radiant Ermengarde, and now his
   ardour was fanned to fever heat by a secret known to him alone - for
   upon the humble acres of Farmer Stubbs he had discovered a vein of rich
   GOLD!! "Aha!" said he, "I will win the maiden ere her parent knows of
   his unsuspected wealth, and join to my fortune a greater fortune
   still!" And so he began to call twice a week instead of once as before.

   But alas for the sinister designs of a villain - 'Squire Hardman was
   not the only suitor for the fair one. Close by the village dwelt
   another the handsome Jack Manly, whose curly yellow hair had won the
   sweet Ermengarde's affection when both were toddling youngsters at the
   village school. Jack had long been too bashful to declare his passion,
   but one day while strolling along a shady lane by the old mill with
   Ermengarde, he had found courage to utter that which was within his
   heart.

   "O light of my life," said he, "my soul is so overburdened that I must
   speak! Ermengarde, my ideal [he pronounced it i-deel!], life has become
   an empty thing without you. Beloved of my spirit, behold a suppliant
   kneeling in the dust before thee. Ermengarde - oh, Ermengarde, raise me
   to an heaven of joy and say that you will some day be mine! It is true
   that I am poor, but have I not youth and strength to fight my way to
   fame? This I can do only for you, dear Ethyl pardon me, Ermengarde - my
   only, my most precious - ' but here he paused to wipe his eyes and mop
   his brow, and the fair responded:

   "Jack - my angel - at last - I mean, this is so unexpected and quite
   unprecedented! I had never dreamed that you entertained sentiments of
   affection in connexion with one so lowly as Farmer Stubbs' child - for
   I am still but a child! Such is your natural nobility that I had feared
   - I mean thought - you would be blind to such slight charms as I
   possess, and that you would seek your fortune in the great city; there
   meeting and wedding one of those more comely damsels whose splendour we
   observe in fashion books.

   "But, Jack, since it is really I whom you adore, let us waive all
   needless circumlocution. Jack - my darling - my heart has long been
   susceptible to your manly graces. I cherish an affection for thee -
   consider me thine own and be sure to buy the ring at Perkins' hardware
   store where they have such nice imitation diamonds in the window."

   "Ermengarde, me love!"

   "Jack - my precious!"

   "My darling!"

   "My own!"

   "My Gawd!"

                                  [Curtain]

Chapter II[edit]

                      And the Villain Still Pursued Her

   But these tender passages, sacred though their fervour, did not pass
   unobserved by profane eyes; for crouched in the bushes and gritting his
   teeth was the dastardly 'Squire Hardman! When the lovers had finally
   strolled away he leapt out into the lane, viciously twirling his
   moustache and riding-crop, and kicking an unquestionably innocent cat
   who was also out strolling.

   "Curses!" he cried - Hardman, not the cat - "I am foiled in my plot to
   get the farm and the girl! But Jack Manly shall never succeed! I am a
   man of power - and we shall see!"

   Thereupon he repaired to the humble Stubbs' cottage, where he found the
   fond father in the still-cellar washing bottles under the supervision
   of the gentle wife and mother, Hannah Stubbs. Coming directly to the
   point, the villain spoke:

   "Farmer Stubbs, I cherish a tender affection of long standing for your
   lovely offspring, Ethyl Ermengarde. I am consumed with love, and wish
   her hand in matrimony. Always a man of few words, I will not descend to
   euphemism. Give me the girl or I will foreclose the mortgage and take
   the old home!"

   "But, Sir," pleaded the distracted Stubbs while his stricken spouse
   merely glowered, "I am sure the child's affections are elsewhere
   placed."

   "She must be mine!" sternly snapped the sinister 'Squire. "I will make
   her love me - none shall resist my will! Either she becomes muh wife or
   the old homestead goes!"

   And with a sneer and flick of his riding-crop 'Squire Hardman strode
   out into the night.

   Scarce had he departed, when there entered by the back door the radiant
   lovers, eager to tell the senior Stubbses of their new-found happiness.
   Imagine the universal consternation which reigned when all was known!
   Tears flowed like white ale, till suddenly Jack remembered he was the
   hero and raised his head, declaiming in appropriately virile accents:

   "Never shall the fair Ermengarde be offered up to this beast as a
   sacrifice while I live! I shall protect her - she is mine, mine, mine -
   and then some! Fear not, dear father and mother to be - I will defend
   you all! You shall have the old home still [adverb, not noun - although
   Jack was by no means out of sympathy with Stubbs' kind of farm produce]
   and I shall lead to the altar the beauteous Ermengarde, loveliest of
   her sex! To perdition with the crool 'Squire and his ill-gotten gold -
   the right shall always win, and a hero is always in the right! I will
   go to the great city and there make a fortune to save you all ere the
   mortgage fall due! Farewell, my love - I leave you now in tears, but I
   shall return to pay off the mortgage and claim you as my bride!"

   "Jack, my protector!"

   "Ermie, my sweet roll!"

   "Dearest!"

   "Darling! - and don't forget that ring at Perkins'."

   "Oh!"

   "Ah!"

                                  [Curtain]

Chapter III[edit]

                               A Dastardly Act

   But the resourceful 'Squire Hardman was not so easily to be foiled.
   Close by the village lay a disreputable settlement of unkempt shacks,
   populated by a shiftless scum who lived by thieving and other odd jobs.
   Here the devilish villain secured two accomplices - ill-favoured
   fellows who were very clearly no gentlemen. And in the night the evil
   three broke into the Stubbs cottage and abducted the fair Ermengarde,
   taking her to a wretched hovel in the settlement and placing her under
   the charge of Mother Maria, a hideous old hag. Farmer Stubbs was quite
   distracted, and would have advertised in the papers if the cost had
   been less than a cent a word for each insertion. Ermengarde was firm,
   and never wavered in her refusal to wed the villain.

   "Aha, my proud beauty," quoth he, "I have ye in me power, and sooner or
   later I will break that will of thine! Meanwhile think of your poor old
   father and mother as turned out of hearth and home and wandering
   helpless through the meadows!"

   "Oh, spare them, spare them!" said the maiden.

   "Never . . . ha ha ha ha!" leered the brute.

   And so the cruel days sped on, while all in ignorance young Jack Manly
   was seeking fame and fortune in the great city.

Chapter IV[edit]

                               Subtle Villainy

   One day as 'Squire Hardman sat in the front parlour of his expensive
   and palatial home, indulging in his favourite pastime of gnashing his
   teeth and swishing his riding-crop, a great thought came to him; and he
   cursed aloud at the statue of Satan on the onyx mantelpiece.

   "Fool that I am!" he cried. "Why did I ever waste all this trouble on
   the girl when I can get the farm by simply foreclosing? I never thought
   of that! I will let the girl go, take the farm, and be free to wed some
   fair city maid like the leading lady of that burlesque troupe which
   played last week at the Town Hall!"

   And so he went down to the settlement, apologised to Ermengarde, let
   her go home, and went home himself to plot new crimes and invent new
   modes of villainy.

   The days wore on, and the Stubbses grew very sad over the coming loss
   of their home and still but nobody seemed able to do anything about it.
   One day a party of hunters from the city chanced to stray over the old
   farm, and one of them found the gold!! Hiding his discovery from his
   companions, he feigned rattlesnake-bite and went to the Stubbs' cottage
   for aid of the usual kind. Ermengarde opened the door and saw him. He
   also saw her, and in that moment resolved to win her and the gold. "For
   my old mother's sake I must" - he cried loudly to himself. "No
   sacrifice is too great!"

Chapter V[edit]

                                The City Chap

   Algernon Reginald Jones was a polished man of the world from the great
   city, and in his sophisticated hands our poor little Ermengarde was as
   a mere child. One could almost believe that sixteen-year-old stuff.
   Algy was a fast worker, but never crude. He could have taught Hardman a
   thing or two about finesse in sheiking. Thus only a week after his
   advent to the Stubbs family circle, where he lurked like the vile
   serpent that he was, he had persuaded the heroine to elope! It was in
   the night that she went leaving a note for her parents, sniffing the
   familiar mash for the last time, and kissing the cat goodbye - touching
   stuff! On the train Algernon became sleepy and slumped down in his
   seat, allowing a paper to fall out of his pocket by accident.
   Ermengarde, taking advantage of her supposed position as a bride-elect,
   picked up the folded sheet and read its perfumed expanse - when lo! she
   almost fainted! It was a love letter from another woman!!

   "Perfidious deceiver!" she whispered at the sleeping Algernon, "so this
   is all that your boasted fidelity amounts to! I am done with you for
   all eternity!"

   So saying, she pushed him out the window and settled down for a much
   needed rest.

Chapter VI[edit]

                           Alone in the Great City

   When the noisy train pulled into the dark station at the city, poor
   helpless Ermengarde was all alone without the money to get back to
   Hogton. "Oh why," she sighed in innocent regret, "didn't I take his
   pocketbook before I pushed him out? Oh well, I should worry! He told me
   all about the city so I can easily earn enough to get home if not to
   pay off the mortgage!"

   But alas for our little heroine - work is not easy for a greenhorn to
   secure, so for a week she was forced to sleep on park benches and
   obtain food from the bread-line. Once a wily and wicked person,
   perceiving her helplessness, offered her a position as dish-washer in a
   fashionable and depraved cabaret; but our heroine was true to her
   rustic ideals and refused to work in such a gilded and glittering
   palace of frivolity - especially since she was offered only $3.00 per
   week with meals but no board. She tried to look up Jack Manly, her
   one-time lover, but he was nowhere to be found. Perchance, too, he
   would not have known her; for in her poverty she had perforce become a
   brunette again, and Jack had not beheld her in that state since school
   days. One day she found a neat but costly purse in the dark; and after
   seeing that there was not much in it, took it to the rich lady whose
   card proclaimed her ownership. Delighted beyond words at the honesty of
   this forlorn waif, the aristocratic Mrs. Van Itty adopted Ermengarde to
   replace the little one who had been stolen from her so many years ago.
   "How like my precious Maude," she sighed, as she watched the fair
   brunette return to blondeness. And so several weeks passed, with the
   old folks at home tearing their hair and the wicked 'Squire Hardman
   chuckling devilishly.

Chapter VII[edit]

                            Happy Ever Afterward

   One day the wealthy heiress Ermengarde S. Van Itty hired a new second
   assistant chauffeur. Struck by something familiar in his face, she
   looked again and gasped. Lo! it was none other than the perfidious
   Algernon Reginald Jones, whom she had pushed from a car window on that
   fateful day! He had survived - this much was almost immediately
   evident. Also, he had wed the other woman, who had run away with the
   milkman and all the money in the house. Now wholly humbled, he asked
   forgiveness of our heroine, and confided to her the whole tale of the
   gold on her father's farm. Moved beyond words, she raised his salary a
   dollar a month and resolved to gratify at last that always unquenchable
   anxiety to relieve the worry of the old folks. So one bright day
   Ermengarde motored back to Hogton and arrived at the farm just as
   'Squire Hardman was foreclosing the mortgage and ordering the old folks
   out.

   "Stay, villain!" she cried, flashing a colossal roll of bills. "You are
   foiled at last! Here is your money - now go, and never darken our
   humble door again!"

   Then followed a joyous reunion, whilst the Squire twisted his moustache
   and riding-crop in bafflement and dismay. But hark! What is this?
   Footsteps sound on the old gravel walk, and who should appear but our
   hero, Jack Manly - worn and seedy, but radiant of face. Seeking at once
   the downcast villain, he said:

   "Squire - lend me a ten-spot, will you? I have just come back from the
   city with my beauteous bride, the fair Bridget Goldstein, and need
   something to start things on the old farm." Then turning to the
   Stubbses, he apologised for his inability to pay off the mortgage as
   agreed.

   "Don't mention it," said Ermengarde, "prosperity has come to us, and I
   will consider it sufficient payment if you will forget forever the
   foolish fancies of our childhood."

   All this time Mrs. Van Itty had been sitting in the motor waiting for
   Ermengarde; but as she lazily eyed the sharp-faced Hannah Stubbs a
   vague memory started from the back of her brain. Then it all came to
   her, and she shrieked accusingly at the agrestic matron.

   "You - you - Hannah Smith - I know you now! Twenty-eight years ago you
   were my baby Maude's nurse and stole her from the cradle!! Where, oh,
   where is my child?" Then a thought came as the lightning in a murky
   sky. "Ermengarde - you say she is your daughter.... She is mine! Fate
   has restored to me my old chee-ild - my tiny Maudie! Ermengarde - Maude
   - come to your mother's loving arms!!!"

   But Ermengarde was doing some tall thinking. How could she get away
   with the sixteen-year-old stuff if she had been stolen twenty-eight
   years ago? And if she was not Stubbs' daughter the gold would never be
   hers. Mrs. Van Itty was rich, but 'Squire Hardman was richer. So,
   approaching the dejected villain, she inflicted upon him the last
   terrible punishment.

   "'Squire, dear," she murmured, "I have reconsidered all. I love you and
   your naive strength. Marry me at once or I will have you prosecuted for
   that kidnapping last year. Foreclose your mortgage and enjoy with me
   the gold your cleverness discovered. Come, dear!" And the poor dub did.

   6456The AlchemistH. P. Lovecraft

   High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are
   wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest,
   stands the old chateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty
   battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside
   about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose
   honoured line is older even than the moss-grown castle walls. These
   ancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and crumbling
   under the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of
   feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all
   France. From its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons,
   Counts, and even Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious
   halls resounded to the footstep of the invader.

   But since those glorious years all is changed. A poverty but little
   above the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that
   forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have
   prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in
   pristine splendour; and the falling stones of the walls, the overgrown
   vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill-paved
   courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the sagging floors,
   the worm-eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within, all tell a
   gloomy tale of fallen grandeur. As the ages passed, first one, then
   another of the four great turrets were left to ruin, until at last but
   a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty
   lords of the estate.

   It was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower
   that I, Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Comtes de C----,
   first saw the light of day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls,
   and amongst the dark and shadowy forests, the wild ravines and grottoes
   of the hillside below, were spent the first years of my troubled life.
   My parents I never knew. My father had been killed at the age of
   thirty-two, a month before I was born, by the fall of a stone somehow
   dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle, and my
   mother having died at my birth, my care and education devolved solely
   upon one remaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable
   intelligence, whose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only child, and
   the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was
   augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian in
   excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were
   scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the
   hill. At the time, Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon
   me because my noble birth placed me above association with such
   plebeian company. Now I know that its real object was to keep from my
   ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line, that were nightly
   told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed
   accents in the glow of their cottage hearths.

   Thus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of
   my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the
   shadow-haunted library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or
   purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes
   the sides of the hill near its foot. It was perhaps an effect of such
   surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy. Those
   studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature
   most strongly claimed my attention.

   Of my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what
   small knowledge of it I was able to gain, seemed to depress me much.
   Perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old
   preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the
   terror which I ever felt at the mention of my great house, yet as I
   grew out of childhood, I was able to piece together disconnected
   fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which had
   begun to falter in approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to
   a certain circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now
   became dimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early
   age at which all the Comtes of my line had met their end. Whilst I had
   hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of
   short-lived men, I afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths,
   and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man, who often
   spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the
   holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirty-two years.
   Upon my twenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family
   document which he said had for many generations been handed down from
   father to son, and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of
   the most startling nature, and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my
   apprehensions. At this time, my belief in the supernatural was firm and
   deep-seated, else I should have dismissed with scorn the incredible
   narrative unfolded before my eyes.

   The paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when
   the old castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable
   fortress. It told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our
   estates, a person of no small accomplishments, though little above the
   rank of peasant; by name, Michel, usually designated by the surname of
   Mauvais, the Evil, on account of his sinister reputation. He had
   studied beyond the custom of his kind, seeking such things as the
   Philosopher's Stone, or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and was reputed
   wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvais
   had one son, named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the
   hidden arts, and who had therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the
   Wizard. This pair, shunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the
   most hideous practices. Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife
   alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable disappearances
   of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these
   two. Yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one
   redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with
   fierce intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a more than
   filial affection.

   One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion
   by the vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri, the Comte. A
   searching party, headed by the frantic father, invaded the cottage of
   the sorcerers and there came upon old Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge
   and violently boiling cauldron. Without certain cause, in the
   ungoverned madness of fury and despair, the Comte laid hands on the
   aged wizard, and ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no
   more. Meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming aloud the finding of
   young Godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice,
   telling too late that poor Michel had been killed in vain. As the Comte
   and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists,
   the form of Charles Le Sorcier appeared through the trees. The excited
   chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred, yet
   he seemed at first unmoved at his father's fate. Then, slowly advancing
   to meet the Comte, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse
   that ever afterward haunted the house of C----.

   "May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line
   Survive to reach a greater age than thine!"

   spake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood, he drew
   from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw in the face
   of his father's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the
   night. The Comte died without utterance, and was buried the next day,
   but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth.
   No trace of the assassin could be found, though relentless bands of
   peasants scoured the neighboring woods and the meadow-land around the
   hill.

   Thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in
   the minds of the late Comte's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent
   cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an
   arrow whilst hunting, at the age of thirty-two, there were no thoughts
   save those of grief at his demise. But when, years afterward, the next
   young Comte, Robert by name, was found dead in a nearby field from no
   apparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had
   but lately passed his thirty-second birthday when surprised by early
   death. Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same
   fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous
   chronicle; Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy
   and virtuous lives when a little below the age of their unfortunate
   ancestor at his murder.

   That I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made
   certain to me by the words which I read. My life, previously held at
   small value, now became dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and
   deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic. Isolated
   as I was, modern science had produced no impression upon me, and I
   laboured as in the Middle Ages, as wrapt as had been old Michel and
   young Charles themselves in the acquisition of demonological and
   alchemical learning. Yet read as I might, in no manner could I account
   for the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments, I
   would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation, attributing the
   early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister Charles Le Sorcier and his
   heirs; yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known
   descendants of the alchemist, I would fall back to my occult studies,
   and once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house
   from its terrible burden. Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved. I
   should never wed, for since no other branches of my family were in
   existence, I might thus end the curse with myself.

   As I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land
   beyond. Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about
   which he had loved to wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on
   myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my
   utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the
   impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many
   of my ancestors had met. Much of my time was now occupied in the
   exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old
   chateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which
   old Pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over
   four centuries. Strange and awsome were many of the objects I
   encountered. Furniture, covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with
   the rot of long dampness met my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never
   before seen by me were spun everywhere, and huge bats flapped their
   bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom.

   Of my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful
   record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the
   library tolled off so much more of my doomed existence. At length I
   approached that time which I had so long viewed with apprehension.
   Since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before
   they reached the exact age of the Comte Henri at his end, I was every
   moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death. In what
   strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was
   resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive
   victim. With new vigour I applied myself to my examination of the old
   chateau and its contents.

   It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the
   deserted portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour
   which I felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond
   which I could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw
   breath, that I came upon the culminating event of my whole life. I had
   spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half
   ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient
   turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels,
   descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of
   confinement, or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As
   I slowly traversed the nitre-encrusted passageway at the foot of the
   last staircase, the paving became very damp, and soon I saw by the
   light of my flickering torch that a blank, water-stained wall impeded
   my journey. Turning to retrace my steps, my eye fell upon a small
   trap-door with a ring, which lay directly beneath my feet. Pausing, I
   succeeded with difficulty in raising it, whereupon there was revealed a
   black aperture, exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to
   sputter, and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of
   stone steps. As soon as the torch, which I lowered into the repellent
   depths, burned freely and steadily, I commenced my descent. The steps
   were many, and led to a narrow stone-flagged passage which I knew must
   be far underground. This passage proved of great length, and terminated
   in a massive oaken door, dripping with the moisture of the place, and
   stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it. Ceasing after a time my
   efforts in this direction, I had proceeded back some distance toward
   the steps, when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most
   profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind.
   Without warning, I heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open
   upon its rusted hinges. My immediate sensations are incapable of
   analysis. To be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had
   deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit,
   produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description. When at
   last I turned and faced the seat of the sound, my eyes must have
   started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld. There in the
   ancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a man clad
   in a skull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour. His long hair
   and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of
   incredible profusion. His forehead, high beyond the usual dimensions;
   his cheeks, deep sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles; and his hands,
   long, claw-like and gnarled, were of such a deathly, marble-like
   whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man. His figure, lean to
   the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent and almost lost
   within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But strangest of
   all were his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness; profound in
   expression of understanding, yet inhuman in degree of wickedness. These
   were now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their hatred, and rooting
   me to the spot whereon I stood. At last the figure spoke in a rumbling
   voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent
   malevolence. The language in which the discourse was clothed was that
   debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned men of the Middle
   Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works
   of the old alchemists and demonologists. The apparition spoke of the
   curse which had hovered over my house, told me of my coming end, dwelt
   on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old Michel Mauvais, and
   gloated over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told me how the
   young Charles had escaped into the night, returning in after years to
   kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which
   had been his father's at his assassination; how he had secretly
   returned to the estate and established himself, unknown, in the even
   then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous
   narrator; how he had seized Robert, son of Godfrey, in a field, forced
   poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of thirty-two,
   thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this
   point I was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of
   all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when Charles Le
   Sorcier must in the course of nature have died, for the man digressed
   into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards,
   father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles
   Le Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook
   of it eternal life and youth.

   His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible
   eyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them, but suddenly the
   fiendish glare returned, and with a shocking sound like the hissing of
   a serpent, the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of
   ending my life as had Charles Le Sorcier, six hundred years before,
   ended that of my ancestor. Prompted by some preserving instinct of
   self-defense, I broke through the spell that had hitherto held me
   immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my
   existence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the
   passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid
   scene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice
   emitted by the would-be assassin proved too much for my already shaken
   nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.

   When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind
   remembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more;
   yet curiosity overmastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of
   evil, and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to
   avenge the death of poor Michel Mauvais, and how had the curse been
   carried on through all the long centuries since the time of Charles Le
   Sorcier? The dread of years was lifted off my shoulders, for I knew
   that he whom I had felled was the source of all my danger from the
   curse; and now that I was free, I burned with the desire to learn more
   of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries, and made
   of my own youth one long-continued nightmare. Determined upon further
   exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the
   unused torch which I had with me. First of all, the new light revealed
   the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger. The
   hideous eyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I turned away and
   entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what seemed
   much like an alchemist's laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile
   of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the
   torch. It may have been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I
   was strangely affected by that which I had undergone. At the farther
   end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many
   wild ravines of the dark hillside forest. Filled with wonder, yet now
   realizing how the man had obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded
   to return. I had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with
   averted face, but as I approached the body, I seemed to hear emanating
   from it a faint sound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct.
   Aghast, I turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the
   floor.

   Then all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face
   in which they were set, opened wide with an expression which I was
   unable to interpret. The cracked lips tried to frame words which I
   could not well understand. Once I caught the name of Charles Le
   Sorcier, and again I fancied that the words "years" and "curse" issued
   from the twisted mouth. Still I was at a loss to gather the purport of
   his disconnected speech. At my evident ignorance of his meaning, the
   pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me, until, helpless as I
   saw my opponent to be, I trembled as I watched him.

   Suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised
   his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I
   remained, paralyzed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying
   breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my
   days and my nights. "Fool," he shrieked, "can you not guess my secret?
   Have you no brain whereby you may recognize the will which has through
   six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house? Have I
   not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? Know you not how the
   secret of Alchemy was solved? I tell you, it is I! I! I! that have
   lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge, FOR I AM CHARLES LE
   SORCIER!"

   The Allowable Rhyme  (1915)

          Sed ubi plira nitent in carmine, non ego paucis Offendar
          maculis. --Horace

   The poetical tendency of the present and of the preceding century has
   been divided in a manner singularly curious. One loud and conspicuous
   faction of bards, giving way to the corrupt influences of a decaying
   general culture, seems to have abandoned all the properties of
   versification and reason in its mad scramble after sensational novelty;
   whilst the other and quieter school constituting a more logical
   evolution from the poesy of the Georgian period, demands an accuracy of
   rhyme and metre unknown even to the polished artists of the age of
   Pope.

   The rational contemporary disciple of the Nine, justly ignoring the
   dissonant shrieks of the radicals, is therefore confronted with a grave
   choice of technique. May he retain the liberties of imperfect or
   "allowable" rhyming which were enjoyed by his ancestors, or must he
   conform to the new ideals of perfection evolved during the past
   century? The writer of this article is frankly an archaist in verse. He
   has not scrupled to rhyme "toss'd" with "coast", "come" with "Rome", or
   "home" with "gloom" in his very latest published efforts, thereby
   proclaiming his maintenance of the old-fashioned pets as models; but
   sound modern criticism, proceeding from Mr. Rheinhart Kleiner and from
   other sources which must needs command respect, has impelled him there
   to rehearse the question for public benefit, and particularly to
   present his own side, attempting to justify his adherence to the style
   of two centuries ago.

   The earliest English attempts at rhyming probably included words whose
   agreement is so slight that it deserves the name of mere "assonance"
   rather than that of actual rhyme. Thus in the original ballad of
   "Chevy-Chase," we encounter "King" and "within" supposedly rhymed,
   whilst in the similar "Battle of Otterbourne" we behold "long" rhymed
   with "down," "ground" with "Agurstonne," and "name" with "again". In
   the ballad of "Sir Patrick Spense," "morn" and "storm," and "deep" and
   "feet" are rhymed. But the infelicities were obviously the result not
   of artistic negligence, but of plebeian ignorance, since the old
   ballads were undoubtedly the careless products of a peasant minstrelsy.
   In Chaucer, a poet of the Court, the allowable rhyme is but
   infrequently discovered, hence we may assume that the original ideal in
   English verse was the perfect rhyming sound.

   Spenser uses allowable rhymes, giving in one of his characteristic
   stanzas the three distinct sounds of "Lord", "ador'd", and "word," all
   supposed to rhyme; but of his pronunciation we know little, and may
   justly guess that to the ears of his contemporaries the sounds were not
   conspicuously different. Ben Johnson's employment of imperfect rhyming
   was much like Spenser's; moderate, and partially to be excused on
   account of a chaotic pronunciation. The better poets of the Restoration
   were also sparing of allowable rhymes; Cowley, Waller, Marvell, and
   many others being quite regular in this respect.

   It was therefore upon a world unprepared that Samuel Butler burst forth
   with his immortal "Hudibras," whose comical familiarity of diction is
   in grotesqueness surpassed only by its clever licentiousness of
   rhyming. Butler's well-known double rhymes are of necessity forced and
   inexact, and in ordinary single rhymes he seems to have had no more
   regard for precision. "Vow'd" and "would," "talisman" and "slain,"
   "restores" and "devours" are a few specimens selected at random.

   Close after Butler came Jon Oldham, a satirist whose force and
   brilliance gained him universal praise, and whose enormous crudity both
   in rhyme and in metre was forgiven amidst the splendor of his attacks.
   Oldham was almost absolutely ungoverned by the demands of the ear, and
   perpetrated such atrocious rhymes as "heads" and "besides," "devise"
   and "this," "again" and "sin," "tool" and "foul," "end" and "design'd,"
   and even "prays" and "cause."

   The glorious Dryden, refiner and purifier of English verse, did less
   for rhyme than he did for metre. Though nowhere attaining the
   extravagances of his friend Oldham, he lent the sanction of his great
   authority to rhymes which Dr. Johnson admits are "open to objection."
   But one vast difference betwixt Dryden and his loose predecessors must
   be observed. Dryden had so far improved metrical cadence, that the
   final syllables of heroic couplets stood out in especial eminence,
   displaying and emphasizing every possible similarity of sound; that is,
   lending to sounds in the first place approximately similar, the added
   similarity caused by the new prominence of their perfectly
   corresponding positions in their respective lines.

   It were needless to dwell upon the rhetorical polish of the age
   immediately succeeding Dryden's. So far as English versification is
   concerned, Pope was the world, and all the world was Pope. Dryden had
   founded a new school of verse, but the development and ultimate
   perfections of this art remained for the sickly lad who before the age
   of twelve begged to be taken to Will's Coffee-House, that he might
   obtain a personal view of the aged Dryden, his idol and model.
   Delicately attuned to the subtlest harmonies of poetical construction,
   Alexander Pope brought English prosody to its zenith, and still stands
   alone on the heights. Yet he, exquisite master of verse that he was,
   frowned not upon imperfect rhymes, provided they were set in faultless
   metre. Though most of his allowable rhymes are merely variations in the
   breadth and nature of vowel sounds, he in one instance departs far
   enough from rigid perfection to rhyme the words "vice" and "destroys."
   Yet who can take offence? The unvarying ebb and flow of the refined
   metrical impulse conceals and condones all else.

   Every argument by which English blank verse or Spanish assonant verse
   is sustained, may with greater force be applied to the allowable rhyme.
   Metre is the real essential of poetical technique, and when two sounds
   of substantial resemblance are so placed that one follows the other in
   a certain measured relation, the normal ear cannot without cavilling
   find fault with a slight want of identity in the respective dominant
   vowels. The rhyming of a long vowel with a short one is common in all
   the Georgian poets, and when well recited cannot but be overlooked
   amidst the general flow of the verse; as, for instance, the following
   from Pope:

          But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
          His faithful dog shall bear him company.

   Of like nature is the rhyming of actually different vowels whose sounds
   are, when pronounced in animated oration, by no means dissimilar. Out
   of verse, such words as "join" and "line" are quite unlike, but Pope
   well rhymes them when he writes:

          While expletives their feeble aid do join,
          and ten low words oft creep in one dull line.

   It is the final consonantal sound in rhyming which can never vary.
   This, above all else, gives the desired similarity. Syllables which
   agree in vowels but not in the final consonants are not rhymes at all,
   but simply assonants. Yet such is the inconsistent carelessness of the
   average modern writer, that he often uses mere assonants to a greater
   extent than his fathers ever employed actually allowable rhymes. The
   writer, in his critical duties, has more than once been forced to point
   out the attempted rhyming of such words as "fame" and "lane," "task"
   and "glass," or "feels" and "yields" and in view of these impossible
   combinations he cannot blame himself very seriously for rhyming "art"
   and "shot" in the March Conservative; for this pair of words have at
   least identical consonants at the end.

   That allowable rhymes have real advantages of a positive sort is an
   opinion by no means lightly to be denied. The monotony of a long heroic
   poem may often be pleasantly relieved by judicious interruptions in the
   perfect successions of rhymes, just as the metre may sometimes be
   adorned with occasional triplets and Alexandrines. Another advantage is
   the greater latitude allowed for the expression of thought. How
   numerous are the writers who, from restriction to perfect rhyming, are
   frequently compelled to abandon a neat epigram, or brilliant
   antithesis, which allowable rhyme would easily permit, or else to
   introduce a dull expletive merely to supply a desired rhyme!

   But a return to historical considerations shows us only too clearly the
   logical trend of taste, and the reason Mr. Kleiner's demand for
   absolute perfection is no idle cry. In Oliver Goldsmith there arose one
   who, though retaining the familiar classical diction of Pope, yet
   advanced further still toward what he deemed ideal polish by virtually
   abandoning the allowable rhyme. In unvaried exactitude run the couplets
   of "The Traveler" and of "The Deserted Village," and none can deny to
   them a certain urbanity which pleases the critical ear. With but little
   less precision are molded the simple rhymes of Cowper, whilst the
   pompous Erasmus Darwin likewise shows more attention to identity of
   sound than do the Queen Anne Bards. Gifford's translations of Juvenal
   and Persius show to an almost equal degree the tendency of the age, and
   Campbell, Crabbe, Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, and Thomas Moore are all
   inclined to refrain from the liberties practiced by those of former
   times. To deny the importance of such a widespread change of technique
   is fruitless, for its existence argues for its naturalness. The best
   critics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demand perfect
   rhyming, and no aspirant for fame can afford to depart from a standard
   so universal. It is evidently the true goal of the English, as well as
   of the French bard; the goal from which we are but temporarily
   deflected during the preceding age.

   But exceptions should and must be made in the case of a few who have
   somehow absorbed the atmosphere of other days, and who long in their
   hearts for the stately sound of the old classic cadences. Well may
   their predilection for imperfect rhyming be discouraged to a limited
   extent, but to chain them wholly to modern rules would be barbarous.
   Every limited mind demands a certain freedom of expression, and the man
   who cannot express himself satisfactorily without the stimulation
   derived from the spirited mode of two centuries ago should certainly be
   permitted to follow without undue restraint a practice so harmless, so
   free from essential error, and so sanctioned by precedent, as that of
   employing in his poetical compositions the smooth and inoffensive
   allowable rhyme.

   There was no hand to hold me back
   That night I found the ancient track
   Over the hill and strained to see
   The fields that teased my memory.
   This tree that wall - I knew them well,
   And all the roofs and orchards fell
   Familiarly upon my mind
   As from a past not far behind.
   I knew what shadows would be cast
   As the late moon came up at last
   From back of Zaman's Hill, and how
   The vale would shine three hours from now.
   And when the path grew steep and high
   , And seemed to end against the sky,
   I had no fear of what might rest
   Beyond that silhouetted crest.
   Straight on I walked, while all the night
   Grew pale with phosphorescent light,
   And wall and farmhouse gable glowed
   Unearthly by the climbing road.
   There was the milestone that I knew
   -"Two miles to Dunwich" - now the view
   Of distant spire and roofs would dawn
   With ten more upward paces gone...

   The was no hand to hold me back
   That night I found the ancient track,
   And reached the crest to see outspread
   A valley of the lost and dead;
   And over Zaman's Hill the horn
   Of a malignant moon was born,
   To light the weeds and vines that grew
   On ruined walls I never knew.
   The fox-fire glowed in field and bog
   And unknown waters spewed a fog
   Whose curling talons mocked the thought
   That I had ever known this spot.
   Too well I saw from the mad scene
   That my loved past had never been -
   Nor was I now upon the trail
   Descending to that long dead vale.
   Around was fog - ahead, the spray
   Of star-streams in the Milky Way...
   There was no hand to hold me back
   That night I found the ancient track.

   The Battle That Ended the Century  (1934)
   by Howard Phillips Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   This was sent anonymously to members of the "Lovecraft Circle" (friends
   and correspondants of H. P. Lovecraft, it contains pseudonymous
   references to them) in mid-1934. Lovecraft denied writing this piece,
   although he was belived to be at least one of the authors by August
   Derleth, Clark Ashton Smith and others.
   227476The Battle That Ended the CenturyHoward Phillips Lovecraft1934

   On the eve of the year 2001 a vast crowd of interested spectators were
   present amidst the romantic ruins of Cohen's Garage, on the former site
   of New York, to witness a fistic encounter between two renowned
   champions of the strange-story firmament--Two-Gun Bob^[1], the Terror
   of the Plains, and Knockout Bernie^[2], the Wild Wolf of West Shokan.
   [The Wolf was fresh from his correspondence course in physical
   training, sold to him by Mr. Arthur Leeds.] Before the battle the
   auguries were determined by the venerated Thibetan Lama Bill Lum
   Li,^[3] who evoked the primal serpent-god of Valusia and found
   unmistakable signs of victory for both sides. Cream-puffs were
   inattentively vended by Wladislaw Brenryk^[4]--the partakers being
   treated by the official surgeons, Drs. D. H. Killer^[5] and M. Gin
   Brewery.^[6]

   The gong was sounded at 39 o'clock, after which the air grew red with
   the gore of battle, lavishly flung about by the mighty Texas
   slaughterer. Very shortly the first actual damage occurred--the
   loosening of several teeth in both participants. One, bouncing out from
   the Wolf's mouth after a casual tap from Two-Gun, described a parabola
   toward Yucatan; being retrieved in a hasty expedition by Messrs. A.
   Hijacked Barrell^[7] and G. A. Scotland.^[8] This incident was used by
   the eminent sociologist and ex-poet Frank Chimesleep Short, Jr.,^[9] as
   the basis of a ballad of proletarian propaganda with three
   intentionally defective lines. Meanwhile a potentate from a
   neighbouring kingdom, the Effjay of Akkamin^[10] (also known to himself
   as an amateur critic), expressed his frenzied disgust at the technique
   of the combatants, at the same time peddling photographs of the
   fighters (with himself in the foreground) at five cents each.

   In round two the Shokan Soaker's sturdy right crashed through the
   Texan's ribs and became entangled in sundry viscera; thereby enabling
   Two Gun to get in several telling blows on his opponent's unprotected
   chin. Bob was greatly annoyed by the effeminate squeamishness shewn by
   several onlookers as muscles, glands, gore, and bits of flesh were
   spattered over the ringside. During this round the eminent
   magazine-cover anatomist Mrs. M. Blunderage^[11] portrayed the battlers
   as a pair of spirited nudes behind a thin veil of conveniently curling
   tobacco-smoke, while the late Mr. C. HalfCent^[12] provided a sketch of
   three Chinamen clad in silk hats and galoshes--this being his own
   original conception of the affray. Among the amateur sketches made was
   one by Mr. Goofy Hooey, which later gained fame in the annual Cubist
   exhibit as "Abstraction of an Eradicated Pudding".

   In the third round the fight grew really rough; several ears and other
   appurtenances being wholly or partially detached from the frontier
   battler by the Shokan Shocker. Somewhat irritated, Two-Gun countered
   with some exceptionally sharp blows; severing many fragments from his
   aggressor, who continued to fight with all his remaining members. [At
   this stage the audience gave signs of much nervous
   excitement--instances of trampling and goring being frequent. The more
   enthusiastic members were placed in the custody of Mr. Harry Brobst of
   the Butler Hospital for Mental Diseases.]

   The entire affair was reported by Mr. W. Lablache Talcum,^[13] his copy
   being revised by Horse Power Hateart^[14]. Throughout the event notes
   were taken by M. le Comte d'Erlette^[15] for a 200-volume novel-cycle
   in the Proustian manner, to be entitled Morning in September, with
   illustrations by Mrs. Blunderage. Mr. J. Caesar Warts^[16] frequently
   interviewed both battlers and all the more important spectators;
   obtaining as souvenirs (after a spirited struggle with the Effjay) an
   autographed quarter-rib of Two-Gun's, in an excellent state of
   preservation, and three finger-nails from the Wild Wolf. Lighting
   effects were supplied by the Electrical Testing Laboratories under the
   supervision of H. Kanebrake.^[17] The fourth round was prolonged eight
   hours at the request of the official artist, Mr. H. Wanderer,^[18] who
   wished to put certain shadings of fantasy into his representation of
   the Wolf's depleted physiognomy, which included several supernumerary
   details supplied by the imagination.

   The climax came in round five, when the Texas Tearer's left passed
   entirely through Battling Bernie's face and brought both sluggers to
   the mat. This was adjudged a finish by the referee--Robertieff
   Essovitch Karovsky,^[19] the Muscovite Ambassador--who, in view of the
   Shokan Shocker's gory state, declared the latter to be essentially
   liquidated according to the Marxian ideology. The Wild Wolf entered an
   official protest, which was promptly overruled on the ground that all
   the points necessary to technical death were theoretically present.

   The gonfalons sounded a fanfare of triumph for the victor, while the
   technically vanquished was committed to the care of the official
   mortician, Mr. Teaberry Quince.^[20] During the ceremonies the
   theoretical corpse strolled away for a bite of bologna, but a tasteful
   cenotaph was supplied to furnish a focus for the rites. The funeral
   procession was headed by a gaily bedecked hearse driven by Malik Taus,
   the Peacock Sultan,^[21] who sat on the box in West Point uniform and
   turban, and steered an expert course over several formidable hedges and
   stone walls. About half way to the cemetery the cortege was rejoined by
   the corpse, who sat beside Sultan Malik on the box and finished his
   bologna sandwich--his ample girth having made it impossible to enter
   the hastily selected cenotaph. An appropriate dirge was rendered by
   Maestro Sing Lee Bawledout^[22] on the piccolo; Messrs. De Silva,
   Brown, and Henderson's celebrated aria, "Never Swat a Fly", from the
   old cantata Just Imagine, being chosen for the occasion. The only
   detail omitted from the funeral was the interment, which was
   interrupted by the disconcerting news that the official gate-taker--the
   celebrated financier and publisher Ivar K. Rodent, Esq.^[23]--had
   absconded with the entire proceeds. [This omission was regretted
   chiefly by the Rev. D. Vest Wind, who was thereby forced to leave
   unspoken a long and moving sermon revised expressly for the celebration
   from a former discourse delivered at the burial of a favourite horse.]

   Mr. Talcum's report of the event, illustrated by the well-known artist
   Klarkash-Ton^[24] (who esoterically depicted the fighters as boneless
   fungi), was printed after repeated rejections by the discriminating
   editor of the Windy City Grab-Bag^[25]--as a broadside by W. Peter
   Chef^[26] [, with typographical supervision by Vrest Orton.]. This,
   through the efforts of Otis Adelbert Kline,^[27] was finally placed on
   sale in the bookshop of Smearum & Weep, three and a half copies finally
   being disposed of through the alluring catalogue description supplied
   by Samuelus Philanthropus, Esq.^[28]

   In response to this wide demand, the text was finally reprinted by Mr.
   De Merit^[29] in the polychromatic pages of Wurst's Weakly
   Americana^[30] under the title "Has Science Been Outmoded? or, The
   Millers in the Garage". No copies, however, remain in circulation;
   since all which were not snapped up by fanatical bibliophiles were
   seized by the police in connexion with the libel suit of the Wild Wolf,
   who was, after several appeals ending with the World Court, adjudged
   not only officially alive but the clear winner of the combat.

   6459The Beast in the CaveH. P. Lovecraft

   The horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon
   my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty. I was lost,
   completely, hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the
   Mammoth Cave. Turn as I might, in no direction could my straining
   vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me
   on the outward path. That nevermore should I behold the blessed light
   of day, or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world
   outside, my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief.
   Hope had departed. Yet, indoctrinated as I was by a life of
   philosophical study, I derived no small measure of satisfaction from my
   unimpassioned demeanour; for although I had frequently read of the wild
   frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations, I
   experienced none of these, but stood quiet as soon as I clearly
   realised the loss of my bearings.
         Nor did the thought that I had probably wandered beyond the
   utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure
   even for a moment. If I must die, I reflected, then was this terrible
   yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard
   might afford, a conception which carried with it more of tranquillity
   than of despair.
         Starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this I was certain.
   Some, I knew, had gone mad under circumstances such as these, but I
   felt that this end would not be mine. My disaster was the result of no
   fault save my own, since unknown to the guide I had separated myself
   from the regular party of sightseers; and, wandering for over an hour
   in forbidden avenues of the cave, had found myself unable to retrace
   the devious windings which I had pursued since forsaking my companions.
         Already my torch had begun to expire; soon I would be enveloped
   by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth.
   As I stood in the waning, unsteady light, I idly wondered over the
   exact circumstances of my coming end. I remembered the accounts which I
   had heard of the colony of consumptives, who, taking their residence in
   this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air
   of the underground world, with its steady, uniform temperature, pure
   air, and peaceful quiet, had found, instead, death in strange and
   ghastly form. I had seen the sad remains of their ill-made cottages as
   I passed them by with the party, and had wondered what unnatural
   influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert
   upon one as healthy and vigorous as I. Now, I grimly told myself, my
   opportunity for settling this point had arrived, provided that want of
   food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life.
         As the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity, I
   resolved to leave no stone unturned, no possible means of escape
   neglected; so, summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs, I set up
   a series of loud shoutings, in the vain hope of attracting the
   attention of the guide by my clamour. Yet, as I called, I believed in
   my heart that my cries were to no purpose, and that my voice, magnified
   and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me,
   fell upon no ears save my own.
         All at once, however, my attention was fixed with a start as I
   fancied that I heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky
   floor of the cavern.
         Was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon? Had, then,
   all my horrible apprehensions been for naught, and was the guide,
   having marked my unwarranted absence from the party, following my
   course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth? Whilst these
   joyful queries arose in my brain, I was on the point of renewing my
   cries, in order that my discovery might come the sooner, when in an
   instant my delight was turned to horror as I listened; for my ever
   acute ear, now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence
   of the cave, bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and
   dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were not like those of any
   mortal man. In the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region, the
   tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and
   incisive blows. These impacts were soft, and stealthy, as of the paws
   of some feline. Besides, when I listened carefully, I seemed to trace
   the falls of four instead of two feet.
         I was now convinced that I had by my own cries aroused and
   attracted some wild beast, perhaps a mountain lion which had
   accidentally strayed within the cave. Perhaps, I considered, the
   Almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that
   of hunger; yet the instinct of self-preservation, never wholly dormant,
   was stirred in my breast, and though escape from the on-coming peril
   might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end, I determined
   nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as I could
   command. Strange as it may seem, my mind conceived of no intent on the
   part of the visitor save that of hostility. Accordingly, I became very
   quiet, in the hope that the unknown beast would, in the absence of a
   guiding sound, lose its direction as had I, and thus pass me by. But
   this hope was not destined for realisation, for the strange footfalls
   steadily advanced, the animal evidently having obtained my scent, which
   in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as
   is that of the cave, could doubtless be followed at great distance.
         Seeing therefore that I must be armed for defense against an
   uncanny and unseen attack in the dark, I groped about me the largest of
   the fragments of rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of
   the cavern in the vicinity, and grasping one in each hand for immediate
   use, awaited with resignation the inevitable result. Meanwhile the
   hideous pattering of the paws drew near. Certainly, the conduct of the
   creature was exceedingly strange. Most of the time, the tread seemed to
   be that of a quadruped, walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt
   hind and fore feet, yet at brief and infrequent intervals I fancied
   that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion. I wondered
   what species of animal was to confront me; it must, I thought, be some
   unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of
   the entrances of the fearful grotto with a life-long confinement in its
   interminable recesses. It doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish,
   bats and rats of the cave, as well as some of the ordinary fish that
   are wafted in at every freshet of Green River, which communicates in
   some occult manner with the waters of the cave. I occupied my terrible
   vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alteration cave life might
   have wrought in the physical structure of the beast, remembering the
   awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who
   had died after long residence in the cave. Then I remembered with a
   start that, even should I succeed in felling my antagonist, I should
   never behold its form, as my torch had long since been extinct, and I
   was entirely unprovided with matches. The tension on my brain now
   became frightful. My disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome
   shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me, and that actually
   seemed to press upon my body. Nearer, nearer, the dreadful footfalls
   approached. It seemed that I must give vent to a piercing scream, yet
   had I been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing, my voice
   could scarce have responded. I was petrified, rooted to the spot. I
   doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the
   oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive. Now the steady
   pat, pat, of the steps was close at hand; now very close. I could hear
   the laboured breathing of the animal, and terror-struck as I was, I
   realised that it must have come from a considerable distance, and was
   correspondingly fatigued. Suddenly the spell broke. My right hand,
   guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing, threw with full force
   the sharp-angled bit of limestone which it contained, toward that point
   in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering, and,
   wonderful to relate, it nearly reached its goal, for I heard the thing
   jump, landing at a distance away, where it seemed to pause.
         Having readjusted my aim, I discharged my second missile, this
   time most effectively, for with a flood of joy I listened as the
   creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently
   remained prone and unmoving. Almost overpowered by the great relief
   which rushed over me, I reeled back against the wall. The breathing
   continued, in heavy, gasping inhalations and expirations, whence I
   realised that I had no more than wounded the creature. And now all
   desire to examine the thing ceased. At last something allied to
   groundless, superstitious fear had entered my brain, and I did not
   approach the body, nor did I continue to cast stones at it in order to
   complete the extinction of its life. Instead, I ran at full speed in
   what was, as nearly as I could estimate in my frenzied condition, the
   direction from which I had come. Suddenly I heard a sound or rather, a
   regular succession of sounds. In another instant they had resolved
   themselves into a series of sharp, metallic clicks. This time there was
   no doubt. It was the guide. And then I shouted, yelled, screamed, even
   shrieked with joy as I beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and
   glimmering effulgence which I knew to be the reflected light of an
   approaching torch. I ran to meet the flare, and before I could
   completely understand what had occurred, was lying upon the ground at
   the feet of the guide, embracing his boots and gibbering, despite my
   boasted reserve, in a most meaningless and idiotic manner, pouring out
   my terrible story, and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with
   protestations of gratitude. At length, I awoke to something like my
   normal consciousness. The guide had noted my absence upon the arrival
   of the party at the entrance of the cave, and had, from his own
   intuitive sense of direction, proceeded to make a thorough canvass of
   by-passages just ahead of where he had last spoken to me, locating my
   whereabouts after a quest of about four hours.
         By the time he had related this to me, I, emboldened by his torch
   and his company, began to reflect upon the strange beast which I had
   wounded but a short distance back in the darkness, and suggested that
   we ascertain, by the flashlight's aid, what manner of creature was my
   victim. Accordingly I retraced my steps, this time with a courage born
   of companionship, to the scene of my terrible experience. Soon we
   descried a white object upon the floor, an object whiter even than the
   gleaming limestone itself. Cautiously advancing, we gave vent to a
   simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment, for of all the unnatural
   monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld, this was in
   surpassing degree the strangest. It appeared to be an anthropoid ape of
   large proportions, escaped, perhaps, from some itinerant menagerie. Its
   hair was snow-white, a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a
   long existence within the inky confines of the cave, but it was also
   surprisingly thin, being indeed largely absent save on the head, where
   it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in
   considerable profusion. The face was turned away from us, as the
   creature lay almost directly upon it. The inclination of the limbs was
   very singular, explaining, however, the alternation in their use which
   I had before noted, whereby the beast used sometimes all four, and on
   other occasions but two for its progress. From the tips of the fingers
   or toes, long rat-like claws extended. The hands or feet were not
   prehensile, a fact that I ascribed to that long residence in the cave
   which, as I before mentioned, seemed evident from the all-pervading and
   almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy. No
   tail seemed to be present.
         The respiration had now grown very feeble, and the guide had
   drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature,
   when a sudden sound emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall
   unused. The sound was of a nature difficult to describe. It was not
   like the normal note of any known species of simian, and I wonder if
   this unnatural quality were not the result of a long continued and
   complete silence, broken by the sensations produced by the advent of
   the light, a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first
   entrance into the cave. The sound, which I might feebly attempt to
   classify as a kind of deep-tone chattering, was faintly continued.
         All at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the
   frame of the beast. The paws went through a convulsive motion, and the
   limbs contracted. With a jerk, the white body rolled over so that its
   face was turned in our direction. For a moment I was so struck with
   horror at the eyes thus revealed that I noted nothing else. They were
   black, those eyes, deep jetty black, in hideous contrast to the
   snow-white hair and flesh. Like those of other cave denizens, they were
   deeply sunken in their orbits, and were entirely destitute of iris. As
   I looked more closely, I saw that they were set in a face less
   prognathous than that of the average ape, and infinitely less hairy.
   The nose was quite distinct. As we gazed upon the uncanny sight
   presented to our vision, the thick lips opened, and several sounds
   issued from them, after which the thing relaxed in death.
         The guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that
   the light shook fitfully, casting weird moving shadows on the walls.
         I made no motion, but stood rigidly still, my horrified eyes
   fixed upon the floor ahead.
         The fear left, and wonder, awe, compassion, and reverence
   succeeded in its place, for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure
   that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth.
   The creature I had killed, the strange beast of the unfathomed cave,
   was, or had at one time been a man!

   The Book
   by H.P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   The Book is an unfinished short story by American horror fiction writer
     H. P. Lovecraft, believed to have been written in late 1933. It was
   first published in the journal Leaves in 1938, after Lovecraft's death.

   6461The BookH.P. Lovecraft

   My memories are very confused. There is even much doubt as to where
   they begin; for at times I feel appalling vistas of years stretching
   behind me, while at other times it seems as if the present moment were
   an isolated point in a grey, formless infinity. I am not even certain
   how I am communicating this message. While I know I am speaking, I have
   a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation
   will be needed to bear what I say to the points where I wish to be
   heard. My identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy. I seem to have
   suffered a great shock--perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth
   of my cycles of unique, incredible experience.
         These cycles of experience, of course, all stem from that
   worm-riddled book. I remember when I found it--in a dimly lighted place
   near the black, oily river where the mists always swirl. That place was
   very old, and the ceiling-high shelves full of rotting volumes reached
   back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves. There were,
   besides, great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins;
   and it was in one of these heaps that I found the thing. I never
   learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open
   toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses
   reeling.
         There was a formula--a sort of list of things to say and
   do--which I recognized as something black and forbidden; something
   which I had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence
   and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the
   universe's guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb. It
   was a key--a guide--to certain gateways and transitions of which
   mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which
   lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms
   of life and matter that we know. Not for centuries had any man recalled
   its vital substance or known where to find it, but this book was very
   old indeed. No printing-press, but the hand of some half-crazed monk,
   had traced these ominous Latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity.
         I remember how the old man leered and tittered, and made a
   curious sign with his hand when I bore it away. He had refused to take
   pay for it, and only long afterwards did I guess why. As I hurried home
   through those narrow, winding, mist-cloaked waterfront streets I had a
   frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding
   feet. The centuried, tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a
   fresh and morbid malignity--as if some hitherto closed channel of evil
   understanding had abruptly been opened. I felt that those walls and
   over-hanging gables of mildewed brick and fungoid plaster and
   timber--with eyelike, diamond-paned windows that leered--could hardly
   desist from advancing and crushing me...yet I had read only the least
   fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing
   it away.
         I remember how I read the book at last--white-faced, and locked
   in the attic room that I had long devoted to strange searchings. The
   great house was very still, for I had not gone up till after midnight.
   I think I had a family then--though the details are very uncertain--and
   I know there were many servants. Just what the year was I cannot say;
   for since then I have known many ages and dimensions, and have had all
   my notions of time dissolved and refashioned. It was by the light of
   candles that I read--I recall the relentless dripping of the wax--and
   there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries. I
   seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if
   I feared to hear some very remote, intruding note among them.
         Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window
   that looked out high above the other roofs of the city. It came as I
   droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay, and I knew amidst my
   shudders what it meant. For he who passes the gateways always wins a
   shadow, and never again can he be alone. I had evoked--and the book was
   indeed all I had suspected. That night I passed the gateway to a vortex
   of twisted time and vision, and when morning found me in the attic room
   I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which I had never seen
   before.
         Nor could I ever after see the world as I had known it. Mixed
   with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of
   the future, and every once-familiar object loomed alien in the new
   perspective brought by my widened sight. From then on I walked in a
   fantastic dream of unknown and half-known shapes; and with each new
   gateway crossed, the less plainly could I recognise the things of the
   narrow sphere to which I had so long been bound. What I saw about me,
   none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought
   mad. Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which
   never left my side. But still I read more--in hidden, forgotten books
   and scrolls to which my new vision led me--and pushed through fresh
   gateways of space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the
   unknown cosmos.
         I remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire
   on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous
   litany the messenger from Tartary had brought. The walls melted away,
   and I was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with
   the needle-like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me. After a
   while there was utter blackness, and then the light of myriad stars
   forming strange, alien constellations. Finally I saw a green-litten
   plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city
   built in no fashion I had ever known or read or dreamed of. As I
   floated closer to that city I saw a great square building of stone in
   an open space, and felt a hideous fear clutching at me. I screamed and
   struggled, and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled
   flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor. In that night's
   wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former
   night's wandering; but there was more of terror because I knew I was
   closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than I had ever been before.
   Thereafter I was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish
   to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence
   I could never return...

   12044The Bride of the SeaH. P. Lovecraft

   Black loom the crags of the uplands behind me,
   Dark are the sands of the far-stretching shore.
   Dim are the pathways and rocks that remind me
   Sadly of years in the lost Nevermore.

   Soft laps the ocean on wave-polish'd boulder,
   Sweet is the sound and familiar to me;
   Here, with her head gently bent to my shoulder,
   Walk'd I with Unda, the Bride of the Sea.

   Bright was the morn of my youth when I met her,
   Sweet as the breeze that blew o'er the brine.
   Swift was I captur'd in Love's strongest fetter,
   Glad to be here, and she glad to be mine.

   Never a question ask'd I where she wander'd,
   Never a question ask'd she of my birth:
   Happy as children, we thought not nor ponder'd,
   Glad of the bounty of ocean and earth.

   Once when the moonlight play'd soft 'mid the billows,
   High on the cliff o'er the waters we stood,
   Bound was her hair with a garland of willows,
   Pluck'd by the fount in the bird-haunted wood.

   Strangely she gaz'd on the surges beneath her,
   Charm'd with the sound or entranc'd by the light:
   Then did the waves a wild aspect bequeath her,
   Stern as the ocean and weird as the night.

   Coldly she left me, astonish'd and weeping,
   Standing alone 'mid the legions she bless'd:
   Down, ever downward, half gliding, half creeping,
   Stole the sweet Unda in oceanward quest.

   Calm grew the sea, and tumultuous beating
   Turn'd to a ripple as Unda the fair
   Trod the wet sands in affectionate greeting,
   Beckon'd to me, and no longer was there!

   Long did I pace by the banks where she vanish'd,
   High climb'd the moon and descended again.
   Grey broke the dawn till the sad night was banish'd,
   Still ach'd my soul with its infinite pain.

   All the wide world have I search'd for my darling;
   Scour'd the far desert and sail'd distant seas.
   Once on the wave while the tempest was snarling,
   Flash'd a fair face that brought quiet and ease.

   Ever in restlessness onward I stumble
   Seeking and pining scarce heeding my way.
   Now have I stray'd where the wide waters rumble,
   Back to the scene of the lost yesterday.

   Lo! the red moon from the ocean's low hazes
   Rises in ominous grandeur to view;
   Strange is its face as my tortur'd eye gazes
   O'er the vast reaches of sparkle and blue.

   Straight from the moon to the shore where I'm sighing
   Grows a bright bridge made of wavelets and beams.
   Frail it may be, yet how simple the trying,
   Wand'ring from earth to the orb of sweet dreams.

   What is yon face in the moonlight appearing;
   Have I at last found the maiden that fled?
   Out on the beam-bridge my footsteps are nearing
   Her whose sweet beckoning hastens my tread.

   Current's surround me, and drowsily swaying,
   Far on the moon-path I seek the sweet face.
   Eagerly, hasting, half panting, half praying,
   Forward I reach for the vision of grace.

   Murmuring waters about me are closing,
   Soft the sweet vision advances to me.
   Done are my trials; my heart is reposing
   Safe with my Unda, the Bride of the Sea.

   The Call of Cthulhu

   by H. P. Lovecraft

   (Found Among the Papers of the Late Francis Wayland Thurston, of
   Boston)

     Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a
     survival... a survival of a hugely remote period when...
     consciousness was manifested, perhaps, in shapes and forms long
     since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity... forms of
     which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called
     them gods, monsters, mythical beings of all sorts and kinds...

   The Cats
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   14867The CatsH. P. Lovecraft

   Babels of blocks to the high heavens towering
   Flames of futility swirling below;
   Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flowering,
   Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.

   Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,
   Cobwebs of cable to nameless things spun;
   Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers
   Streams of live foetor that rots in the sun.

   Colour and splendour, disease and decaying,
   Shrieking and ringing and crawling insane,
   Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying,
   Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain.

   Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal.
   Howling and lean in the glare of the moon,
   Screaming the future with mouthings infernal,
   Yelling the Garden of Pluto's red rune.

   Tall towers and pyramids ivy'd and crumbling,
   Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber'd streets;
   Bleak Arkham bridges o'er rivers whose rumbling
   Joins with no voice as the thick horde retreats.

   Belfries that buckle against the moon totter,
   Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac'd,
   And living to answer the wind and the water,
   Only the lean cats that howl in the wastes.

   254The Cats of UltharH.P. Lovecraft

   It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may
   kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who
   sitteth purring before the fire. For the cat is cryptic, and close to
   strange things which men cannot see. He is the soul of antique
   Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroe and Ophir.
   He is the kin of the jungle's lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary
   and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her
   language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that
   which she hath forgotten.
         In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats,
   there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay
   the cats of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not; save that
   many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats
   should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever
   the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and
   slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the
   sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of
   slaying was exceedingly peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss
   such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual
   expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage
   was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a
   neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd
   folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal
   assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should
   stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When through some
   unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark,
   the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by thanking Fate
   that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished. For the
   people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats first
   came.
         One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered the
   narrow cobbled streets of Ulthar. Dark wanderers they were, and unlike
   the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year.
   In the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads
   from the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could
   tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that
   they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with
   human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams and lions. And the
   leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious
   disk betwixt the horns.
         There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or
   mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not
   been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate
   his sorrow; and when one is very young, one can find great relief in
   the lively antics of a black kitten. So the boy whom the dark people
   called Menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his
   graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon.
         On the third morning of the wanderers' stay in Ulthar, Menes
   could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place
   certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds
   heard in the night. And when he heard these things his sobbing gave
   place to meditation, and finally to prayer. He stretched out his arms
   toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand;
   though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, since
   their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the
   clouds were assuming. It was very peculiar, but as the little boy
   uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy,
   nebulous figures of exotic things; of hybrid creatures crowned with
   horn-flanked disks. Nature is full of such illusions to impress the
   imaginative.
         That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again.
   And the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the
   village there was not a cat to be found. From each hearth the familiar
   cat had vanished; cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow
   and white. Old Kranon, the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had
   taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of Menes' kitten; and
   cursed the caravan and the little boy. But Nith, the lean notary,
   declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to
   suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold.
   Still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little
   Atal, the innkeeper's son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the
   cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very
   slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if
   in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts. The villagers did not
   know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared
   that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred
   not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and
   repellent yard.
         So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people
   awakened at dawn--behold! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth!
   Large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow and white, none was
   missing. Very sleek and fat did the cats appear, and sonorous with
   purring content. The citizens talked with one another of the affair,
   and marveled not a little. Old Kranon again insisted that it was the
   dark folk who had taken them, since cats did not return alive from the
   cottage of the ancient man and his wife. But all agreed on one thing:
   that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink
   their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious. And for two whole days
   the sleek, lazy cats of Ulthar would touch no food, but only doze by
   the fire or in the sun.
         It was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights
   were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees.
   Then the lean Nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his
   wife since the night the cats were away. In another week the
   burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely
   silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful
   to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as
   witnesses. And when they had broken down the frail door they found only
   this: two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor, and a
   number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners.
         There was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of Ulthar.
   Zath, the coroner, disputed at length with Nith, the lean notary; and
   Kranon and Shang and Thul were overwhelmed with questions. Even little
   Atal, the innkeeper's son, was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat
   as reward. They talked of the old cotter and his wife, of the caravan
   of dark wanderers, of small Menes and his black kitten, of the prayer
   of Menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the doings of the cats
   on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in the
   cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard.
         And in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is
   told of by traders in Hatheg and discussed by travelers in Nir; namely,
   that in Ulthar no man may kill a cat.

   227475The Challenge from BeyondC.L. Moore, Abraham Merritt, H.P.
   Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Frank Belknap Long.1935

   [C. L. Moore]

   George Campbell opened sleep-fogged eyes upon darkness and lay gazing
   out of the tent flap upon the pale August night for some minutes before
   he roused enough even to wonder what had wakened him. There was in the
   keen, clear air of these Canadian woods a soporific as potent as any
   drug. Campbell lay quiet for a moment, sinking slowly back into the
   delicious borderlands of sleep, conscious of an exquisite weariness, an
   unaccustomed sense of muscles well used, and relaxed now into perfect
   ease. These were vacation's most delightful moments, after all -- rest,
   after toil, in the clear, sweet forest night.

   Luxuriously, as his mind sank backward into oblivion, he assured
   himself once more that three long months of freedom lay before him --
   freedom from cities and monotony, freedom from pedagogy and the
   University and students with no rudiments of interest in the geology he
   earned his daily bread by dinning into their obdurate ears. Freedom
   from --

   Abruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him. Somewhere outside
   the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed into his peace. George
   Campbell sat up jerkily and reached for his flashlight. Then he laughed
   and put it down again, straining his eyes through the midnight gloom
   outside where among the tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous
   little night beast was prowling. He stretched out a long arm and groped
   about among the rocks at the tent door for a missile. His fingers
   closed on a large stone, and he drew back his hand to throw.

   But he never threw it. It was such a queer thing he had come upon in
   the dark. Square, crystal smooth, obviously artificial, with dull
   rounded corners. The strangeness of its rock surfaces to his fingers
   was so remarkable that he reached again for his flashlight and turned
   its rays upon the thing he held.

   All sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up in his
   idle groping. It was clear as rock crystal, this queer, smooth cube.
   Quartz, unquestionably, but not in its usual hexagonal crystallized
   form. Somehow -- he could not guess the method -- it had been wrought
   into a perfect cube, about four inches in measurement over each worn
   face. For it was incredibly worn. The hard, hard crystal was rounded
   now until its corners were almost gone and the thing was beginning to
   assume the outlines of a sphere. Ages and ages of wearing, years almost
   beyond counting, must have passed over this strange clear thing.

   But the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make out
   dimly in the heart of the crystal. For imbedded in its center lay a
   little disc of a pale and nameless substance with characters incised
   deep upon its quartz-enclosed surface. Wedge-shaped characters, faintly
   reminiscent of cuneiform writing.

   George Campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the little
   enigma in his hands, puzzling helplessly. How could such a thing as
   this have imbedded in pure rock crystal? Remotely a memory floated
   through his mind of ancient legends that called quartz crystals ice
   which had frozen too hard to melt again. Ice -- and wedge-shaped
   cuneiforms -- yes, didn't that sort of writing originate among the
   Sumerians who came down from the north in history's remotest beginnings
   to settle in the primitive Mesopotamian valley? Then hard sense
   regained control and he laughed. Quartz, of course, was formed in the
   earliest of earth's geological periods, when there was nothing anywhere
   but beat and heaving rock. Ice had not come for tens of millions of
   years after this thing must have been formed.

   And yet -- that writing. Man-made, surely, although its characters were
   unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at cuneiform shapes. Or could
   there, in a Paleozoic world, have been things with a written language
   who might have graven these cryptic wedges upon the quartz-enveloped
   disc he held? Or -- might a thing like this have fallen meteor-like out
   of space into the unformed rock of a still molten world? Could it --

   Then he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot at the
   luridness of his own imagination. The silence and the solitude and the
   queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play tricks with his common
   sense. He shrugged and laid the crystal down at the edge of his pallet,
   switching off the light. Perhaps morning and a clear head would bring
   him an answer to the questions that seemed so insoluble now.

   But sleep did not come easily. For one thing, it seemed to him as he
   flashed off the light, that the little cube had shone for a moment as
   if with sustained light before it faded into the surrounding dark. Or
   perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had been only his dazzled eyes that
   seemed to see the light forsake it reluctantly, glowing in the
   enigmatic deeps of the thing with queer persistence.

   He lay there unquietly for a long while, turning the unanswered
   questions over and over in his mind. There was something about this
   crystal cube out of the unmeasured past, perhaps from the dawn of all
   history, that constituted a challenge that would not let him sleep.

   [A. Merritt]

   He lay there, it seemed to him, for hours. It had been the lingering
   light, the luminescence that seemed so reluctant to die, which held his
   mind. It was as though something in the heart of the cube had awakened,
   stirred drowsily, become suddenly alert ... and intent upon him.

   Sheer fantasy, this. He stirred impatiently and flashed his light upon
   his watch. Close to one o'clock; three hours more before the dawn. The
   beam fell and was focused upon the warm crystal cube. He held it there
   closely, for minutes. He snapped it out, then watched.

   There was no doubt about it now. As his eyes accustomed themselves to
   the darkness, he saw that the strange crystal was glimmering with tiny
   fugitive lights deep within it like threads of sapphire lightnings.
   They were at its center and they seemed to him to come from the pale
   disk with its disturbing markings. And the disc itself was becoming
   larger ... the markings shifting shapes ... the cube was growing ...
   was it illusion brought about by the tiny lightnings....

   He heard a sound. It was the very ghost of a sound, like the ghosts of
   harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers. He bent closer. It
   came from the cube....

   There was squeaking in the underbrush, a flurry of bodies and an
   agonized wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly stilled. Some
   small tragedy of the wilderness, killer and prey. He stepped over to
   where it had been enacted, but could see nothing. He again snapped off
   the flash and looked toward his tent. Upon the ground was a pale blue
   glimmering. It was the cube. He stooped to pick it up; then obeying
   some obscure warning, drew back his hand.

   And again, he saw, its glow was dying. The tiny sapphire lightnings
   flashing fitfully, withdrawing to the disc from which they had come.
   There was no sound from it.

   He sat, watching the luminescence glow and fade, glow and fade, but
   steadily becoming dimmer. It came to him that two elements were
   necessary to produce the phenomenon. The electric ray itself, and his
   own fixed attention. His mind must travel along the ray, fix itself
   upon the cube's heart, if its beat were to wax, until ... what?

   He felt a chill of spirit, as though from contact with some alien
   thing. It was alien, he knew it; not of this earth. Not of earth's
   life. He conquered his shrinking, picked up the cube and took it into
   the tent. It was neither warm nor cold; except for its weight he would
   not have known he held it. He put it upon the table, keeping the torch
   turned from it; then stepped to the flap of the tent and closed it.

   He went back to the table, drew up the camp chair, and turned the flash
   directly upon the cube, focusing it so far as he could upon its heart.
   He sent all his will, all his concentration, along it; focusing will
   and sight upon the disc as he had the light.

   As though at command, the sapphire lightnings burned forth. They burst
   from the disc into the body of the crystal cube, then beat back,
   bathing the disc and the markings. Again these began to change,
   shifting, moving, advancing, and retreating in the blue gleaming. They
   were no longer cuneiform. They were things ... objects.

   He heard the murmuring music, the plucked harp strings. Louder grew the
   sound and louder, and now all the body of the cube vibrated to their
   rhythm. The crystal walls were melting, growing misty as though formed
   of the mist of diamonds. And the disc itself was growing ... the shapes
   shifting, dividing and multiplying as though some door had been opened
   and into it companies of phantasms were pouring. While brighter, more
   bright grew the pulsing light.

   He felt swift panic, tried to withdraw sight and will, dropped the
   flash. The cube had no need now of the ray ... and he could not
   withdraw ... could not withdraw? Why, he himself was being sucked into
   that disc which was now a globe within which unnameable shapes danced
   to a music that bathed the globe with steady radiance.

   There was no tent. There was only a vast curtain of sparkling mist
   behind which shone the globe.... He felt himself drawn through that
   mist, sucked through it as if by a mighty wind, straight for the globe.

   [H. P. Lovecraft]

   As the mist-blurred light of the sapphire suns grew more and more
   intense, the outlines of the globe ahead wavered and dissolved to a
   churning chaos. Its pallor and its motion and its music all blended
   themselves with the engulfing mist- bleaching it to a pale steel-colour
   and setting it undulantly in motion. And the sapphire suns, too, melted
   imperceptibly into the greying infinity of shapeless pulsation.

   Meanwhile the sense of forward, outward motion grew intolerably,
   incredibly, cosmically swift. Every standard of speed known to earth
   seemed dwarfed, and Campbell knew that any such flight in physical
   reality would mean instant death to a human being. Even as it was -- in
   this strange, hellish hypnosis or nightmare -- the quasi-visual
   impression of meteor-like hurtling almost paralyzed his mind. Though
   there were no real points of reference in the grey, pulsing void, he
   felt that he was approaching and passing the speed of light itself.
   Finally his consciousness did go under -- and merciful blackness
   swallowed everything.

   It was very suddenly, and amidst the most impenetrable darkness, that
   thoughts and ideas again came to George Campbell. Of how many moments
   -- or years -- or eternities -- had elapsed since his flight through
   the grey void, he could form no estimate. He knew only that he seemed
   to be at rest and without pain. Indeed, the absence of all physical
   sensation was the salient quality of his condition. It made even the
   blackness seem less solidly black -- suggesting as it did that he was
   rather a disembodied intelligence in a state beyond physical senses,
   than a corporeal being with senses deprived of their accustomed objects
   of perception. He could think sharply and quickly -- almost
   preternaturally so -- yet could form no idea whatsoever of his
   situation.

   Half by instinct, he realised that he was not in his own tent. True, he
   might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world equally black; yet
   he knew this was not so. There was no camp cot beneath him -- he had no
   hands to feel the blankets and canvas surface and flashlight that ought
   to be around him -- there was no sensation of cold in the air -- no
   flap through which he could glimpse the pale night outside ...
   something was wrong, dreadfully wrong.

   He cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube which had
   hypnotised him -- of that, and all which had followed. He had known
   that his mind was going, yet had been unable to draw back. At the last
   moment there had been a shocking, panic fear -- a subconscious fear
   beyond even that caused by the sensation of daemonic flight. It had
   come from some vague flash or remote recollection -- just what, he
   could not at once tell. Some cell-group in the back of his head had
   seemed to find a cloudily familiar quality in the cube -- and that
   familiarity was fraught with dim terror. Now he tried to remember what
   the familiarity and the terror were.

   Little by little it came to him. Once -- long ago, in connection with
   his geological life-work -- he had read of something like that cube. It
   had to do with those debatable and disquieting clay fragments called
   the Eltdown Shards, dug up from pre-carboniferous strata in southern
   England thirty years before. Their shape and markings were so queer
   that a few scholars hinted at artificiality, and made wild conjectures
   about them and their origin. They came, clearly, from a time when no
   human beings could exist on the globe -- but their contours and
   figurings were damnably puzzling. That was how they got their name.

   It was not, however, in the writings of any sober scientist that
   Campbell had seen that reference to a crystal, disc-holding globe. The
   source was far less reputable, and infinitely more vivid. About 1912 a
   deeply learned Sussex clergyman of occultist leanings -- the Reverend
   Arthur Brooke Winters-Hall -- had professed to identify the markings on
   the Eltdown Shards with some of the so-called "pre-human hieroglyphs"
   persistently cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical
   circles, and had published at his own expense what purported to be a
   "translation" of the primal and baffling "inscriptions" -- a
   "translation" still quoted frequently and seriously by occult writers.
   In this "translation' -- a surprisingly long brochure in view of the
   limited number of "shards" existing -- had occurred the narrative,
   supposedly of pre-human authorship, containing the now frightening
   reference.

   As the story went, there dwelt on a world -- and eventually on
   countless other worlds -- of outer space a mighty order of worm-like
   beings whose attainments and whose control of nature surpassed anything
   within the range of terrestrial imagination. They had mastered the art
   of interstellar travel early in their career, and had peopled every
   habitable planet in their own galaxy - killing off the races they
   found.

   Beyond the limits of their own galaxy -- which was not ours -- they
   could not navigate in person; but in their quest for knowledge of all
   space and time they discovered a means of spanning certain
   transgalactic gulfs with their minds. They devised peculiar objects --
   strangely energized cubes of a curious crystal containing hypnotic
   talismen and enclosed in space-resisting spherical envelopes of an
   unknown substance -- which could be forcibly expelled beyond the limits
   of their universe, and which would respond to the attraction of cool
   solid matter only.

   These, of which a few would necessarily land on various inhabited
   worlds in outside universes, formed the ether-bridges needed for mental
   communication. Atmospheric friction burned away the protecting
   envelope, leaving the cube exposed and subject to discovery by the
   intelligent minds of the world where it fell. By its very nature, the
   cube would attract and rivet attention. This, when coupled with the
   action of light, was sufficient to set its special properties working.

   The mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the power of
   the disc, and would be sent on a thread of obscure energy to the place
   whence the disc had come -- the remote world of the worm-like space
   explorers across stupendous galactic abysses. Received in one of the
   machines to which each cube was attuned, the captured mind would remain
   suspended without body or senses until examined by one of the dominant
   race. Then it would, by an obscure process of interchange, be pumped of
   all its contents. The investigator's mind would now occupy the strange
   machine while the captive mind occupied the interrogator's worm-like
   body. Then, in another interchange, the interrogator's mind would leap
   across boundless space to the captive's vacant and unconscious body on
   the trans-galactic world -- animating the alien tenement as best it
   might, and exploring the alien world in the guise of one of its
   denizens.

   When done with exploration, the adventurer would use the cube and its
   disc in accomplishing his return -- and sometimes the captured mind
   would be restored safely to its own remote world. Not always, however,
   was the dominant race so kind. Sometimes, when a potentially important
   race capable of space travel was found, the worm-like folk would employ
   the cube to capture and annihilate minds by the thousands, and would
   extirpate the race for diplomatic reasons -- using the exploring minds
   as agents of destruction.

   In other cases sections of the worm-folk would permanently occupy a
   trans-galactic planet - destroying the captured minds and wiping out
   the remaining inhabitants preparatory to settling down in unfamiliar
   bodies. Never, however, could the parent civilization be quite
   duplicated in such a case; since the new planet would not contain all
   the materials necessary for the worm-race's arts. The cubes, for
   example, could be made only on the home planet.

   Only a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a landing and
   response on an inhabited world - since there was no such thing as
   aiming them at goals beyond sight or knowledge. Only three, ran the
   story, had ever landed on peopled worlds in our own particular
   universe. One of these had struck a planet near the galactic rim two
   thousand billion years ago, while another had lodged three billion
   years ago on a world near the centre of the galaxy. The third -- and
   the only one ever known to have invaded the solar system -- had reached
   our own earth 150,000,000 years ago.

   It was with this latter that Dr. Winters-Hall's "translation" chiefly
   dealt. When the cube struck the earth, he wrote, the ruling terrestrial
   species was a huge, cone-shaped race surpassing all others before or
   since in mentality and achievements. This race was so advanced that it
   had actually sent minds abroad in both space and time to explore the
   cosmos, hence recognised something of what had happened when the cube
   fell from the sky and certain individuals had suffered mental change
   after gazing at it.

   Realising that the changed individuals represented invading minds, the
   race's leaders had them destroyed -- even at the cost of leaving the
   displaced minds exiled in alien space. They had had experience with
   even stranger transitions. When, through a mental exploration of space
   and time, they formed a rough idea of what the cube was, they carefully
   hid the thing from light and sight, and guarded it as a menace. They
   did not wish to destroy a thing so rich in later experimental
   possibilities. Now and then some rash, unscrupulous adventurer would
   furtively gain access to it and sample its perilous powers despite the
   consequences -- but all such cases were discovered, and safely and
   drastically dealt with.

   Of this evil meddling the only bad result was that the worm-like
   outside race learned from the new exiles what had happened to their
   explorers on earth, and conceived a violent hatred of the planet and
   all its life-forms. They would have depopulated it if they could, and
   indeed sent additional cubes into space in the wild hope of striking it
   by accident in unguarded places -- but that accident never came to
   pass.

   The cone-shaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube in a
   special shrine as a relique and basis for experiments, till after aeons
   it was lost amidst the chaos of war and the destruction of the great
   polar city where it was guarded. When, fifty million years ago, the
   beings sent their minds ahead into the infinite future to avoid a
   nameless peril of inner earth, the whereabouts of the sinister cube
   from space were unknown.

   This much, according to the learned occultist, the Eltdown Shards had
   said. What now made the account so obscurely frightful to Campbell was
   the minute accuracy with which the alien cube had been described. Every
   detail tallied -- dimensions, consistency, heiroglyphed central disc,
   hypnotic effects. As he thought the matter over and over amidst the
   darkness of his strange situation, he began to wonder whether his whole
   experience with the crystal cube -- indeed, its very existence -- were
   not a nightmare brought on by some freakish subconscious memory of this
   old bit of extravagant, charlatanic reading. If so, though, the
   nightmare must still be in force; since his present apparently bodiless
   state had nothing of normality in it.

   Of the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection, Campbell
   could form no estimate. Everything about his state was so unreal that
   ordinary dimensions and measurements became meaningless. It seemed an
   eternity, but perhaps it was not really long before the sudden
   interruption came. What happened was as strange and inexplicable as the
   blackness it succeeded. There was a sensation - of the mind rather than
   of the body -- and all at once Campbell felt his thoughts swept or
   sucked beyond his control in tumultuous and chaotic fashion.

   Memories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly. All that he knew -- all
   his personal background, traditions, experiences, scholarship, dreams,
   ideas, and inspirations-welled up abruptly and simultaneously, with a
   dizzying speed and abundance which soon made him unable to keep track
   of any separate concept. The parade of all his mental contents became
   an avalanche, a cascade, a vortex. It was as horrible and vertiginous
   as his hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him.
   Finally it sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh oblivion.

   Another measureless blank -- and then a slow trickle of sensation. This
   time it was physical, not mental. Sapphire light, and a low rumble of
   distant sound. There were tactile impressions -- he could realise that
   he was lying at full length on something, though there was a baffling
   strangeness about the feel of his posture. He could not reconcile the
   pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlines -- or with the
   outlines of the human form at all. He tried to move his arms, but found
   no definite response to the attempt. Instead, there were little,
   ineffectual nervous twitches all over the area which seemed to mark his
   body.

   He tried to open his eyes more widely, but found himself unable to
   control their mechanism. The sapphire light came in a diffused,
   nebulous manner, and could nowhere be voluntarily focussed into
   definiteness. Gradually, though, visual images began to trickle in
   curiously and indecisively. The limits and qualities of vision were not
   those which he was used to, but he could roughly correlate the
   sensation with what he had known as sight. As this sensation gained
   some degree of stability, Campbell realised that he must still be in
   the throes of nightmare.

   He seemed to be in a room of considerable extent -- of medium height,
   but with a large proportionate area. On every side -- and he could
   apparently see all four sides at once -- were high, narrowish slits
   which seemed to serve as combined doors and windows. There were
   singular low tables or pedestals, but no furniture of normal nature and
   proportions. Through the slits streamed floods of sapphire light, and
   beyond them could be mistily seen the sides and roofs of fantastic
   buildings like clustered cubes. On the walls - in the vertical panels
   between the slits - were strange markings of an oddly disquieting
   character. It was some time before Campbell understood why they
   disturbed him so -- then he saw that they were, in repeated instances,
   precisely like some of the hieroglyphs on the crystal cube's disc.

   The actual nightmare element, though, was something more than this. It
   began with the living thing which presently entered through one of the
   slits, advancing deliberately toward him and bearing a metal box of
   bizarre proportions and glassy, mirror-like surfaces. For this thing
   was nothing human -- nothing of earth -- nothing even of man's myths
   and dreams. It was a gigantic, pale-grey worm or centipede, as large
   around as a man and twice as long, with a disc-like, apparently
   eyeless, cilia-fringed head bearing a purple central orifice. It glided
   on its rear pairs of legs, with its fore part raised vertically -- the
   legs, or at least two pairs of them, serving as arms. Along its spinal
   ridge was a curious purple comb, and a fan-shaped tail of some grey
   membrane ended its grotesque bulk. There was a ring of flexible red
   spikes around its neck, and from the twistings of these came clicking,
   twanging sounds in measured, deliberate rhythms.

   Here, indeed, was outré nightmare at its height -- capricious fantasy
   at its apex. But even this vision of delirium was not what caused
   George Campbell to lapse a third time into unconsciousness. It took one
   more thing -- one final, unbearable touch -- to do that. As the
   nameless worm advanced with its glistening box, the reclining man
   caught in the mirror-like surface a glimpse of what should have been
   his own body. Yet -- horribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar
   sensations -- it was not his own body at all that he saw reflected in
   the burnished metal. It was, instead, the loathsome, pale-grey bulk of
   one of the great centipedes.

   [Robert E. Howard]

   From that final lap of senselessness, he emerged with a full
   understanding of his situation. His mind was imprisoned in the body of
   a frightful native of an alien planet, while, somewhere on the other
   side of the universe, his own body was housing the monster's
   personality.

   He fought down an unreasoning horror. Judged from a cosmic standpoint,
   why should his metamorphosis horrify him? Life and consciousness were
   the only realities in the universe. Form was unimportant. His present
   body was hideous only according to terrestrial standards. Fear and
   revulsion were drowned in the excitement of titanic adventure.

   What was his former body but a cloak, eventually to be cast off at
   death anyway? He had no sentimental illusions about the life from which
   he had been exiled. What had it ever given him save toil, poverty,
   continual frustration and repression? If this life before him offered
   no more, at least it offered no less. Intuition told him it offered
   more -- much more.

   With the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its naked
   fundamentals, he realized that he remembered with pleasure only the
   physical delights of his former life. But he had long ago exhausted all
   the physical possibilities contained in that earthly body. Earth held
   no new thrills. But in the possession of this new, alien body he felt
   promises of strange, exotic joys.

   A lawless exultation rose in him. He was a man without a world, free of
   all conventions or inhibitions of Earth, or of this strange planet,
   free of every artificial restraint in the universe. He was a god! With
   grim amusement he thought of his body moving in earth's business and
   society, with all the while an alien monster staring out of the windows
   that were George Campbell's eyes on people who would flee if they knew.

   Let him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would. Earth and
   its races no longer had any meaning to George Campbell. There he had
   been one of a billion nonentities, fixed in place by a mountainous
   accumulation of conventions, laws and manners, doomed to live and die
   in his sordid niche. But in one blind bound he had soared above the
   commonplace. This was not death, but re-birth -- the birth of a
   full-grown mentality, with a new-found freedom that made little of
   physical captivity on Yekub.

   He started. Yekub! It was the name of this planet, but how had he
   known? Then he knew, as he knew the name of him whose body he occupied-
   Tothe. Memory, deep grooved in Tothe's brain, was stirring in him -
   shadows of the knowledge Tothe had. Carved deep in the physical tissues
   of the brain, they spoke dimly as implanted instincts to George
   Campbell; and his human consciousness seized them and translated them
   to show him the way not only to safety and freedom, but to the power
   his soul, stripped to its primitive impulses, craved. Not as a slave
   would he dwell on Yekub, but as a king! Just as of old barbarians had
   sat on the throne of lordly empires.

   For the first time he turned his attention to his surroundings. He
   still lay on the couch-like thing in the midst of that fantastic room,
   and the centipede man stood before him, holding the polished metal
   object, and clashing its neck-spikes. Thus it spoke to him, Campbell
   knew, and what it said he dimly understood, through the implanted
   thought processes of Tothe, just as he knew the creature was Yukth,
   supreme lord of science.

   But Campbell gave no heed, for he had made his desperate plan, a plan
   so alien to the ways of Yekub that it was beyond Yukth's comprehension
   and caught him wholly unprepared. Yukth, like Campbell, saw the
   sharp-pointed metal shard on a nearby table, but to Yukth it was only a
   scientific implement. He did not even know it could be used as a
   weapon. Campbell's earthly mind supplied the knowledge and the action
   that followed, driving Tothe's body into movements no man of Yekub had
   ever made before.

   Campbell snatched the pointed shard and struck, ripping savagely
   upward. Yukth reared and toppled, his entrails spilling on the floor.
   In an instant Campbell was streaking for a door. His speed was amazing,
   exhilarating, first fulfillment of the promise of novel physical
   sensations.

   As he ran, guided wholly by the instinctive knowledge implanted in
   Tothe's physical reflexes, it was as if he were borne by a separate
   consciousness in his legs. Tothe's body was bearing him along a route
   it had traversed ten thousand times when animated by Tothe's mind.

   Down a winding corridor he raced, up a twisted stair, through a carved
   door, and the same instincts that had brought him there told him he had
   found what he sought. He was in a circular room with a domed roof from
   which shone a livid blue light. A strange structure rose in the middle
   of the rainbow-hued floor, tier on tier, each of a separate, vivid
   color. The ultimate tier was a purple cone, from the apex of which a
   blue smoky mist drifted upward to a sphere that poised in mid-air -- a
   sphere that shone like translucent ivory.

   This, the deep-grooved memories of Tothe told Campbell, was the god of
   Yekub, though why the people of Yekub feared and worshipped it had been
   forgotten a million years. A worm-priest stood between him and the
   altar which no hand of flesh had ever touched. That it could be touched
   was a blasphemy that had never occurred to a man of Yekub. The
   worm-priest stood in frozen horror until Campbell's shard ripped the
   life out of him.

   On his centipede-legs Campbell clambered the tiered altar, heedless of
   its sudden quiverings, heedless of the change that was taking place in
   the floating sphere, heedless of the smoke that now billowed out in
   blue clouds. He was drunk with the feel of power. He feared the
   superstitions of Yekub no more than he feared those of earth. With that
   globe in his hands he would be king of Yekub. The worm men would dare
   deny him nothing, when he held their god as hostage. He reached a hand
   for the ball -- no longer ivory-hued, but red as blood....

   [Frank Belknap Long]

   Out of the tent into the pale August night walked the body of George
   Campbell. It moved with a slow, wavering gait between the bodies of
   enormous trees, over a forest path strewed with sweet scented pine
   needles. The air was crisp and cold. The sky was an inverted bowl of
   frosted silver flecked with stardust, and far to the north the Aurora
   Borealis splashed streamers of fire.

   The head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to side. From
   the corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of amber froth,
   which fluttered in the night breeze. He walked upright at first, as a
   man would walk, but gradually as the tent receded, his posture altered.
   His torso began almost imperceptibly to slant, and his limbs to
   shorten.

   In a far-off world of outer space the centipede creature that was
   George Campbell clasped to its bosom a god whose lineaments were red as
   blood, and ran with insect-like quiverings across a rainbow-hued hall
   and out through massive portals into the bright glow of alien suns.

   Weaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that suggested the
   awkward loping of a werebeast, the body of George Campbell was
   fulfilling a mindless destiny. Long, claw-tipped fingers dragged leaves
   from a carpet of odorous pine needles as it moved toward a wide expanse
   of gleaming water.

   In the far-off, extra-galactic world of the worm people, George
   Campbell moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry down long,
   fern-planted avenues holding aloft the round red god.

   There was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the gleaming lake
   on earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in a body swayed by
   instinct. Human teeth sank into soft animal fur, tore at black animal
   flesh. A little silver fox sank its fangs in frantic retaliation into a
   furry human wrist, and thrashed about in terror as its blood spurted.
   Slowly the body of George Campbell arose, its mouth splashed with fresh
   blood. With upper limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of
   the lake.

   As the variform creature that was George Campbell crawled between the
   black blocks of stone thousands of worm-shapes prostrated themselves in
   the scintillating dust before it. A godlike power seemed to emanate
   from its weaving body as it moved with a slow, undulant motion toward a
   throne of spiritual empire transcending all the sovereignties of earth.

   A trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth near the
   tent where the worm-creature dwelt in the body of George Campbell came
   to the gleaming waters of the lake and discerned something dark
   floating there. He had been lost in the woods all night, and weariness
   enveloped him like a leaden cloak in the pale morning light.

   But the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore. Moving to the
   edge of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out toward the
   floating bulk. Slowly he pulled it to the shore.

   Far off in outer space the worm-creature holding the glowing red god
   ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation Cassiopeia under
   an alien vault of hyper-suns. The great deity that he held aloft
   energized his worm tenement, burning away in the white fire of a
   supermundane spirituality all animal dross.

   On earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the blackened
   and hairy face of the drowned man. It was a bestial face, repulsively
   anthropoid in contour, and from its twisted, distorted mouth black
   ichor poured.

   "He who sought your body in the abysses of Time will occupy an
   unresponsive tenement," said the red god. "No spawn of Yekub can
   control the body of a human.

   "On all earth, living creatures rend one another, and feast with
   unutterable cruelty on their kith and kin. No worm-mind can control a
   bestial man-body when it yearns to raven. Only man-minds instinctively
   conditioned through the course of ten thousand generations can keep the
   human instincts in thrall. Your body will destroy itself on earth,
   seeking the blood of its animal kin, seeking the cool water where it
   can wallow at its ease. Seeking eventually destruction, for the
   death-instinct is more powerful in it than the instincts of life and it
   will destroy itself in seeking to return to the slime from which it
   sprang."

   Thus spoke the round red god of Yekub in a far-off segment of the
   space-time continuum to George Campbell as the latter, with all human
   desire purged away, sat on a throne and ruled an empire of worms more
   wisely, kindly, and benevolently than any man of earth had ever ruled
   an empire of men.

   12045The CityH. P. Lovecraft

   It was golden and splendid,
     That City of light;
   A vision suspended
     In deeps of the night;
   A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.

   I remember the season
     It dawn'd on my gaze;
   The mad time of unreason,
     The brain-numbing days
   When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and
   craze.

   More lovely than Zion
     It shone in the sky
   When the beams of Orion
     Beclouded my eye,
   Bringing sleep that was filled with dim mem'ries of moments obscure and
   gone by.

   Its mansions were stately,
     With carvings made fair,
   Each rising sedately
     On terraces rare,
   And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles
   blossoming there.

   The avenues lur'd me
     With vistas sublime;
   Tall arches assur'd me
     That once on a time
   I had wander'd in rapture beneath them, and bask'd in the Halcyon
   clime.

   On the plazas were standing
     A sculptur'd array;
   Long bearded, commanding,
     Grave men in their day--
   But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face battered away.

   In that city effulgent
     No mortal I saw,
   But my fancy, indulgent
     To memory's law,
   Linger'd long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features
   with awe.

   I fann'd the faint ember
     That glow'd in my mind,
   And strove to remember
     The aeons behind;
   To rove thro' infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin'd.

   Then the horrible warning
     Upon my soul sped
   Like the ominous morning
     That rises in red,
   And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead.

   The Colour Out of Space  (1927)
   by H.P. Lovecraft

    The Colour Out of Space is a short story by American horror writer H.
   P. Lovecraft. Written in March 1927 and initially published in Amazing
      Stories in September 1927, it became one of his most anthologized
   works. -- Excerpted from The Colour Out of Space on Wikipedia, the free

   8392The Colour Out of SpaceH.P. Lovecraft1927

   WEST of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep
   woods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the
   trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without
   ever having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there
   are farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding
   eternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but
   these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled
   sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.

   The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there.
   French-Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles
   have come and departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen
   or heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined. The
   place is not good for the imagination, and does not bring restful
   dreams at night. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for
   old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the
   strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is
   the only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days;
   and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields
   and the travelled roads around Arkham.

   There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran
   straight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it
   and a new road was laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the old
   one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness, and
   some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are
   flooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and
   the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will
   mirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the strange
   days will be one with the deep's secrets; one with the hidden lore of
   old ocean, and all the mystery of primal earth.

   When I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir
   they told me the place was evil. They told me this in Arkham, and
   because that is a very old town full of witch legends I thought the
   evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through
   centuries. The name "blasted heath" seemed to me very odd and
   theatrical, and I wondered how it had come into the folklore of a
   Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of glens and
   slopes for myself, and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own
   elder mystery. It was morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always
   there. The trees grew too thickly, and their trunks were too big for
   any healthy New England wood. There was too much silence in the dim
   alleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and
   mattings of infinite years of decay.

   In the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were
   little hillside farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing,
   sometimes with only one or two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney
   or fast-filling cellar. Weeds and briers reigned, and furtive wild
   things rustled in the undergrowth. Upon everything was a haze of
   restlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque,
   as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry. I did
   not wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region
   to sleep in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too
   much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror.

   But even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the
   moment I came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other
   name could fit such a thing, or any other thing fit such a name. It was
   as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one
   particular region. It must, I thought as I viewed it, be the outcome of
   a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of
   grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten
   by acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the
   ancient road line, but encroached a little on the other side. I felt an
   odd reluctance about approaching, and did so at last only because my
   business took me through and past it. There was no vegetation of any
   kind on that broad expanse, but only a fine grey dust or ash which no
   wind seemed ever to blow about. The trees near it were sickly and
   stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim. As I
   walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old
   chimney and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an
   abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the
   hues of the sunlight. Even the long, dark woodland climb beyond seemed
   welcome in contrast, and I marvelled no more at the frightened whispers
   of Arkham people. There had been no house or ruin near; even in the old
   days the place must have been lonely and remote. And at twilight,
   dreading to repass that ominous spot, I walked circuitously back to the
   town by the curving road on the south. I vaguely wished some clouds
   would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had
   crept into my soul.

   In the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath,
   and what was meant by that phrase "strange days" which so many
   evasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers except
   that all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was
   not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime
   of those who spoke. It had happened in the 'eighties, and a family had
   disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because
   they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce's crazy tales,
   I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in
   the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very
   thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and had begun to exude the
   faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long.
   Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he
   shuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He
   was not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious
   way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn
   and dismal.

   Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned
   a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague
   questions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated
   than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite as
   much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not
   like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to
   be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and
   farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been had
   not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all
   that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through
   which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water
   now--better under water since the strange days. And with this opening
   his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right
   forefinger began to point shakily and impressively.

   It was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped
   and whispered on I shivered again and again despite the summer day.
   Often I had to recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific
   points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors'
   talk, or bridge over gaps, where his sense of logic and continuity
   broke down. When he was done I did not wonder that his mind had snapped
   a trifle, or that the folk of Arkham would not speak much of the
   blasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel, unwilling to
   have the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned
   to Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos of
   old forest and slope again, or face another time that grey blasted
   heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and
   stones. The reservoir will soon be built now, and all those elder
   secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms. But even then I do
   not believe I would like to visit that country by night--at least not
   when the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink
   the new city water of Arkham.

   It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there
   had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials, and even then
   these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in
   the Miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone altar
   older than the Indians. These were not haunted woods, and their
   fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days. Then there had
   come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in the air,
   and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by night
   all Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and
   bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner place.
   That was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to
   come--the trim white Nahum Gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and
   orchards.

   Nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and had dropped
   in at Ammi Pierce's on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer
   things were fixed very strongly in his mind. He and his wife had gone
   with the three professors from Miskatonic University who hastened out
   the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space,
   and had wondered why Nahum had called it so large the day before. It
   had shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above
   the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic well-sweep in his
   front yard; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink. Its
   heat lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed faintly in
   the night. The professors tried it with a geologist's hammer and found
   it was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be almost plastic;
   and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the
   college for testing. They took it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum's
   kitchen, for even the small piece refused to grow cool. On the trip
   back they stopped at Ammi's to rest, and seemed thoughtful when Mrs.
   Pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the
   bottom of the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps they had taken
   less than they thought.

   The day after that--all this was in June of '82--the professors had
   trooped out again in a great excitement. As they passed Ammi's they
   told him what queer things the specimen had done, and how it had faded
   wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker. The beaker had gone,
   too, and the wise men talked of the strange stone's affinity for
   silicon. It had acted quite unbelievably in that well-ordered
   laboratory; doing nothing at all and shewing no occluded gases when
   heated on charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon
   proving itself absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature,
   including that of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared
   highly malleable, and in the dark its luminosity was very marked.
   Stubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the college in a state of
   real excitement; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it
   displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum
   there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical
   properties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to
   say when faced by the unknown.

   Hot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper
   reagents. Water did nothing. Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric
   acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid
   invulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things, but
   recognized some solvents as I mentioned them in the usual order of use.
   There were ammonia and caustic soda, alcohol and ether, nauseous carbon
   disulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew steadily
   less as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling,
   there was no change in the solvents to shew that they had attacked the
   substance at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was
   magnetic, for one thing; and after its immersion in the acid solvents
   there seemed to be faint traces of the Widmanstätten figures found on
   meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown very considerable, the
   testing was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker that they
   left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work. The
   next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace, and only a
   charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been.

   All this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and once
   more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars,
   though this time his wife did not accompany him. It had now most
   certainly shrunk, and even the sober professors could not doubt the
   truth of what they saw. All around the dwindling brown lump near the
   well was a vacant space, except where the earth had caved in; and
   whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it was now
   scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its surface
   curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and
   chisel. They gouged deeply this time, and as they pried away the
   smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite
   homogeneous.

   They had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured
   globule imbedded in the substance. The colour, which resembled some of
   the bands in the meteor's strange spectrum, was almost impossible to
   describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all.
   Its texture was glossy, and upon tapping it appeared to promise both
   brittleness and hollowness. One of the professors gave it a smart blow
   with a hammer, and it burst with a nervous little pop. Nothing was
   emitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing. It
   left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and all
   thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing
   substance wasted away.

   Conjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional
   globules by drilling, the seekers left again with their new
   specimen--which proved, however, as baffling in the laboratory as its
   predecessor had been. Aside from being almost plastic, having heat,
   magnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful acids,
   possessing an unknown spectrum, wasting away in air, and attacking
   silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented no
   identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the
   college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it. It
   was nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great outside; and as
   such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws.

   That night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out
   to Nahum's the next day they met with a bitter disappointment. The
   stone, magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical
   property; for it had "drawn the lightning," as Nahum said, with a
   singular persistence. Six times within an hour the farmer saw the
   lightning strike the furrow in the front yard, and when the storm was
   over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient well-sweep,
   half-choked with caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and the
   scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was
   total; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and
   test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That
   fragment lasted a week, at the end of which nothing of value had been
   learned of it. When it had gone, no residue was left behind, and in
   time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking
   eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside; that lone,
   weird message from other universes and other realms of matter, force,
   and entity.

   As was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its
   collegiate sponsoring, and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner
   and his family. At least one Boston daily also sent a scribe, and Nahum
   quickly became a kind of local celebrity. He was a lean, genial person
   of about fifty, living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant
   farmstead in the valley. He and Ammi exchanged visits frequently, as
   did their wives; and Ammi had nothing but praise for him after all
   these years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had
   attracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks.
   That July and August were hot; and Nahum worked hard at his haying in
   the ten-acre pasture across Chapman's Brook; his rattling wain wearing
   deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him more than
   it had in other years, and he felt that age was beginning to tell on
   him.

   Then fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly
   ripened, and Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never
   before. The fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss,
   and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the
   future crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment; for of all
   that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit
   to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a
   stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest of bites
   induced a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and
   tomatoes, and Nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to
   connect events, he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil,
   and thanked Heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot
   along the road.

   Winter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than
   usual, and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his
   family, too, seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady in
   their church-going or their attendance at the various social events of
   the countryside. For this reserve or melancholy no cause could be
   found, though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health
   and a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum himself gave the most definite
   statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain
   footprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints of red
   squirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed
   to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement. He
   was never specific, but appeared to think that they were not as
   characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and
   foxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk
   until one night when he drove past Nahum's house in his sleigh on the
   way back from Clark's Corners. There had been a moon, and a rabbit had
   run across the road, and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than
   either Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away
   when brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum's tales more
   respect, and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and
   quivering every morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit
   to bark.

   In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting
   woodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar
   specimen. The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a
   queer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an
   expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were
   genuinely frightened, and threw the thing away at once, so that only
   their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside.
   But the shying of the horses near Nahum's house had now become an
   acknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend
   was fast taking form.

   People vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum's than it did
   anywhere else, and early in March there was an awed discussion in
   Potter's general store at Clark's Corners. Stephen Rice had driven past
   Gardner's in the morning, and had noticed the skunk-cabbages coming up
   through the mud by the woods across the road. Never were things of such
   size seen before, and they held strange colours that could not be put
   into any words. Their shapes were monstrous, and the horse had snorted
   at an odour which struck Stephen as wholly unprecedented. That
   afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth, and
   all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy
   world. The bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned, and it
   went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in Nahum's ground. Of
   course it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from
   the college had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the
   matter to them.

   One day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and
   folklore were very conservative in what they inferred. The plants were
   certainly odd, but all skunk-cabbages are more or less odd in shape and
   odour and hue. Perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered
   the soil, but it would soon be washed away. And as for the footprints
   and frightened horses--of course this was mere country talk which such
   a phenomenon as the aërolite would be certain to start. There was
   really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip, for
   superstitious rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through
   the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt. Only one of
   them, when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a
   year and a half later, recalled that the queer colour of that
   skunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light
   shewn by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the
   brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples
   in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first, though later
   they lost the property.

   The trees budded prematurely around Nahum's, and at night they swayed
   ominously in the wind. Nahum's second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen,
   swore that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the
   gossips would not credit this. Certainly, however, restlessness was in
   the air. The entire Gardner family developed the habit of stealthy
   listening, though not for any sound which they could consciously name.
   The listening was, indeed, rather a product of moments when
   consciousness seemed half to slip away. Unfortunately such moments
   increased week by week, till it became common speech that "something
   was wrong with all Nahum's folks." When the early saxifrage came out it
   had another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage,
   but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum
   took some blossoms to Arkham and shewed them to the editor of the
   Gazette, but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article
   about them, in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite
   ridicule. It was a mistake of Nahum's to tell a stolid city man about
   the way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak butterflies behaved in
   connexion with these saxifrages.

   April brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that
   disuse of the road past Nahum's which led to its ultimate abandonment.
   It was the vegetation. All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange
   colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage
   there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect
   with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were
   anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but
   everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased,
   underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth.
   The "Dutchman's breeches" became a thing of sinister menace, and the
   bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the
   Gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting
   familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule
   in the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the
   upland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it
   would be of no use, and hoped that the summer's strange growths would
   draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything
   now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to
   be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbors told on him, of
   course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being
   at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the
   gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most.

   In May the insects came, and Nahum's place became a nightmare of
   buzzing and crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in
   their aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all
   former experience. The Gardners took to watching at night--watching in
   all directions at random for something . . . they could not tell what.
   It was then that they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the
   trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the window as she
   watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. The boughs
   surely moved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness
   had come into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum's family
   at all who made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and
   what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from
   Bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends. What
   he told in Arkham was given a short paragraph in the Gazette; and it
   was there that all the farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night
   had been dark and the buggy-lamps faint, but around a farm in the
   valley which everyone knew from the account must be Nahum's, the
   darkness had been less thick. A dim though distinct luminosity seemed
   to inhere in all the vegetation, grass, leaves, and blossoms alike,
   while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to
   stir furtively in the yard near the barn.

   The grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely
   pastured in the lot near the house, but toward the end of May the milk
   began to be bad. Then Nahum had the cows driven to the uplands, after
   which the trouble ceased. Not long after this the change in grass and
   leaves became apparent to the eye. All the verdure was going grey, and
   was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness. Ammi was now
   the only person who ever visited the place, and his visits were
   becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were
   virtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their
   errands in town. They were failing curiously both physically and
   mentally, and no one was surprised when the news of Mrs. Gardner's
   madness stole around.

   It happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor's fall, and
   the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not
   describe. In her raving there was not a single specific noun, but only
   verbs and pronouns. Things moved and changed and fluttered, and ears
   tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds. Something was taken
   away--she was being drained of something--something was fastening
   itself on her that ought not to be--someone must make it keep
   off--nothing was ever still in the night--the walls and windows
   shifted. Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her
   wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and
   others. Even when her expression changed he did nothing. But when the
   boys grew afraid of her, and Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she
   made faces at him, he decided to keep her locked in the attic. By July
   she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours, and before that month
   was over Nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the
   dark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation.

   It was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something
   had aroused them in the night, and their neighing and kicking in their
   stalls had been terrible. There seemed virtually nothing to do to calm
   them, and when Nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like
   frightened woodland deer. It took a week to track all four, and when
   found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable. Something
   had snapped in their brains, and each one had to be shot for its own
   good. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but found it
   would not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in the
   end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used
   their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for
   convenient pitching. And all the while the vegetation was turning grey
   and brittle. Even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were
   greying now, and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and
   tasteless. The asters and golden-rod bloomed grey and distorted, and
   the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such
   blasphemous-looking things that Nahum's oldest boy Zenas cut them down.
   The strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that
   had left their hives and taken to the woods.

   By September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder,
   and Nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of
   the soil. His wife now had spells of terrific screaming, and he and the
   boys were in a constant state of nervous tension. They shunned people
   now, and when school opened the boys did not go. But it was Ammi, on
   one of his rare visits, who first realised that the well water was no
   longer good. It had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid nor
   exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig another well on
   higher ground to use till the soil was good again. Nahum, however,
   ignored the warning, for he had by that time become calloused to
   strange and unpleasant things. He and the boys continued to use the
   tainted supply, drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate
   their meagre and ill-cooked meals and did their thankless and
   monotonous chores through the aimless days. There was something of
   stolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another
   world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom.

   Thaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone
   with a pail and had come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his
   arms, and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about
   "the moving colours down there." Two in one family was pretty bad, but
   Nahum was very brave about it. He let the boy run about for a week
   until he began stumbling and hurting himself, and then he shut him in
   an attic room across the hall from his mother's. The way they screamed
   at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible,
   especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some terrible
   language that was not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully
   imaginative, and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of
   the brother who had been his greatest playmate.

   Almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced.
   Poultry turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found
   dry and noisome upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly
   began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their
   meat was of course useless, and Nahum was at his wit's end. No rural
   veterinary would approach his place, and the city veterinary from
   Arkham was openly baffled. The swine began growing grey and brittle and
   falling to pieces before they died, and their eyes and muzzles
   developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for they had
   never been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the
   cows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily
   shrivelled or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations
   were common. In the last stages--and death was always the result--there
   would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs.
   There could be no question of poison, for all the cases occurred in a
   locked and undisturbed barn. No bites of prowling things could have
   brought the virus, for what live beast of earth can pass through solid
   obstacles? It must be only natural disease--yet what disease could
   wreak such results was beyond any mind's guessing. When the harvest
   came there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock and
   poultry were dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three in
   number, had all vanished one night and were never heard of again. The
   five cats had left some time before, but their going was scarcely
   noticed since there now seemed to be no mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had
   made pets of the graceful felines.

   On the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi's house with
   hideous news. The death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room,
   and it had come in a way which could not be told. Nahum had dug a grave
   in the railed family plot behind the farm, and had put therein what he
   found. There could have been nothing from outside, for the small barred
   window and locked door were intact; but it was much as it had been in
   the barn. Ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they
   could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror seemed to cling round
   the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence of one in the
   house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable. Ammi accompanied
   Nahum home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he might to calm
   the hysterical sobbing of little Merwin. Zenas needed no calming. He
   had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his
   father told him; and Ammi thought that his fate was very merciful. Now
   and then Merwin's screams were answered faintly from the attic, and in
   response to an inquiring look Nahum said that his wife was getting very
   feeble. When night approached, Ammi managed to get away; for not even
   friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the
   vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind.
   It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more imaginative. Even as
   things were, his mind was bent ever so slightly; but had he been able
   to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must
   inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the twilight he hastened
   home, the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing
   horribly in his ears.

   Three days later Nahum lurched into Ammi's kitchen in the early
   morning, and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale
   once more, while Mrs. Pierce listened in a clutching fright. It was
   little Merwin this time. He was gone. He had gone out late at night
   with a lantern and pail for water, and had never come back. He'd been
   going to pieces for days, and hardly knew what he was about. Screamed
   at everything. There had been a frantic shriek from the yard then, but
   before the father could get to the door the boy was gone. There was no
   glow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace.
   At the time Nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when
   dawn came, and the man had plodded back from his all-night search of
   the woods and fields, he had found some very curious things near the
   well. There was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron
   which had certainly been the lantern; while a bent bail and twisted
   iron hoops beside it, both half-fused, seemed to hint at the remnants
   of the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was
   blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could
   give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling
   the people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in
   telling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was
   gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and
   waiting to be seen and felt and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he
   wanted Ammi to look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It
   must all be a judgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what
   for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord's ways so far as
   he knew.

   For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about
   what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner
   place a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a
   moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the
   whole farm was shocking--greyish withered grass and leaves on the
   ground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and
   gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a
   studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some
   subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after
   all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but
   perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room
   was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily
   to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the
   cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing
   about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently Nahum
   asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable, and then
   Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at last, and
   the hapless farmer's mind was proof against more sorrow.

   Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the
   missing Zenas. "In the well--he lives in the well--" was all that the
   clouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor's mind
   a sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry.
   "Nabby? Why, here she is!" was the surprised response of poor Nahum,
   and Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself. Leaving the harmless
   babbler on the couch, he took the keys from their nail beside the door
   and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close and
   noisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of
   the four doors in sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried
   various keys on the ring he had taken. The third key proved the right
   one, and after some fumbling Ammi threw open the low white door.

   It was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured by
   the crude wooden bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the
   wide-planked floor. The stench was beyond enduring, and before
   proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with
   his lungs filled with breathable air. When he did enter he saw
   something dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more clearly he
   screamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud
   eclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if
   by some hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his
   eyes; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of
   the globule in the meteor that the geologist's hammer had shattered,
   and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring. As it was
   he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him,
   and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young
   Thaddeus and the livestock. But the terrible thing about this horror
   was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to
   crumble.

   Ammi would give me no added particulars to this scene, but the shape in
   the corner does not reappear in his tale as a moving object. There are
   things which cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common humanity
   is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no moving thing
   was left in that attic room, and that to leave anything capable of
   motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any
   accountable being to eternal torment. Anyone but a stolid farmer would
   have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked conscious through that low
   doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him. There would be Nahum
   to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and removed to some place
   where he could be cared for.

   Commencing his descent of the dark stairs. Ammi heard a thud below him.
   He even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled
   nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful
   room above. What presence had his cry and entry started up? Halted by
   some vague fear, he heard still further sounds below. Indubitably there
   was a sort of heavy dragging, and a most detestably sticky noise as of
   some fiendish and unclean species of suction. With an associative sense
   goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably of what he had
   seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this into which
   he had blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward, but stood
   there trembling at the black curve of the boxed-in staircase. Every
   trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain. The sounds, the sense
   of dread expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow
   steps--and merciful Heaven!--the faint but unmistakable luminosity of
   all the woodwork in sight; steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams
   alike!

   Then there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi's horse outside,
   followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In
   another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot, leaving the
   frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them. But that
   was not all. There had been another sound out there. A sort of liquid
   splash--water--it must have been the well. He had left Hero untied near
   it, and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a
   stone. And still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably
   ancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it built before
   1670, and the gambrel roof not later than 1730.

   A feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and
   Ammi's grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic
   for some purpose. Slowly nerving himself, he finished his descent and
   walked boldly toward the kitchen. But he did not complete the walk,
   because what he sought was no longer there. It had come to meet him,
   and it was still alive after a fashion. Whether it had crawled or
   whether it had been dragged by any external force, Ammi could not say;
   but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in the last
   half-hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far
   advanced. There was a horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were
   scaling off. Ammi could not touch it, but looked horrifiedly into the
   distorted parody that had been a face. "What was it, Nahum--what was
   it?" he whispered, and the cleft, bulging lips were just able to
   crackle out a final answer.

   "Nothin' . . . nothin' . . . the colour . . . it burns . . . cold an'
   wet, but it burns . . . it lived in the well . . . I seen it . . . a
   kind of smoke . . . jest like the flowers last spring . . . the well

   said so . . . he was right . . . look out, Ammi, it'll do suthin'
   more . . . sucks the life out. . . ."

   But that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had
   completely caved in. Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was
   left and reeled out the back door into the fields. He climbed the slope
   to the ten-acre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the
   woods. He could not pass that well from which his horse had run away.
   He had looked at it through the window, and had seen that no stone was
   missing from the rim. Then the lurching buggy had not dislodged
   anything after all--the splash had been something else--something which
   went into the well after it had done with poor Nahum.

   When Ammi reached his house the horse and buggy had arrived before him
   and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without
   explanations, he set out at once for Arkham and notified the
   authorities that the Gardner family was no more. He indulged in no
   details, but merely told of the deaths of Nahum and Nabby, that of
   Thaddeus being already known, and mentioned that the cause seemed to be
   the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock. He also stated
   that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable
   questioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled to
   take three officers to the Gardner farm, together with the coroner, the
   medical examiner, and the veterinary who had treated the diseased
   animals. He went much against his will, for the afternoon was advancing
   and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place, but it was
   some comfort to have so many people with him.

   The six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi's buggy, and
   arrived at the pest-ridden farmhouse about four o'clock. Used as the
   officers were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at what
   was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the
   floor below. The whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was
   terrible enough, but those two crumbling objects were beyond all
   bounds. No one could look long at them, and even the medical examiner
   admitted that there was very little to examine. Specimens could be
   analysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining them--and here
   it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college
   laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken. Under the
   spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many
   of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange
   meteor had yielded in the previous year. The property of emitting this
   spectrum vanished in a month, the dust thereafter consisting mainly of
   alkaline phosphates and carbonates.

   Ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they
   meant to do anything then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and
   he was anxious to be away. But he could not help glancing nervously at
   the stony curb by the great sweep, and when a detective questioned him
   he admitted that Nahum had feared something down there--so much so that
   he had never even thought of searching it for Merwin or Zenas. After
   that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well
   immediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of
   rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside.
   The men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their
   noses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a job
   as they had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally low.
   There is no need to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin and
   Zenas were both there, in part, though the vestiges were mainly
   skeletal. There were also a small deer and a large dog in about the
   same state, and a number of bones of smaller animals. The ooze and
   slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a man
   who descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink
   the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting
   any solid obstruction.

   Twilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house.
   Then, when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the
   well, everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room
   while the intermittent light of a spectral half-moon played wanly on
   the grey desolation outside. The men were frankly nonplussed by the
   entire case, and could find no convincing common element to link the
   strange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of livestock and
   humans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the tainted
   well. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not
   believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt
   the meteor had poisoned the soil, but the illness of persons and
   animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter.
   Was it the well water? Very possibly. It might be a good idea to
   analyze it. But what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump
   into the well? Their deeds were so similar--and the fragments shewed
   that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death. Why was
   everything so grey and brittle?

   It was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who
   first noticed the glow about the well. Night had fully set in, and all
   the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful
   moonbeams; but this new glow was something definite and distinct, and
   appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a
   searchlight, giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where
   the water had been emptied. It had a very queer colour, and as all the
   men clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this
   strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had
   seen that colour before, and feared to think what it might mean. He had
   seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aërolite two summers ago,
   had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime, and had thought
   he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small
   barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had
   happened. It had flashed there a second, and a clammy and hateful
   current of vapour had brushed past him--and then poor Nahum had been
   taken by something of that colour. He had said so at the last--said it
   was like the globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway in
   the yard and the splash in the well--and now that well was belching
   forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint.

   It does credit to the alertness of Ammi's mind that he puzzled even at
   that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific. He
   could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a
   vapour glimpsed in the daytime, against a window opening on the morning
   sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist
   against the black and blasted landscape. It wasn't right--it was
   against Nature--and he thought of those terrible last words of his
   stricken friend, "It come from some place whar things ain't as they is
   here . . . one o' them professors said so. . . ."

   All three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the
   road, were now neighing and pawing frantically. The wagon driver
   started for the door to do something, but Ammi laid a shaky hand on his
   shoulder. "Dun't go out thar," he whispered. "They's more to this nor
   what we know. Nahum said somethin' lived in the well that sucks your
   life out. He said it must be some'at growed from a round ball like one
   we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago June. Sucks an'
   burns, he said, an' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar
   now, that ye can hardly see an' can't tell what it is. Nahum thought it
   feeds on everything livin' an' gits stronger all the time. He said he
   seen it this last week. It must be somethin' from away off in the sky
   like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was. The
   way it's made an' the way it works ain't like no way o' God's world.
   It's some'at from beyond."

   So the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger
   and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was
   truly an awful moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house
   itself, four monstrous sets of fragments--two from the house and two
   from the well--in the woodshed behind, and that shaft of unknown and
   unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front. Ammi had restrained
   the driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured he himself was after
   the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room, but
   perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever
   know what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond
   had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind, there is no telling
   what it might not have done at that last moment, and with its seemingly
   increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to
   display beneath the half-clouded moonlit sky.

   All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp
   gasp. The others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own gaze
   upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly
   arrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in
   country gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the thing
   which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on, that the
   strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary to
   premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did
   arise not long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the
   dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the
   fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And
   yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees
   in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and
   spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the
   moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked
   by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors
   writhing and struggling below the black roots.

   Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth
   passed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded
   out momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe, but
   husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had not
   faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness
   the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny
   points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like the
   fire of St. Elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles' heads at
   Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a
   glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an
   accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which
   Ammi had come to recognize and dread. All the while the shaft of
   phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter,
   bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a sense of doom and
   abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could
   form. It was no longer shining out, it was pouring out; and as the
   shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow
   directly into the sky.

   The veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy
   extra bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for
   lack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the
   growing luminosity of the trees. The neighing and stamping of the
   horses had become utterly frightful, but not a soul of that group in
   the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward. With
   the moments the shining of the trees increased, while their restless
   branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood of
   the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly
   pointed to some wooden sheds and bee-hives near the stone wall on the
   west. They were commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles
   of the visitors seemed so far unaffected. Then there was a wild
   commotion and clopping in the road, and as Ammi quenched the lamp for
   better seeing they realized that the span of frantic greys had broke
   their sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon.

   The shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers
   were exchanged. "It spreads on everything organic that's been around
   here," muttered the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who
   had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred
   up something intangible. "It was awful," he added. "There was no bottom
   at all. Just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking
   under there." Ammi's horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the
   road outside, and nearly drowned its owner's faint quaver as he mumbled
   his formless reflections. "It come from that stone . . . it growed down
   thar . . . it got everything livin' . . . it fed itself on 'em, mind
   and body . . . Thad an' Mernie, Zenas an' Nabby . . . Nahum was the
   last . . . they all drunk the water . . . it got strong on 'em . . . it
   come from beyond, whar things ain't like they be here . . . now it's
   goin' home. . . ."

   At this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger
   and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which
   each spectator later described differently, there came from poor
   tethered Hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a
   horse. Every person in that low-pitched sitting room stopped his ears,
   and Ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea. Words could
   not convey it--when Ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled
   inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy.
   That was the last of Hero till they buried him next day. But the
   present was no time to mourn, for almost at this instant a detective
   silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with
   them. In the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint
   phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment. It glowed on
   the broad-planked floor and the fragment of rag carpet, and shimmered
   over the sashes of the small-paned windows. It ran up and down the
   exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the shelf and mantel, and
   infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it strengthen,
   and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave
   that house.

   Ammi shewed them the back door and the path up through the fields to
   the ten-acre pasture. They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did
   not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground. They
   were glad of the path, for they could not have gone the front way, by
   that well. It was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds, and
   those shining orchard trees with their gnarled, fiendish contours; but
   thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up. The moon
   went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge
   over Chapman's Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open
   meadows.

   When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place
   at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining with
   the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such
   grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey
   brittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues
   of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were
   creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn and sheds. It was a
   scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot
   of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of
   cryptic poison from the well--seething, feeling, lapping, reaching,
   scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and
   unrecognizable chromaticism.

   Then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the
   sky like a rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing
   through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man
   could gasp or cry out. No watcher can ever forget that sight, and Ammi
   stared blankly at the stars of Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the
   others, where the unknown colour had melted into the Milky Way. But his
   gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in
   the valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and crackling, and
   not an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the outcome
   was the same, for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up
   from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of
   unnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw
   it, and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such
   coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown.
   Through quickly re-closing vapours they followed the great morbidity
   that had vanished, and in another second they had vanished too. Behind
   and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return, and
   all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black,
   frore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked and howled, and lashed
   the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy, till soon the
   trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to
   shew what was left down there at Nahum's.

   Too awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back
   toward Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows, and
   begged them to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of keeping
   straight on to town. He did not wish to cross the blighted,
   wind-whipped woods alone to his home on the main road. For he had had
   an added shock that the others were spared, and was crushed forever
   with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come.
   As the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set
   their faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the
   shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred
   friend. And from that stricken, far-away spot he had seen something
   feebly rise, only to sink down again upon the place from which the
   great shapeless horror had shot into the sky. It was just a colour--but
   not any colour of our earth or heavens. And because Ammi recognized
   that colour, and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down
   there in the well, he has never been quite right since.

   Ammi would never go near the place again. It is forty-four years now
   since the horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be
   glad when the new reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I
   do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of
   that abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will always be very
   deep--but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think I shall visit
   the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with Ammi
   returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were
   not any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the
   cellar, some mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim of
   that nefandous well. Save for Ammi's dead horse, which they towed away
   and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him,
   everything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of
   dusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever grown there since. To
   this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in
   the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in
   spite of the rural tales have named it "the blasted heath."

   The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and
   college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from
   that disused well, or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to
   disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the
   borders of that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion
   that the blight is spreading--little by little, perhaps an inch a year.
   People say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in
   the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter
   snow. Snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is
   elsewhere. Horses--the few that are left in this motor age--grow
   skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs
   too near the splotch of greyish dust.

   They say the mental influences are very bad, too; numbers went queer in
   the years after Nahum's taking, and always they lacked the power to get
   away. Then the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the
   foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads. They could
   not stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours
   their wild, weird stories of whispered magic have given them. Their
   dreams at night, they protest, are very horrible in that grotesque
   country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a
   morbid fancy. No traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in
   those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose
   mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye. I myself am curious
   about the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told me
   his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would
   gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept
   into my soul.

   Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know--that is all. There was no
   one but Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the
   strange days, and all three professors who saw the aërolite and its
   coloured globule are dead. There were other globules--depend upon that.
   One must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another
   which was too late. No doubt it is still down the well--I know there
   was something wrong with the sunlight I saw above that miasmal brink.
   The rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there is a
   kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever demon hatchling is
   there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly
   spread. Is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air?
   One of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move
   as they ought not to do at night.

   What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi
   described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that are not
   of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on
   the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories. This was
   no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers
   measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of
   space--a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond
   all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the
   brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open
   before our frenzied eyes.

   I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think
   his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned.
   Something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor, and
   something terrible--though I know not in what proportion--still
   remains. I shall be glad to see the water come. Meanwhile I hope
   nothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thing--and its
   influence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away?
   How clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum's--"Can't git
   away . . . draws ye . . . ye know summ'at's comin' but tain't no
   use. . . ." Ammi is such a good old man--when the reservoir gang gets
   to work I must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him. I
   would hate to think of him as the grey, twisted, brittle monstrosity
   which persists more and more in troubling my sleep.

   8831The Crawling ChaosH. P. Lovecraft

   Of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written. The
   ecstasies and horrors of De Quincey and the paradis artificiels of
   Baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them
   immortal, and the world knows well the beauty, the terror and the
   mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is
   transported. But much as has been told, no man has yet dared intimate
   the nature of the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind, or hint at the
   direction of the unheard-of roads along whose ornate and exotic course
   the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne. De Quincey was drawn
   back into Asia, that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous
   antiquity is so impressive that "the vast age of the race and name
   overpowers the sense of youth in the individual," but farther than that
   he dared not go. Those who have gone farther seldom returned, and even
   when they have, they have been either silent or quite mad. I took opium
   but once -- in the year of the plague, when doctors sought to deaden
   the agonies they could not cure. There was an overdose -- my physician
   was worn out with horror and exertion -- and I travelled very far
   indeed. In the end I returned and lived, but my nights are filled with
   strange memories, nor have I ever permitted a doctor to give me opium
   again.

   The pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the
   drug was administered, Of the future I had no heed; to escape, whether
   by cure, unconsciousness, or death, was all that concerned me. I was
   partly delirious, so that it is hard to place the exact moment of
   transition, but I think the effect must have begun shortly before the
   pounding ceased to be painful. As I have said, there was an overdose;
   so my reactions were probably far from normal. The sensation of
   falling, curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction,
   was paramount; though there was subsidiary impression of unseen throngs
   in incalculable profusion, throngs of infinitely di-verse nature, but
   all more or less related to me. Sometimes it seemed less as though I
   were falling, than as though the universe or the ages were falling past
   me. Suddenly my pain ceased, and I began to associate the pounding with
   an external rather than internal force. The falling had ceased also,
   giving place to a sensation of uneasy, temporary rest; and when I
   listened closely, I fancied the pounding was that of the vast,
   inscrutable sea as its sinister, colossal breakers lacerated some
   desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude. Then I opened my
   eyes. For a moment my surroundings seemed confused, like a projected
   image hopelessly out of focus, but gradually I realised my solitary
   presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows. Of
   the exact nature of the apartment I could form no idea, for my thoughts
   were still far from settled, but I noticed van-coloured rugs and
   draperies, elaborately fashioned tables, chairs, ottomans, and divans,
   and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the
   exotic without being actually alien. These things I noticed, yet they
   were not long uppermost in my mind. Slowly but inexorably crawling upon
   my consciousness and rising above every other impression, came a
   dizzying fear of the unknown; a fear all the greater because I could
   not analyse it, and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menace;
   not death, but some nameless, unheard-of thing inexpressibly more
   ghastly and abhorrent. Presently I realised that the direct symbol and
   excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant
   reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain. It
   seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which I
   stood, and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images.
   I felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the silk-hung
   walls, and shrank from glancing through the arched, latticed windows
   that opened so bewilderingly on every hand. Perceiving shutters
   attached to these windows, I closed them all, averting my eyes from the
   exterior as I did so. Then, employing a flint and steel which I found
   on one of the small tables, I lit the many candles reposing about the
   walls in arabesque sconces. The added sense of security brought by
   closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree,
   but I could not shut out the monotonous pounding. Now that I was
   calmer, the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful, and I felt a
   contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful
   shrinking. Opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the
   pounding, I beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a
   carven door and large oriel window. To this window I was irresistibly
   drawn, though my ill-defined apprehensions seemed almost equally bent
   on holding me back. As I approached it I could see a chaotic whirl of
   waters in the distance. Then, as I attained it and glanced out on all
   sides, the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with
   full and devastating force.

   I beheld such a sight as I had never beheld before, and which no living
   person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of
   opium. The building stood on a narrow point of land -- or what was now
   a narrow point of land -- fully three hundred feet above what must
   lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters. On either side of the
   house there fell a newly washed-out precipice of red earth, whilst
   ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully, eating
   away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation. Out a mile or
   more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in
   height, and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque
   contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures. The waves
   were dark and purplish, almost black, and clutched at the yielding red
   mud of the bank as if with uncouth, greedy hands. I could not but feel
   that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon
   all the solid ground, perhaps abetted by the angry sky.

   Recovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural
   spectacle had thrown me, I realized that my actual physical danger was
   acute. Even whilst I gazed, the bank had lost many feet, and it could
   not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit
   of lashing waves. Accordingly I hastened to the opposite side of the
   edifice, and finding a door, emerged at once, locking it after me with
   a curious key which had hung inside. I now beheld more of the strange
   region about me, and marked a singular division which seemed to exist
   in the hostile ocean and firmament. On each side of the jutting
   promontory different conditions held sway. At my left as I faced inland
   was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in
   under a brightly shining sun. Something about that sun's nature and
   position made me shudder, but I could not then tell, and cannot tell
   now, what it was. At my right also was the sea, but it was blue, calm,
   and only gently undulating, while the sky above it was darker and the
   washed-out bank more nearly white than reddish. I now turned my
   attention to the land, and found occasion for fresh surprise; for the
   vegetation resembled nothing I had ever seen or read about. It was
   apparently tropical or at least sub-tropical -- a conclusion borne out
   by the intense heat of the air. Sometimes I thought I could trace
   strange analogies with the flora of my native land, fancying that the
   well-known plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical
   change of climate; but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were
   plainly foreign. The house I had just left was very small -- hardly
   more than a cottage -- but its material was evidently marble, and its
   architecture was weird and composite, involving a quaint fusion of
   Western and Eastern forms. At the corners were Corinthian columns, but
   the red tile roof was like that of a Chinese pagoda. From the door
   inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand, about four feet
   wide, and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable
   flowering shrubs and plants. It lay toward the side of the promontory
   where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish. Down this path I
   felt impelled to flee, as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the
   pounding ocean. At first it was slightly uphill, then I reached a
   gentle crest. Behind me I saw the scene I had left; the entire point
   with the cottage and the black water, with the green sea on one side
   and the blue sea on the other, and a curse unnamed and unnamable
   lowering over all. I never saw it again, and often wonder.... After
   this last look I strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before
   me.

   The path, as I have intimated, ran along the right-hand shore as one
   went inland. Ahead and to the left I now viewed a magnificent valley
   comprising thousands of acres, and covered with a swaying growth of
   tropical grass higher than my head. Almost at the limit of vision was a
   colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me. By this
   time wonder and' escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely
   dissipated my fear, but as I paused and sank fatigued to the path, idly
   digging with my hands into the warm, whitish-golden sand, a new and
   acute sense of danger seized me. Some terror in the swishing tall grass
   seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea, and I started up
   crying aloud and disjointedly, "Tiger? Tiger? Is it Tiger? Beast?
   Beast? Is it a Beast that I am afraid of?" My mind wandered back to an
   ancient and classical story of tigers which I had read; I strove to
   recall the author, but had difficulty. Then in the midst of my fear I
   remembered that the tale was by Rudyard Kipling; nor did the
   grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me; I wished
   for the volume containing this story, and had almost started back
   toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the
   lure of the palm prevented me.

   Whether or not I could have resisted the backward beckoning without the
   counter-fascination of the vast palm tree, I do not know. This
   attraction was now dominant, and I left the path and crawled on hands
   and knees down the valley's slope despite my fear of the grass and of
   the serpents it might contain. I resolved to fight for life and reason
   as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land, though I
   sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses
   joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant
   breakers. I would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for
   relief, but could never quite shut out the detestable sound. It was, as
   it seemed to me, only after ages that I finally dragged myself to the
   beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shade.

   There now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the
   opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror; incidents which I tremble to
   recall and dare not seek to interpret. No sooner had I crawled beneath
   the overhanging foliage of the palm, than there dropped from its
   branches a young child of such beauty as I never beheld before. Though
   ragged and dusty, this being bore the features of a faun or demigod,
   and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the
   tree. It smiled and extended its hand, but before I could arise and
   speak I heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing; notes
   high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness. The sun
   had by this time sunk below the horizon, and in the twilight I saw an
   aureole of lambent light encircled the child's head. Then in a tone of
   silver it addressed me: "It is the end. They have come down through the
   gloaming from the stars. Now all is over, and beyond the Arinurian
   streams we shall dwell blissfully in Teloe. " As the child spoke, I
   beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree, and rising,
   greeted a pair whom I knew to be the chief singers among those I had
   heard. A god and goddess they must have been, for such beauty is not
   mortal; and they took my hands, saying, "Come, child, you have heard
   the voices, and all is well. In Teloe beyond the Milky Way and the
   Arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony. And upon
   their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful
   stars. Under the ivory bridges of Teloe flow rivers of liquid gold
   bearing pleasure-barges bound for blossomy Cytharion of the Seven Suns.
   And in Teloe and Cytharion abide only youth, beauty, and pleasure, nor
   are any sounds heard, save of laughter, song, and the lute. Only the
   gods dwell in Teloe of the golden rivers, but among them shalt thou
   dwell."

   As I listened, enchanted, I suddenly became aware of a change in my
   surroundings. The palm tree, so lately overshadowing my exhausted form,
   was now some distance to my left and considerably below me. I was
   obviously floating in the atmosphere; companioned not only by the
   strange child and the radiant pair, but by a constantly increasing
   throng of half-luminous, vine-crowned youths and maidens with
   wind-blown hair and joyful countenance. We slowly ascended together, as
   if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from
   the golden nebulae, and the child whispered in my ear that I must look
   always upward to the pathways of light, and never backward to the
   sphere I had just left. The youths and maidens now chanted mellifluous
   choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes, and I felt enveloped in a
   peace and happiness more profound than any I had in life imagined, when
   the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my
   soul. Through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists,
   as if in mocking, daemoniac concord, throbbed from gulfs below the
   damnable, the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean. As those black
   breakers beat their message into my ears I forgot the words of the
   child and looked back, down upon the doomed scene from which I thought
   I had escaped.

   Down through the aether I saw the accursed earth slowly turning, ever
   turning, with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate
   shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted
   cities. And under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights I can never
   describe, sights I can never forget; deserts of corpselike clay and
   jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains
   and villages of my native land, and maelstroms of frothing ocean where
   once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers. Round the northern pole
   steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours, hissing before
   the onslaught of the ever-mounting waves that curled and fretted from
   the shuddering deep. Then a rending report clave the night, and athwart
   the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift. Still the black ocean
   foamed and gnawed, eating away the desert on either side as the rift in
   the center widened and widened. There was now no land left but the
   desert, and still the fuming ocean ate and ate. All at once I thought
   even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something, afraid of dark gods
   of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters, but
   even if it was it could not turn back; and the desert had suffered too
   much from those nightmare waves to help them now. So the ocean ate the
   last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf, thereby giving up
   all it had ever conquered. From the new-flooded lands it flowed again,
   uncovering death and decay; and from its ancient and immemorial bed it
   trickled loathsomely, uncovering nighted secrets of the years when Time
   was young and the gods unborn. Above the waves rose weedy remembered
   spires. The moon laid pale lilies of light on dead London, and Paris
   stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with star-dust. Then rose
   spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered; terrible
   spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were lands. There was
   not any pounding now, but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of
   waters tumbling into the rift. The smoke of that rift had changed to
   steam, and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser. It seared
   my face and hands, and when I looked to see how it affected my
   companions I found they had all disappeared. Then very suddenly it
   ended, and I knew no more till I awaked upon a bed of convalescence. As
   the cloud of steam from the Plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire
   surface from my sight, all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of
   mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether. In one delirious
   flash and burst it happened; one blinding, deafening holocaust of fire,
   smoke, and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to
   the void.

   And when the smoke cleared away, and I sought to look upon the earth, I
   beheld against the background of cold, humorous stars only the dying
   sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister.

   86723The Curse of YigH. P. Lovecraft and Zealia Bishop

   In 1925 I went into Oklahoma looking for snake lore, and I came out
   with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life. I admit it
   is foolish, since there are natural explanations for everything I saw
   and heard, but it masters me none the less. If the old story had been
   all there was to it, I would not have been so badly shaken. My work as
   an American Indian ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of
   extravagant legendry, and I know that simple white people can beat the
   redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions. But I
   can't forget what I saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in
   Guthrie.

   I called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me I
   would find something important there. Neither Indians nor white men
   would discuss the snake-god legends I had come to trace. The oil-boom
   newcomers, of course, knew nothing of such matters, and the red men and
   old pioneers were plainly frightened when I spoke of them. Not more
   than six or seven people mentioned the asylum, and those who did were
   careful to talk in whispers. But the whisperers said that Dr. McNeill
   could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all I wanted to know.
   He could explain why Yig, the half-human father of serpents, is a
   shunned and feared object in central Oklahoma, and why old settlers
   shiver at the secret Indian orgies which make the autumn days and
   nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely places.

   It was with the scent of a hound on the trail that I went to Guthrie,
   for I had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of
   serpent-worship among the Indians. I had always felt, from well-defined
   undertones of legend and archaeology, that great Quetzalcoatl--benign
   snake-god of the Mexicans--had had an older and darker prototype; and
   during recent months I had well-nigh proved it in a series of
   researches stretching from Guatemala to the Oklahoma plains. But
   everything was tantalising and incomplete, for above the border the
   cult of the snake was hedged about by fear and furtiveness.

   Now it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to
   dawn, and I sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness I did not
   try to cloak. Dr. McNeill was a small, clean-shaven man of somewhat
   advanced years, and I saw at once from his speech and manner that he
   was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his
   profession. Grave and doubtful when I first made known my errand, his
   face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the
   letter of introduction which a kindly old ex-Indian agent had given me.

   "So you've been studying the Yig legend, eh?" he reflected
   sententiously. "I know that many of our Oklahoma ethnologists have
   tried to connect it with Quetzalcoatl, but I don't think any of them
   have traced the intermediate steps so well. You've done remarkable work
   for a man as young as you seem to be, and you certainly deserve all the
   data we can give.

   "I don't suppose old Major Moore or any of the others told you what it
   is I have here. They don't like to talk about it, and neither do I. It
   is very tragic and very horrible, but that is all. I refuse to consider
   it anything supernatural. There's a story about it that I'll tell you
   after you see it--a devilish sad story, but one that I won't call
   magic. It merely shews the potency that belief has over some people.
   I'll admit there are times when I feel a shiver that's more than
   physical, but in daylight I set all that down to nerves. I'm not a
   young fellow any more, alas!

   "To come to the point, the thing I have is what you might call a victim
   of Yig's curse--a physically living victim. We don't let the bulk of
   the nurses see it, although most of them know it's here. There are just
   two steady old chaps whom I let feed it and clean out its
   quarters--used to be three, but good old Stevens passed on a few years
   ago. I suppose I'll have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the
   thing doesn't seem to age or change much, and we old boys can't last
   forever. Maybe the ethics of the near future will let us give it a
   merciful release, but it's hard to tell.

   "Did you see that single ground-glass basement window over in the east
   wing when you came up the drive? That's where it is. I'll take you
   there myself now. You needn't make any comment. Just look through the
   moveable panel in the door and thank God the light isn't any stronger.
   Then I'll tell you the story--or as much as I've been able to piece
   together."

   We walked downstairs very quietly, and did not talk as we threaded the
   corridors of the seemingly deserted basement. Dr. McNeill unlocked a
   grey-painted steel door, but it was only a bulkhead leading to a
   further stretch of hallway. At length he paused before a door marked B
   116, opened a small observation panel which he could use only by
   standing on tiptoe, and pounded several times upon the painted metal,
   as if to arouse the occupant, whatever it might be.

   A faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it, and I
   fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low, hissing response. Finally
   he motioned me to replace him at the peep-hole, and I did so with a
   causeless and increasing tremor. The barred, ground-glass window, close
   to the earth outside, admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor; and
   I had to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before I
   could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the straw-covered
   floor, emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss. Then the
   shadowed outlines began to take shape, and I perceived that the
   squirming entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat
   on its belly. I clutched at the door-handle for support as I tried to
   keep from fainting.

   The moving object was almost of human size, and entirely devoid of
   clothing. It was absolutely hairless, and its tawny-looking back seemed
   subtly squamous in the dim, ghoulish light. Around the shoulders it was
   rather speckled and brownish, and the head was very curiously flat. As
   it looked up to hiss at me I saw that the beady little black eyes were
   damnably anthropoid, but I could not bear to study them long. They
   fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence, so that I closed
   the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in
   its matted straw and spectral twilight. I must have reeled a bit, for I
   saw that the doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away. I
   was stuttering over and over again: "B-but for God's sake, what is it?"

   Dr. McNeill told me the story in his private office as I sprawled
   opposite him in an easy-chair. The gold and crimson of late afternoon
   changed to the violet of early dusk, but still I sat awed and
   motionless. I resented every ring of the telephone and every whir of
   the buzzer, and I could have cursed the nurses and internes whose
   knocks now and then summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office.
   Night came, and I was glad my host switched on all the lights.
   Scientist though I was, my zeal for research was half forgotten amidst
   such breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when
   whispered witch-tales go the rounds of the chimney-corner.

   It seems that Yig, the snake-god of the central plains
   tribes--presumably the primal source of the more southerly Quetzalcoatl
   or Kukulcan--was an odd, half-anthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary
   and capricious nature. He was not wholly evil, and was usually quite
   well-disposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his
   children, the serpents; but in the autumn he became abnormally
   ravenous, and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites. That
   was why the tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo country pounded
   ceaselessly week in and week out in August, September, and October; and
   why the medicine-men made strange noises with rattles and whistles
   curiously like those of the Aztecs and Mayas.

   Yig's chief trait was a relentless devotion to his children--a devotion
   so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the
   venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region. Frightful clandestine
   tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked
   harm upon his wriggling progeny; his chosen method being to turn his
   victim, after suitable tortures, to a spotted snake.

   In the old days of the Indian Territory, the doctor went on, there was
   not quite so much secrecy about Yig. The plains tribes, less cautious
   than the desert nomads and Pueblos, talked quite freely of their
   legends and autumn ceremonies with the first Indian agents, and let
   considerable of the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of
   white settlement. The great fear came in the land-rush days of '89,
   when some extraordinary incidents had been rumoured, and the rumours
   sustained, by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs. Indians said
   that the new white men did not know how to get on with Yig, and
   afterward the settlers came to take that theory at face value. Now no
   old-timer in middle Oklahoma, white or red, could be induced to breathe
   a word about the snake-god except in vague hints. Yet after all, the
   doctor added with almost needless emphasis, the only truly
   authenticated horror had been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of
   bewitchment. It was all very material and cruel--even that last phase
   which had caused so much dispute.

   Dr. McNeill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his
   special story, and I felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre
   curtain rises. The thing had begun when Walker Davis and his wife
   Audrey left Arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the
   spring of 1889, and the end had come in the country of the
   Wichitas--north of the Wichita River, in what is at present Caddo
   County. There is a small village called Binger there now, and the
   railway goes through; but otherwise the place is less changed than
   other parts of Oklahoma. It is still a section of farms and
   ranches--quite productive in these days--since the great oil-fields do
   not come very close.

   Walker and Audrey had come from Franklin County in the Ozarks with a
   canvas-topped wagon, two mules, an ancient and useless dog called
   "Wolf", and all their household goods. They were typical hill-folk,
   youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most, and looked
   forward to a life of better returns for their a hard work than they had
   had in Arkansas. Both were lean, raw-boned specimens; the man tall,
   sandy, and grey-eyed, and the woman short and rather dark, with a black
   straightness of hair suggesting a slight Indian admixture.

   In general, there was very little of distinction about them, and but
   for one thing their annals might not have differed from those of
   thousands of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that
   time. That thing was Walker's almost epileptic fear of snakes, which
   some laid to prenatal causes, and some said came from a dark prophecy
   about his end with which an old Indian squaw had tried to scare him
   when he was small. Whatever the cause, the effect was marked indeed;
   for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake
   would cause him to grow faint and pale, while the sight of even a tiny
   specimen would produce a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion
   seizure.

   The Davises started out early in the year, in the hope of being on
   their new land for the spring ploughing. Travel was slow; for the roads
   were bad in Arkansas, while in the Territory there were great stretches
   of rolling hills and red, sandy barrens without any roads whatever. As
   the terrain grew flatter, the change from their native mountains
   depressed them more, perhaps, than they realised; but they found the
   people at the Indian agencies very affable, while most of the settled
   Indians seemed friendly and civil. Now and then they encountered a
   fellow-pioneer, with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable
   rivalry were generally exchanged.

   Owing to the season, there were not many snakes in evidence, so Walker
   did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness. In the earlier
   stages of the journey, too, there were no Indian snake-legends to
   trouble him; for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not
   share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours. As fate would
   have it, it was a white man at Okmulgee in the Creek country who gave
   the Davises the first hint of Yig beliefs; a hint which had a curiously
   fascinating effect on Walker, and caused him to ask questions very
   freely after that.

   Before long Walker's fascination had developed into a bad case of
   fright. He took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the
   nightly camps, always clearing away whatever vegetation he found, and
   avoiding stony places whenever he could. Every clump of stunted bushes
   and every cleft in the great, slab-like rocks seemed to him now to hide
   malevolent serpents, while every human figure not obviously part of a
   settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snake-god till
   nearness had proved the contrary. Fortunately no troublesome encounters
   came at this stage to shake his nerves still further.

   As they approached the Kickapoo country they found it harder and harder
   to avoid camping near rocks. Finally it was no longer possible, and
   poor Walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some of the
   rustic anti-snake charms he had learned in his boyhood. Two or three
   times a snake was really glimpsed, and these sights did not help the
   sufferer in his efforts to preserve composure.

   On the twenty-second evening of the journey a savage wind made it
   imperative, for the sake of the mules, to camp in as sheltered a spot
   as possible; and Audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a
   cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former
   tributary of the Canadian River. He did not like the rocky cast of the
   place, but allowed himself to be overruled this once; leading the
   animals sullenly toward the protecting slope, which the nature of the
   ground would not allow the wagon to approach.

   Audrey, examining the rocks near the wagon, meanwhile noticed a
   singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog. Seizing a rifle,
   she followed his lead, and presently thanked her stars that she had
   forestalled Walker in her discovery. For there, snugly nested in the
   gap between two boulders, was a sight it would have done him no good to
   see. Visible only as one convoluted expanse, but perhaps comprising as
   many as three or four separate units, was a mass of lazy wriggling
   which could not be other than a brood of new-born rattlesnakes.

   Anxious to save Walker from a trying shock, Audrey did not hesitate to
   act, but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down
   again and again upon the writhing objects. Her own sense of loathing
   was great, but it did not amount to a real fear. Finally she saw that
   her task was done, and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the
   red sand and dry, dead grass near by. She must, she reflected, cover
   the nest up before Walker got back from tethering the mules. Old Wolf,
   tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was, had
   vanished, and she feared he had gone to fetch his master.

   Footsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded. A second more,
   and Walker had seen everything. Audrey made a move to catch him if he
   should faint, but he did no more than sway. Then the look of pure
   fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled
   awe and anger, and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tones.

   "Gawd's sake, Aud, but why'd ye go for to do that? Hain't ye heerd all
   the things they've been tellin' about this snake-devil Yig? Ye'd ought
   to a told me, and we'd a moved on. Don't ye know they's a devil-god
   what gets even if ye hurts his children? What for d'ye think the Injuns
   all dances and beats their drums in the fall about? This land's under a
   curse, I tell ye--nigh every soul we've a-talked to sence we come in's
   said the same. Yig rules here, an' he comes out every fall for to git
   his victims and turn 'em into snakes. Why, Aud, they won't none of them
   Injuns acrost the Canayjin kill a snake for love nor money!

   "Gawd knows what ye done to yourself, gal, a-stompin' out a hull brood
   o' Yig's chillen. He'll git ye, sure, sooner or later, unlessen I kin
   buy a charm offen some o' the Injun medicine-men. He'll git ye, Aud, as
   sure's they's a Gawd in heaven--he'll come outa the night and turn ye
   into a crawlin' spotted snake!"

   All the rest of the journey Walker kept up the frightened reproofs and
   prophecies. They crossed the Canadian near Newcastle, and soon
   afterward met with the first of the real plains Indians they had
   seen--a party of blanketed Wichitas, whose leader talked freely under
   the spell of the whiskey offered him, and taught poor Walker a
   long-winded protective charm against Yig in exchange for a quart bottle
   of the same inspiring fluid. By the end of the week the chosen site in
   the Wichita country was reached, and the Davises made haste to trace
   their boundaries and perform the spring ploughing before even beginning
   the construction of a cabin.

   The region was flat, drearily windy, and sparse of natural vegetation,
   but promised great fertility under cultivation. Occasional outcroppings
   of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone, and here and
   there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground
   like a man-made floor. There seemed to be a very few snakes, or
   possible dens for them; so Audrey at last persuaded Walker to build the
   one-room cabin over a vast, smooth slab of exposed stone. With such a
   flooring and with a good-sized fireplace the wettest weather might be
   defied--though it soon became evident that dampness was no salient
   quality of the district. Logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest
   belt of woods, many miles toward the Wichita Mountains.

   Walker built his wide-chimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of
   some of the other settlers, though the nearest one was over a mile
   away. In turn, he helped his helpers at similar house-raisings, so that
   many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours. There was
   no town worthy the name nearer than El Reno, on the railway thirty
   miles or more to the northeast; and before many weeks had passed, the
   people of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of
   their scattering. The Indians, a few of whom had begun to settle down
   on ranches, were for the most part harmless, though somewhat
   quarrelsome when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to
   them despite all government bans.

   Of all the neighbours the Davises found Joe and Sally Compton, who
   likewise hailed from Arkansas, the most helpful and congenial. Sally is
   still alive, known now as Grandma Compton; and her son Clyde, then an
   infant in arms, has become one of the leading men of the state. Sally
   and Audrey used to visit each other often, for their cabins were only
   two miles apart; and in the long spring and summer afternoons they
   exchanged many a tale of old Arkansas and many a rumour about the new
   country.

   Sally was very sympathetic about Walker's weakness regarding snakes,
   but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness
   which Audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying and
   prophesying about the curse of Yig. She was uncommonly full of gruesome
   snake stories, and produced a direfully strong impression with her
   acknowledged masterpiece--the tale of a man in Scott County who had
   been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once, and had swelled so
   monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop.
   Needless to say, Audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband,
   and she implored the Comptons to beware of starting it on the rounds of
   the countryside. It is to Joe's and Sally's credit that they heeded
   this plea with the utmost fidelity.

   Walker did his corn-planting early, and in midsummer improved his time
   by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region. With the
   help of Joe Compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of very
   good water, though he planned to sink an artesian later on. He did not
   run into many serious snake scares, and made his land as inhospitable
   as possible for wriggling visitors. Every now and then he rode over to
   the cluster of thatched, conical huts which formed the main village of
   the Wichitas, and talked long with the old men and shamans about the
   snake-god and how to nullify his wrath. Charms were always ready in
   exchange for whiskey, but much of the information he got was far from
   reassuring.

   Yig was a great god. He was bad medicine. He did not forget things. In
   the autumn his children were hungry and wild, and Yig was hungry and
   wild, too. All the tribes made medicine against Yig when the corn
   harvest came. They gave him some corn, and danced in proper regalia to
   the sound of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept the drums pounding to
   drive Yig away, and called down the aid of Tir¡, whose children men
   are, even as the snakes are Yig's children. It was bad that the squaw
   of Davis killed the children of Yig. Let Davis say the charms many
   times when the corn harvest comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god.

   By the time the corn harvest did come, Walker had succeeded in getting
   his wife into a deplorably jumpy state. His prayers and borrowed
   incantations came to be a nuisance; and when the autumn rites of the
   Indians began, there was always a distant wind-borne pounding of
   tom-toms to lend an added background of the sinister. It was maddening
   to have the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains.
   Why would it never stop? Day and night, week on week, it was always
   going in exhaustless relays, as persistently as the red dusty winds
   that carried it. Audrey loathed it more than her husband did, for he
   saw in it a compensating element of protection. It was with this sense
   of a mighty, intangible bulwark against evil that he got in his corn
   crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winter.

   The autumn was abnormally warm, and except for their primitive cookery
   the Davises found scant use for the stone fireplace Walker had built
   with such care. Something in the unnaturalness of the hot dust-clouds
   preyed on the nerves of all the settlers, but most of all on Audrey's
   and Walker's. The notions of a hovering snake-curse and the weird,
   endless rhythm of the distant Indian drums formed a bad combination
   which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly
   unendurable.

   Notwithstanding this strain, several festive gatherings were held at
   one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped; keeping
   naively alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvest-home
   which are as old as human agriculture itself. Lafayette Smith, who came
   from southern Missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of
   Walker's, was a very passable fiddler; and his tunes did much to make
   the celebrants forget the monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms.
   Then Hallowe'en drew near, and the settlers planned another
   frolic--this time, had they but known it, of a lineage older than even
   agriculture; the dread Witch-Sabbath of the primal pre-Aryans, kept
   alive through ages in the midnight blackness of secret woods, and still
   hinting at vague terrors under its latter-day mask of comedy and
   lightness. Hallowe'en was to fall on a Thursday, and the neighbours
   agreed to gather for their first revel at the Davis cabin.

   It was on that thirty-first of October that the warm spell broke. The
   morning was grey and leaden, and by noon the incessant winds had
   changed from searingness to rawness. People shivered all the more
   because they were not prepared for the chill, and Walker Davis' old dog
   Wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth. But
   the distant drums still thumped on, nor were the white citizenry less
   inclined to pursue their chosen rites. As early as four in the
   afternoon the wagons began to arrive at Walker's cabin; and in the
   evening, after a memorable barbecue, Lafayette Smith's fiddle inspired
   a very fair-sized company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in
   the one good-sized but crowded room. The younger folk indulged in the
   amiable inanities proper to the season, and now and then old Wolf would
   howl with doleful and spine-tickling ominousness at some especially
   spectral strain from Lafayette's squeaky violin--a device he had never
   heard before. Mostly, though, this battered veteran slept through the
   merriment; for he was past the age of active interests and lived
   largely in his dreams. Tom and Jennie Rigby had brought their collie
   Zeke along, but the canines did not fraternise. Zeke seemed strangely
   uneasy over something, and nosed around curiously all the evening.

   Audrey and Walker made a fine couple on the floor, and Grandma Compton
   still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night. Their
   worries seemed forgotten for the nonce, and Walker was shaved and
   trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness. By ten o'clock all
   hands were healthily tired, and the guests began to depart family by
   family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time
   everybody had had. Tom and Jennie thought Zeke's eerie howls as he
   followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go home;
   though Audrey said it must be the far-away tom-toms which annoyed him,
   for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment
   within.

   The night was bitterly cold, and for the first time Walker put a great
   log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering
   till morning. Old Wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed
   into his customary coma. Audrey and Walker, too tired to think of
   charms or curses, tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep
   before the cheap alarm-clock on the mantel had ticked out three
   minutes. And from far away, the rhythmic pounding of those hellish
   tom-toms still pulsed on the chill night-wind.

   Dr. McNeill paused here and removed his glasses, as if a blurring of
   the objective world might make the reminiscent vision clearer.

   "You'll soon appreciate," he said, "that I had a great deal of
   difficulty in piecing out all that happened after the guests left.
   There were times, though--at first--when I was able to make a try at
   it." After a moment of silence he went on with the tale.

   Audrey had terrible dreams of Yig, who appeared to her in the guise of
   Satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen. It was, indeed,
   from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake
   to find Walker already conscious and sitting up in bed. He seemed to be
   listening intently to something, and silenced her with a whisper when
   she began to ask what had roused him.

   "Hark, Aud!" he breathed. "Don't ye hear somethin' a-singin' and
   buzzin' and rustlin'? D'ye reckon it's the fall crickets?"

   Certainly, there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound
   as he had described. Audrey tried to analyse it, and was impressed with
   some element at once horrible and familiar, which hovered just outside
   the rim of her memory. And beyond it all, waking a hideous thought, the
   monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms came incessantly across the
   black plains on which a cloudy half-moon had set.

   "Walker--s'pose it's--the--the--curse o' Yig?"

   She could feel him tremble.

   "No, gal, I don't reckon he comes that away. He's shapen like a man,
   except ye look at him clost. That's what Chief Grey Eagle says. This
   here's some varmints come in outen the cold--not crickets, I calc'late,
   but summat like 'em. I'd orter git up and stomp 'em out afore they make
   much headway or git at the cupboard."

   He rose, felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach, and rattled
   the tin match-box nailed to the wall beside it. Audrey sat up in bed
   and watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the
   lantern. Then, as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room,
   the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek.
   For the flat, rocky floor, revealed in the new-born illumination, was
   one seething, brown-speckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes, slithering
   toward the fire, and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace
   the fright-blasted lantern-bearer.

   It was only for an instant that Audrey saw the things. The reptiles
   were of every size, of uncountable numbers, and apparently of several
   varieties; and even as she looked, two or three of them reared their
   heads as if to strike at Walker. She did not faint--it was Walker's
   crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into
   blackness. He had not screamed a second time--fright had paralysed him,
   and he fell as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortal's bow. To
   Audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically, mingling
   with the nightmare from which she had started.

   Voluntary motion of any sort was impossible, for will and the sense of
   reality had left her. She fell back inertly on her pillow, hoping that
   she would wake soon. No actual sense of what had happened penetrated
   her mind for some time. Then, little by little, the suspicion that she
   was really awake began to dawn on her; and she was convulsed with a
   mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out
   despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mute.

   Walker was gone, and she had not been able to help him. He had died of
   snakes, just as the old witch-woman had predicted when he was a little
   boy. Poor Wolf had not been able to help, either--probably he had not
   even awaked from his senile stupor. And now the crawling things must be
   coming for her, writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark,
   perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing up
   over the coarse woollen blankets. Unconsciously she crept under the
   clothes and trembled.

   It must be the curse of Yig. He had sent his monstrous children on
   All-Hallows' Night, and they had taken Walker first. Why was
   that--wasn't he innocent enough? Why not come straight for her--hadn't
   she killed those little rattlers alone? Then she thought of the curse's
   form as told by the Indians. She wouldn't be killed--just turned to a
   spotted snake. Ugh! So she would be like those things she had glimpsed
   on the floor--those things which Yig had sent to get her and enroll her
   among their number! She tried to mumble a charm that Walker had taught
   her, but found she could not utter a single sound.

   The noisy ticking of the alarm-clock sounded above the maddening beat
   of the distant tom-toms. The snakes were taking a long time--did they
   mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves? Every now and then she
   thought she felt a steady, insidious pressure on the bedclothes, but
   each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her
   overwrought nerves. The clock ticked on in the dark, and a change came
   slowly over her thoughts.

   Those snakes couldn't have taken so long! They couldn't be Yig's
   messengers after all, but just natural rattlers that were nested below
   the rock and had been drawn there by the fire. They weren't coming for
   her, perhaps--perhaps they had sated themselves on poor Walker. Where
   were they now? Gone? Coiled by the fire? Still crawling over the prone
   corpse of their victim? The clock ticked, and the distant drums
   throbbed on.

   At the thought of her husband's body lying there in the pitch blackness
   a thrill of purely physical horror passed over Audrey. That story of
   Sally Compton's about the man back in Scott County! He, too, had been
   bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes, and what had happened to him?
   The poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse, and in
   the end the bloated thing had burst horribly--burst horribly with a
   detestable popping noise. Was that what was happening to Walker down
   there on the rock floor? Instinctively she felt she had begun to listen
   for something too terrible even to name to herself.

   The clock ticked on, keeping a kind of mocking, sardonic time with the
   far-off drumming that the night-wind brought. She wished it were a
   striking clock, so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil
   must last. She cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her from
   fainting, and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring, after
   all. Probably neighbours would pass--no doubt somebody would
   call--would they find her still sane? Was she still sane now?

   Morbidly listening, Audrey all at once became aware of something which
   she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could
   believe it; and which, once verified, she did not know whether to
   welcome or dread. The distant beating of the Indian tom-toms had
   ceased. They had always maddened her--but had not Walker regarded them
   as a bulwark against nameless evil from outside the universe? What were
   some of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking
   with Grey Eagle and the Wichita medicine-men?

   She did not relish this new and sudden silence, after all! There was
   something sinister about it. The loud-ticking clock seemed abnormal in
   its new loneliness. Capable at last of conscious motion, she shook the
   covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window. It
   must have cleared after the moon set, for she saw the square aperture
   distinctly against the background of stars.

   Then without warning came that shocking, unutterable sound--ugh!--that
   dull, putrid pop of cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark.
   God!--Sally's story--that obscene stench, and this gnawing, clawing
   silence! It was too much. The bonds of muteness snapped, and the black
   night waxed reverberant with Audrey's screams of stark, unbridled
   frenzy.

   Consciousness did not pass away with the shock. How merciful if only it
   had! Amidst the echoes of her shrieking Audrey still saw the
   star-sprinkled square of window ahead, and heard the doom-boding
   ticking of that frightful clock. Did she hear another sound? Was that
   square window still a perfect square? She was in no condition to weigh
   the evidence of her senses or distinguish between fact and
   hallucination.

   No--that window was not a perfect square. Something had encroached on
   the lower edge. Nor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the
   room. There was, beyond dispute, a heavy breathing neither her own nor
   poor Wolf's. Wolf slept very silently, and his wakeful wheezing was
   unmistakable. Then Audrey saw against the stars the black, daemoniac
   silhouette of something anthropoid--the undulant bulk of a gigantic
   head and shoulders fumbling slowly toward her.

   "Y'aaaah! Y'aaaah! Go away! Go away! Go away, snake-devil! Go 'way,
   Yig! I didn't mean to kill 'em--I was feared he'd be scairt of 'em.
   Don't, Yig, don't! I didn't go for to hurt yore chillen--don't come
   nigh me--don't change me into no spotted snake!"

   But the half-formless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the
   bed, very silently.

   Everything snapped at once inside Audrey's head, and in a second she
   had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman. She knew where
   the axe was--hung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern. It
   was within easy reach, and she could find it in the dark. Before she
   was conscious of anything further it was in her hands, and she was
   creeping toward the foot of the bed--toward the monstrous head and
   shoulders that every moment groped their way nearer. Had there been any
   light, the look on her face would not have been pleasant to see.

   "Take that, you! And that, and that, and that!"

   She was laughing shrilly now, and her cackles mounted higher as she saw
   that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic
   pallor of coming dawn.

   Dr. McNeill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his
   glasses again. I waited for him to resume, and as he kept silent I
   spoke softly.

   "She lived? She was found? Was it ever explained?"

   The doctor cleared his throat.

   "Yes--she lived, in a way. And it was explained. I told you there was
   no bewitchment--only cruel, pitiful, material horror."

   It was Sally Compton who had made the discovery. She had ridden over to
   the Davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with Audrey,
   and had seen no smoke from the chimney. That was queer. It had turned
   very warm again, yet Audrey was usually cooking something at that hour.
   The mules were making hungry-sounding noises in the barn, and there was
   no sign of old Wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the door.

   Altogether, Sally did not like the look of the place, so was very timid
   and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked. She got no answer but
   waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs. The lock,
   it appeared, was unfastened; and she slowly pushed her way in. Then,
   perceiving what was there, she reeled back, gasped, and clung to the
   jamb to preserve her balance.

   A terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door, but that was
   not what had stunned her. It was what she had seen. For within that
   shadowy cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects
   remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholder.

   Near the burned-out fireplace was the great dog--purple decay on the
   skin left bare by mange and old age, and the whole carcass burst by the
   puffing effect of rattlesnake poison. It must have been bitten by a
   veritable legion of the reptiles.

   To the right of the door was the axe-hacked remnant of what had been a
   man--clad in a nightshirt, and with the shattered bulk of a lantern
   clenched in one hand. He was totally free from any sign of snake-bite.
   Near him lay the ensanguined axe, carelessly discarded.

   And wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome, vacant-eyed thing that
   had been a woman, but was now only a mute mad caricature. All that this
   thing could do was to hiss, and hiss, and hiss.

   Both the doctor and I were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by
   this time. He poured something from a flask on his desk, took a nip,
   and handed another glass to me. I could only suggest tremulously and
   stupidly:

   "So Walker had only fainted that first time--the screams roused him,
   and the axe did the rest?"

   "Yes." Dr. McNeill's voice was low. "But he met his death from snakes
   just the same. It was his fear working in two ways--it made him faint,
   and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to
   strike out when she thought she saw the snake-devil."

   I thought for a moment.

   "And Audrey--wasn't it queer how the curse of Yig seemed to work itself
   out on her? I suppose the impression of hissing snakes had been fairly
   ground into her."

   "Yes. There were lucid spells at first, but they got to be fewer and
   fewer. Her hair came white at the roots as it grew, and later began to
   fall out. The skin grew blotchy, and when she died--"

   I interrupted with a start.

   "Died? Then what was that--that thing downstairs?"

   McNeill spoke gravely.

   "That is what was born to her three-quarters of a year afterward. There
   were three more of them--two were even worse--but this is the only one
   that lived."

   The Descendant
   by H.P. Lovecraft
   The Descendant is a story fragment by American horror fiction writer H.
   P. Lovecraft, believed to have been written in 1927. It was first
   published in the journal Leaves in 1938, after Lovecraft's death. --

   8395The DescendantH.P. Lovecraft

   Writing on what my doctor tells me is my deathbed, my most hideous fear
   is that the man is wrong. I suppose I shall seem to be buried next
   week, but...
         In London there is a man who screams when the church bells ring.
   He lives all alone with his streaked cat in Gray's Inn, and people call
   him harmlessly mad. His room is filled with books of the tamest and
   most puerile kind, and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in
   their feeble pages. All he seeks from life is not to think. For some
   reason thought is very horrible to him, and anything which stirs the
   imagination he flees as a plague. He is very thin and grey and
   wrinkled, but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he
   looks. Fear has its grisly claws upon him, and a sound will make him
   start with staring eyes and sweat-beaded forehead. Friends and
   companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no questions. Those who
   once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him
   now. He dropped them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether he
   left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway. It is
   a decade now since he moved into Gray's Inn, and of where he had been
   he would say nothing till the night young Williams bought the
   Necronomicon.
         Williams was a dreamer, and only twenty-three, and when he moved
   into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic
   wind about the grey wizened man in the next room. He forced his
   friendship where old friends dared not force theirs, and marvelled at
   the fright that sat upon this gaunt, haggard watcher and listener. For
   that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt. He watched
   and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears, and strove
   every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay,
   insipid novels. And when the church bells rang he would stop his ears
   and scream, and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison
   till the last peal died reverberantly away.
         But try as Williams would, he could not make his neighbour speak
   of anything profound or hidden. The old man would not live up to his
   aspect and manner, but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle
   feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles; his voice every moment
   rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and
   incoherent falsetto. That his learning was deep and thorough, his most
   trivial remarks made abundantly clear; and Williams was not surprised
   to hear that he had been to Harrow and Oxford. Later it developed that
   he was none other than Lord Northam, of whose ancient hereditary castle
   on the Yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when Williams
   tried to talk of the castle, and of its reputed Roman origin, he
   refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it. He even
   tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts, hewn
   out of the solid crag that frowns on the North Sea, was brought up.
         So matters went till that night when Williams brought home the
   infamous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. He had known of
   the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year, when his dawning love of
   the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller
   in Chandos Street; and he had always wondered why men paled when they
   spoke of it. The old bookseller had told him that only five copies were
   known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers
   against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by
   custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful
   black-letter. But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible
   copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure. It was at a
   Jew's shop in the squalid precincts of Clare Market, where he had often
   bought strange things before, and he almost fancied the gnarled old
   Levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made.
   The bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently
   visible, and the price was so absurdly slight.
         The one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him
   into transports, and some of the diagrams set in the vague Latin text
   excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain. He
   felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin
   deciphering it, and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste
   that the old Jew chuckled disturbingly behind him. But when at last it
   was safe in his room he found the combination of black-letter and
   debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist, and reluctantly
   called on his strange, frightened friend for help with the twisted,
   mediaeval Latin. Lord Northam was simpering inanities to his streaked
   cat, and started violently when the young man entered. Then he saw the
   volume and shuddered wildly, and fainted altogether when Williams
   uttered the title. It was when he regained his senses that he told his
   story; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers, lest
   his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide
   scattering to its ashes.
         There must, Lord Northam whispered, have been something wrong at
   the start; but it would never have come to a head if he had not
   explored too far. He was the nineteenth Baron of a line whose beginings
   went uncomfortably far back into the past--unbelievably far, if vague
   tradition could be heeded, for there were family tales of a descent
   from pre-Saxon times, when a certain Lunaeus Gabinius Capito, military
   tribune in the Third Augustan Legion then stationed at Lindum in Roman
   Britain, had been summarily expelled from his command for participation
   in certain rites unconnected with any known religion. Gabinius had, the
   rumour ran, come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met
   together and made the Elder Sign in the dark; strange folk whom the
   Britons knew not save in fear, and who were the last to survive from a
   great land in the west that had sunk, leaving only the islands with the
   roths and circles and shrines of which Stonehenge was the greatest.
   There was no certainty, of course, in the legend that Gabinius had
   built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a
   line which Pict and Saxon, Dane and Norman were powerless to
   obliterate; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the
   bold companion and lieutenant of the Black Prince whom Edward Third
   created Baron of Northam. These things were not certain, yet they were
   often told; and in truth the stonework of Northam Keep did look
   alarmingly like the masonry of Hadrian's Wall. As a child Lord Northam
   had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle,
   and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory
   for half-amorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no
   part of his waking experience. He became a dreamer who found life tame
   and unsatisfying; a searcher for strange realms and relationships once
   familiar, yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth.
         Filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in
   a fabric vast and ominous, and that unknown demesnes press on and
   permeate the sphere of the known at every point, Northam in youth and
   young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult
   mystery. Nowhere, however, could he find ease and content; and as he
   grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more
   maddening to him. During the `nineties he dabbled in Satanism, and at
   all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to
   promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying
   laws of Nature. Books like Ignatius Donnelly's commerical account of
   Atlantis he absorbed with zest, and a dozen obscure precursors of
   Charles Fort enthralled him with their vagaries. He would travel
   leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder, and
   once went into the desert of Araby to seek a Nameless City of faint
   report, which no man has ever beheld. There rose within him the
   tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed, which if one
   found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled
   so dimly at the back of his memory. It might be in the visible world,
   yet it might be only in his mind and soul. Perhaps he held within his
   own half-explored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to
   elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to
   the stars, and to the infinities and eternities beyond them.

The Despised Pastoral

   The Despised Pastoral
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Published July 1918
   9662The Despised PastoralH. P. Lovecraft

   Among the many and complex tendencies observable in modern poetry, or
   what answers for poetry in this age, is a decided but unjust scorn of
   the honest old pastoral, immortalised by Theocritus and Virgil, and
   revived in our own literature by Spencer.

   Nor is this unfavorable attitude confined alone to the formal eclogue
   whose classical elements are so well described and exemplified by Mr.
   Pope. Whenever a versifier adorns his song with the pleasing and
   innocent imagery of this type of composition, or borrows its mild and
   sweet atmosphere, he is forthwith condemned as an irresponsible pedant
   and fossil by every little-wit critic in Grub-street.

   Modern bards, in their endeavour to display with seriousness and minute
   verisimilitude the inward operations of the human mind and emotions,
   have come to look down upon the simple description of ideal beauty, or
   the straightforward presentation of pleasing images for no other
   purpose than to delight the fancy. Such themes they deem trivial and
   artificial, and altogether unworthy of an art whose design they take to
   be the analysis and reproduction of Nature in all her moods and
   aspects.

   But in this belief, the writer cannot but hold that our contemporaries
   are misjudging the true province and functions of poesy. It was no
   starched classicist, but the exceedingly unconventional Edgar Allen
   Poe, who roundly denounced the melancholy metaphysicians and maintained
   that true poetry has for its first object "pleasure, not truth", and
   "indefinite pleasure instead of definite pleasure," intimating that its
   concern for the dull or ugly aspects of life is slight ideed. That the
   American bard and critic was fundamentally just in his deductions,
   seems well proved by a comparative survey of those poems of all ages
   which have lived, and those which have fallen into deserved obscurity.

   The English pastoral, based upon the best models of antiquity, depicts
   engaging scenes of Arcadian simplicity, which not only transport the
   imagination through their intrinsic beauty, but recall to the scholarly
   mind the choicest remembrances of classical Greece and Rome. Though the
   combination of rural pursuits with polished sentiments and diction is
   patently artificial, the beauty is not a whit less; nor do the
   conventional names, phrases, and images detract in the least from the
   quaint agreeableness of the whole. The magic of this sort of verse is
   to any unprejudiced mind irresistible, and capable of evoking a more
   deliciously placid and refreshing train of pictures in the imagination
   than may be obtained from any more realistic species of composition.
   Every untainted fancy begets ideal visions of which the pastoral forms
   a legitimate and artistically necessary reflection.

   It is not impossible that the intellectual upheaval attendant upon the
   present conflict will bring about a general simplification and
   rectification of taste, and an appreciation of the value of pure
   imaginary beauty in a world so full of actual misery, which may combine
   to restore the despised pastoral to its proper station.

   The Diary of Alonzo Typer
   by H. P. Lovecraft and William Lumley

   Published February 1938 in Weird Tales, 31, No. 2, 152-66.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Alonzo Hasbrouch Typer of Kingston, New York, was last
   seen and recognized on April 17, 1908, around noon, at the Hotel
   Richmond in Batavia. He was the only survivor of an ancient Ulster
   Country family, and was fifty-three years old at the time of his
   disappearance.

   Mr. Typer was educated privately and at Columbia and Heidelberg
   universities. All his life was spent as a student, the field of his
   researches including many obscure and generally feared borderlands of
   human knowledge. His papers on vampirism, ghouls and poltergeist
   phenomena were privately printed after rejection by many publishers. He
   resigned from the Society for Psychical Research in 1900 after a series
   of peculiarly bitter controversies.

   At various times Mr. Typer traveled extensively, sometimes dropping out
   of site for long periods. He is known to have visited obscure spots in
   Nepal, India, Tibet, and Indo-China, and passed most of the year 1899
   on mysterious Easter Island. The extensive search for Mr. Typer after
   his disappearance yielded no results, and his estate was divided among
   distant cousins in New York City.

   The diary herewith presented was allegedly found in the ruins of a
   large country house near Attica, N.Y., which had borne a curiously
   sinister reputation for generations before its collapse. The edifice
   was very old, antedating the general white settlement of the region,
   and had formed the home of a strange and secretive family named van der
   Heyl, which had migrated from Albany in 1746 under a curious cloud of
   witchcraft suspicion. The structure probably dated from about 1760.

   Of the history of the van der Heyls very little is known. They remained
   entirely aloof from their normal neighbors, employed negro servants
   brought directly from Africa and speaking little English, and educated
   their children privately and at European colleges. Those of them who
   went out into the world were soon lost to sight, though not before
   gaining evil repute for association with Black Mass groups and cults of
   even darker significance.

   Around the dreaded house a straggling village arose, populated by
   Indians and later by renegades from the surrounding contry, which bore
   the dubious name of Chorazin. Of the singular hereditary strains which
   afterward appeared in the mixed Chorazin villagers, several monographs
   have been written by ethnologists. Just behind the village, and in
   sight of the van der Heyl house, is a steep hill crowned with a
   peculiar ring of ancient standing stones which the Iroquois always
   regarded with fear and loathing. The origin and nature of the stones,
   whose date, according to archeological and climatalogical evidence,
   must be fabulously early, is a problem still unsolved.

   From about 1795 onward, the legends of the incoming pioneers and later
   population have much to say about strange cries and chants proceeding
   at certain seaons from Chorazin and from the great house and hill of
   standing stones; though there is reason to suppose that the noises
   ceased about 1872, when the entire van der Heyl household - servants
   and all - suddenly and simultaneously disappeared.

   Thenceforward the house was deserted; for other disastrous events -
   including three unexplained deaths, five disappearances, and four cases
   of sudden insanity - occurred when later owners and interested visitors
   attempted to stay in it. The house, village, and extensive rural areas
   on all sides reverted to the state and were auctioned off in the
   absence of discoverable van der Heyl heirs. Since about 1890 the owners
   (successively the late Charles A. Shields and his son Oscar S. Shields,
   of Buffalo) have left the entire property in a state of absolute
   neglect, and have warned all inquirers not to visit the region.

   Of those known to have approached the house during the last forty
   years, most were occult students, police officers, newspaper men, and
   odd characters from abroad. Among the latter was a mysterious Eurasian,
   probably from Chochin-China, whose later appearance with blank mind and
   bizarre mutilations excited wide press notice in 1903.

   Mr. Typer's diary - a book about 6 x 3 1/2 inches in size, with tough
   paper and an oddly durable binding of thin sheet metal - was discovered
   in the possession of one of the decadent Chorazin villagers on November
   16, 1935, by a state policeman sent to investigate the rumored collapse
   of the deserted van der Heyl mansion. The house had indeed fallen,
   obviously from sheer age and decrepitude, in the severe gale of
   November 12. Disintergration was peculiarly complete, and no thorough
   search of the ruins could be made for several weeks. John Eagle, the
   swarthy, simian-faced, Indian-like villager who had the diary, said
   that he found the book quite near the surface of the debris, in what
   must have been an upper front room.

   Very little of the contents of the house could be identified, though an
   enormous and astonishingly solid brick vault in the cellar (whose
   ancient iron door had to be blasted open because of the strangely
   figured and perversely tenacious lock) remained intact and presented
   several puzzling features. For one thing, the walls were covered with
   still undeciphered hieroglyphs roughly incised in the brickwork.
   Another peculiarity was a huge circular aperture in the rear of the
   vault, blocked by a cave-in evidently caused by the collapse of the
   house.

   But strangest of all was the apparently recent deposit of some fetid,
   slimy, pitch-black substance on the flagstoned floor, extending in a
   yardbroad, irregular line with one end at the blocked circular
   aperture. Those who first opened the vault declared that the place
   smelled like the snake-house at a zoo.

   The diary, which was apparently designed solely to cover an
   investigation of the dreaded van der Heyl house, by the vanished Mr.
   Typer, has been proved by handwriting experts to be genuine. The script
   shows signs of increasing nervous strain as it progresses toward the
   end, in places becoming almost illegible. Chorazin villagers - whose
   stupidity and taciturnity baffle all students of the region and its
   secrets - admit no recollection of Mr. Typer as distinguished from
   other rash visitors to the dreaded house.

   The text of the diary is here given verbatim and without comment. How
   to interpret it, and what, other than the writer's madness, to infer
   from it, the reader must decide for himself. Only the future can tell
   what its value may be in solving a generation-old mystery. It may be
   remarked that genealogists confirm Mr. Typer's belated memory in the
   matter of Adriaen Sleght.

   THE DIARY

   Arrived here about 6 P.M. Had to walk all the way from Attica in the
   teeth of an oncoming storm, for no one would rent me a horse or rig,
   and I can't run an automobile. This place is even worse than I had
   expected, and I dread what is coming, even though I long at the same
   time to learn the secret. All too soon will come the night - the old
   Walpurgis sabbat horror - and after that time in Wales I know what to
   look for. Whatever comes, I shall not flinch. Prodded by some
   unfathomable urge, I have given my whole life to the quest of unholy
   mysteries. I came here for nothing else, and will not quarrel with
   fate.

   It was very dark when I got here, though the sun had by no means set.
   The stormclouds were the densest I had ever seen, and I could not have
   found my way but for the lightning-flashes. The village is a hateful
   little back-water, and its few inhabitants no better than idiots. One
   of them saluted me in a queer way, as if he knew me. I could see very
   little of the landscape - just a small, swamp valley of strange brown
   weedstalks and dead fungi surrounded by scraggly, evilly twisted trees
   with bare boughs. But behind the village is a dismal-looking hill on
   whose summit is a circle of great stones with another stone at the
   center. That, without question, is the vile primordial thing V - - -
   told me about the N - - - estbat.

   The great house lies in the midst of a park all overgrown with
   curious-looking briars. I could scarcely break through, and when I did
   the vast age and decrepitude of the building almost stopped me from
   entering. The place looked filthy and diseased, and I wondered how so
   leprous a building could hang together. It is wooden; and though its
   original lines are hidden by a bewildering tangle of wings added at
   various dates, I think it was first built in the square colonial
   fashion of New England. Probably that was easier to build than a Dutch
   stone house - and then, too, I recall that Dirck van der Heyl's wife
   was from Salem, a daughter of the unmentionable Abaddon Corey. There
   was a small pillared porch, and I got under it just as the storm burst.
   It was a fiendish tempest - black as midnight, with rain in sheets,
   thunder and lightning like the day of general dissolution, and a wind
   that actually clawed at me.

   The door was unlocked, so I took out my electric torch and went inside.
   Dust was inches thick on floor and furniture, and the place smelled
   like a mold-caked tomb. There was a hall reaching all the way through,
   and a curving staircase on the right.

   I plowed my way upstairs and selected this front room to camp out in.
   The whole place seems fully furnished, though most of the furniture is
   breaking down. This is written at 8 o'clock, after a cold meal from my
   traveling-case. After this the village people will bring me supplies,
   though they won't agree to come any closer than the ruins of the park
   gate until (as they say) later. I wish I could get rid of an unpleasant
   feeling of familiarity with this place.

   Later

   I am conscious of several presences in this house. One in particular is
   decidedly hostile toward me - a malevolent will which is seeking to
   break down my own and overcome me. I must not countenance this for an
   instant, but must use all my forces to resist it. It is appallingly
   evil, and definitely nonhuman. I think it must be allied to powers
   outside Earth - powers in the spaces behind time and beyond the
   universe. It towers like a colossus, bearing out what is said in the
   Aklo writings. There is such a feeling of vast size connected with it
   that I wonder these chambers can contain its bulk - and yet it has no
   visible bulk. Its age must be unutterably vast - shockingly,
   indescribably so.

   April 18

   Slept very little last night. At 3 A.M. a strange, creeping wind began
   to pervade the whole region, ever rising until the house rocked as if
   in a typhoon. As I went down the staircase to see the rattling front
   door the darkness took half-visible forms in my imagination. Just below
   the landing I was pushed violently from behind - by the wind, I
   suppose, though I could have sworn I saw the dissolving outlines of a
   gigantic black paw as I turned quickly about. I did not lose my
   footing, but safely finished the descent and shot the heavy bolt of the
   dangerously shaking door.

   I had not meant to explore the house before dawn; yet now, unable to
   sleep again, and fired with mixed terror and curiousity, I felt
   reluctant to postpone my search. With my powerful torch I plowed
   through the dust to the great south parlor, where I knew the portraits
   would be. There they were, just as V - - - had said, and as I seemed to
   know from some obscurer source as well. Some were so blackened and
   dustclouded that I could make little or nothing of them, but from those
   I could trace I recognized that they were indeed of the hateful line of
   the van der Heyls. Some of the paintings seemed to suggest faces I had
   known; but just what faces, I could not recall.

   The outlines of that frightful hybrid Joris - spawned in 1773 by
   Dirck's youngest daughter - were clearest of all, and I could trace the
   green eyes and the serpent look in his face. Every time I shut off the
   flashlight that face would seem to glow in the dark until I half
   fancied it shone with a faint, greenish light of its own. The more I
   looked, the more evil it seemed, and I turned away to avoid
   hallucinations of changing expression.

   But that to which I turned was even worse. The long, dour face, small,
   closely set eyes and swine-like features identified it at once, even
   though the artist had striven to make the snout look as human as
   possible. This was what V - - - had whispered about. As I stared in
   horror, I thought the eyes took on a reddish glow, and for a moment the
   background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scene -
   a lone, bleak moor beneath a dirty yellow sky, whereon grew a
   wretched-looking blackthorn bush. Fearing for my sanity, I rushed from
   that accursed gallery to the dust-cleared corner upstairs where I have
   my "camp."

   Later

   Decided to explore some more of the labyrinthine wings of the house by
   daylight. I cannot be lost, for my footprints are distinct in the
   ankle-deep dust, and I can trace other identifying marks when
   necessary. It is curious how easily I learn the intricate windings of
   the corridors. Followed a long, outflung northerly "ell" to its
   extremity, and came to a locked door, which I forced. Beyond was a very
   small room quite crowded with furniture, and with the panelling badly
   worm-eaten. On the outer wall I spied a black space behind the rotting
   woodwork, and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to
   unknown inky depths. It was a steeply inclined chute or tunnel without
   steps or handholds, and I wondered what its use could have been.

   Above the fireplace was a moldy painting, which I found on close
   inspection to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late
   Eighteenth Century. The face is of classic beauty, yet with the most
   fiendishly evil expression which I have ever known the human
   countenance to bear. Not merely callousness, greed, and cruelty, but
   some quality hideous beyond human comprehension seems to sit upon those
   finely carved features. And as I looked it seemed to me that the artist
   - or the slow processes of mold and decay - had imparted to that pallid
   complexion a sickly greenish cast, and the least suggestion of an
   almost imperceptibly scaly texture. Later I ascended to the attic,
   where I found several chests of strange books - many of utterly alien
   aspects in letters and in physical form alike. One contained variants
   of the Aklo formulae which I had never known to exist. I have not yet
   examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairs.

   April 19

   There are certainly unseen presences here, even though the dust bears
   no footprints but my own. Cut a path through the briars yeseterday to
   the park gate where my supplies are left, but this morning I found it
   closed. Very odd, since the bushes are barely stirring with spring sap.
   Agin I had that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the
   chambers can scarely contain it. This time I feel more than one of the
   presences is of such a size, and I know now that the third Aklo ritual
   - which I found in that book in the attic yesterday - would make such
   being solid and visible. Whether I shall dare to try this
   materialization remains to be seen. The perils are great.

   Last night I began to glimpse evanescent shadow-faces and forms in the
   dim corners of the halls and chambers - faces and forms so hideous and
   loathsome that I dare not describe them. They seemed allied in
   substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me down the stairs
   night before last, and must of course be phantoms of my disturbed
   imagination. What I am seeking would not be quite like these things. I
   have seen the paw again, sometimes alone and sometimes with its mate,
   but I have resolved to ignore all such phenomena.

   Early this afternoon I explored the cellar for the first time,
   descending by a ladder found in a store-room, since the wooden steps
   had rotted away. The whole place is a mass of nitrous encrustations,
   with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects have
   disintegrated. At the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to
   extend under the northerly "ell" where I found the little locked room,
   and at the end of this is a heavy brick wall with a locked iron door.
   Apparently belonging to a vault of some sort, this wall and door bear
   evidences of the Eighteenth Century workmanship and must be
   contemporary with the oldest additions to the house - clearly
   pre-Revolutionary. On the lock, which is obviously older than the rest
   of the ironwork, are engraved certain symbols which I cannot decipher.

   V - - - had not told me about this vault. It fills me with a greater
   disquiet than anything else I have seen, for every time I approach it I
   have an almost irresistible impulse to listen for something. Hitherto
   no untoward sounds have marked my stay in this malign place. As I left
   the cellar I wished devoutly that the steps were still there; for my
   progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow. I do not want to go
   down there again - and yet some evil genius urges me to try it at night
   if I would learn what is to be learned.

   April 20

   I have sounded the depths of horror - only to be made aware of still
   lower depths. Last night the temptation was too strong, and in the
   black small hours I descended once more into that nitrous, hellish
   cellar with my flashlight, tiptoeing among the amorphous heaps to that
   terrible brick wall and locked door. I made no sound, and refrained
   from whispering any of the incantations I knew, but I listened with mad
   intentness.

   At last I heard the sounds from beyond those barred plates of sheet
   iron, the menacing padding and muttering as of gigantic night-things
   within. Then, too, there was a damnable slithering, as of a vast
   serpent or sea-beast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor.
   Nearly paralyzed with firght, I glanced at the huge rusty lock, and at
   the alien, cryptic hieroglyphs graven upon it. They were signs I could
   not recognize, and something in their vaguely Mongoloid technique
   hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity. At times I fancied
   I could see them glowing with a greenish light.

   I turned to flee, but found that vision of the titan paws before me,
   the great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as I gazed.
   Out of the cellar's evil blackness they stretched, with shadowy hints
   of scaly wrists beyond them, and with a waxing, malignant will guiding
   their horrible gropings. Then I heard from behind me - within that
   abominable vault - a fresh burst of muffled reverberations which seemed
   to echo from far horizons like distant thunder. Impelled by this
   greater fear, I advanced toward the shadowy paws with my flashlight and
   saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam. Then up the
   ladder I raced, torch between my teeth, nor did I rest till I had
   regained my upstairs "camp."

   What is to be my ultimate end, I dare not imagine. I came as a seeker,
   but now I know that something is seeking me. I could not leave if I
   wished. This morning I tried to go to the gate for my supplies, but
   found the briars twisted tightly in my path. It was the same in every
   direction - behind and on all sides of the house. In places the brown,
   barbed vines had uncurled to astonishing heights, forming a steel-like
   hedge against my egress. The villagers are connected with all this.
   When I went indoors I found my supplies in the great front hall, though
   without any clue as to how they came there. I am sorry now that I swept
   the dust away. I shall scatter some more and see what prints are left.

   This afternoon I read some of the books in the great shadowy library at
   the rear of the ground floor, and formed certain suspicions which I
   cannot bear to mention. I had never seen the text of the Pnakotic
   Manuscripts or of the Eltdown Shards before, and would not have come
   here had I known what they contain. I believe it is too late now - for
   the awful Sabbat is only ten days away. It is for that night of horror
   that they are saving me.

   April 21

   I have been studying the portraits again. Some have names attached, and
   I noticed one - of an evil-faced woman, painted some two centuries ago
   - which puzzled me. It bore the name of Trintje van der Heyl Sleght,
   and I have a distinct impression that I once met the name of Sleght
   before, in some significant connection. It was not horrible then,
   though it becomes so now. I must rack my brain for the clue.

   The eyes of the pictures haunt me. Is it possible that some of them are
   emerging more distinctly from their shrouds of dust and decay and mold?
   The serpent-faced and swine-faced warlocks stare horribly at me from
   their blackened frames, and a score of other hybrid faces are beginning
   to peer out of shadowy backgrounds. There is a hideous look of family
   resemblance in them all, and that which is human is more horrible than
   that which is non-human. I wish they reminded me less of other faces -
   faces I have known in the past. They were an accursed line, and
   Cornelis of Leydon was the worst of them. It was he who broke down the
   barrier after his father had found that other key. I am sure that V - -
   - knows only a fragment of the horrible truth, so that I am indeed
   unprepared and defenseless. What of the line before old Class? What he
   did in 1591 could never have been done without generations of evil
   heritage, or some link with the outside. And what of the branches this
   monstrous line has sent forth? Are they scattered over the world, all
   awaiting their common heritage of horror? I must recall the place where
   I once so particularly noticed the name of Sleght.

   I wish I could be sure that those pictures stay always in their frames.
   For several hours now I have been seeing momentary presences like the
   earlier paws and shadow-faces and forms, but closely duplicating some
   of the ancient portraits. Somehow I can never glimpse a presence and
   the portrait it resembles at the same time - the light is always wrong
   for one or the other, or else the presence and the portrait are in
   different rooms.

   Perhaps, as I have hoped, the presences are mere figments of
   imagination, but I cannot be sure now. Some are female, and of the same
   helling beauty as the picture in the little locked room. Some are like
   no portrait I have seen, yet make me feel that their painted features
   lurk unrecognized beneath the mold and soot of canvases I cannot
   decipher. A few, I desperately fear, have approached materialization in
   solid or semi-solid form - and some have a dreaded and unexplained
   familiarity.

   There is one woman who in full loveliness excels all the rest. Her
   poisonous charms are like a honeyed flower growing on the brink of
   hell. When I look at her closely she vanishes, only to reappear later.
   Her face has a greenish cast, and now and then I fancy I can spy a
   suspicion of the squamous in its smooth texture. Who is she? Is she
   that being who dwelt in the little locked room a century and more ago?

   My supplies were again left in the front hall - that, clearly, is to be
   the custom. I had sprinkled dust about to catch footprints, but this
   morning the whole hall was swept clean by some unknown agency.

   April 22

   This has been a day of horrible discovery. I explored the cobwebbed
   attic again, and found a carved, crumbling chest - plainly from Holland
   - full of blasphemous books and papers far older than any hitherto
   encountered here. There was a Greek Necronomicon, a Norman-French Livre
   d'Eibon, and a first edition of old Ludvig Prinn's De Vermis Mysteriis.
   But the old bound manuscript was the worst. It was in low Latin, and
   full of the strange, crabbed handwriting of Claes van der Heyl, being
   evidently the diary or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580. When
   I unfastened the blackened silver clasp and opened the yellowed leaves
   a colored drawing fluttered out - the likeness of a monstrous creature
   resembling nothing so much as a squid, beaked and tentacled, with great
   yellow eyes, and with certain abominable approximations to the human
   form in its contours.

   I had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form. On
   the paws, feet, and head-tentacles were curious claws - reminding me of
   the colossal shadow-shapes which had groped so horribly in my path -
   while the entity as a whole sat upon a great throne-like pedastal
   inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely Chinese cast. About both
   writing and image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and
   pervasive that I could not think it the product of any one world or
   age. Rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the evil in
   unbounded space, throughout the eons past and to come - and those
   eldritch symbols be vile sentitent ikons endows with a morbid life of
   their own and ready to wrest themselves from the parchment for the
   reader's destruction. To the meaning of that monster and of those
   hieroglpyhs I had no clue, but I knew that both had been traced with a
   hellish precision and for no namable purpose. As I studdied the leering
   characters, their kinship to the symbols on that ominous lock in the
   cellar became more and more manifest. I left the picture in the attic,
   for never could sleep come to me with such a thing near by.

   All the afternoon and evening I read in the manuscript book of old
   Claes van der Heyl; and what I read will cloud and make horrible
   whatever period of life lies ahead of me. The genesis of the world, and
   of previous worlds, unfolded itself before my eyes. I learned of the
   city Shamballah, built by the Lemurians fifty million years ago, yet
   inviolate still behind its wall of psychic force in the eastern dester.
   I learned of the Book of Dzyan, whose first six chapters antedate the
   Earth, and which was old when the lords of Venus came through space in
   their ships to civilize our planet. And I saw recorded in writing for
   the first time that name which others had spoken to me in whispers, and
   which I had known in a closer and more horrible way - the shunned and
   dread name of Yian-Ho.

   In several places I was help up by passages requiring a key.
   Eventually, from various allusions, I gathered that old Claes had not
   dared to embody all his knowledge in one book, but had left certain
   points for another. Neither volume can be wholly intelligible without
   its fellow; hence I have resolved to find the second one if it lies
   anywhere within this accursed house. Though plainly a prisoner, I have
   not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown; and am determined to probe
   the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comes.

   April 23

   Searched all the morning for the second diary, and found it about noon
   in a desk in the little locked room. Like the first, it is in Claes van
   der Heyl's barbarous Latin, and it seems to consist of disjointed notes
   referring to various sections of the other. Glancing through the
   leaves, I spied at once the abhorred name of Yian-Ho - of Yian-Ho, that
   lost and hidden city wherein brood eon-old secrets, and of which dim
   memories older than the body lurk behind the minds of all men. It was
   repeated many times, and the text around it was strewn with
   crudely-drawn hieroglyphs plainly akin to those on the pedestal in that
   hellish drawing I had seen. Here, clearly, lay the key to that
   monstrous tentacled shape and its forbidden message. With this
   knowledge I ascended the creaking stairs to the attic of cobwebs and
   horror.

   When I tried to open the attic door it stuck as never before. Several
   times it resisted every effort to open it, and when at last it gave way
   I had a distinct feeling that some colossal unseen shape had suddenly
   released it - a shape that soared away on non-material but audibly
   beating wings. When I found the horrible drawing I felt that it was not
   precisely where I left it. Applying the key in the other book, I soon
   saw that the latter was no instant guide to the secret. It was only a
   clue - a clue to a secret too black to be left lightly guarded. It
   would take hours - perhaps days - to extract the awful message.

   Shall I live long enough to learn the secret? The shadowy black arms
   and paws haunt my vision more and more now, and seem even more titanic
   than at first. Nor am I ever long free from those vague, unhuman
   presences whose nebulous bulk seems too vast for the chambers to
   contain. And now and then the grotesque, evanescent faces and forms,
   and the mocking portrait-shapes, troop before me in bewildering
   confusion.

   Truly, there are terrible primal arcana of Earth which had better be
   left unknown and unevoked; dread secrets which have nothing to do with
   man, and which man may learn only in exchange for peace and sanity;
   cryptic truths which make the knower evermore an alien among his kind,
   and cause him to walk alone on Earth. Likewise there are dread
   survivals of things older and more potent than man; things that have
   blasphemously straggled down through the eons to ages never ment for
   them; monstrous entities that have lain sleeping endlessly in
   incredible crypts and remote caverns, outside the laws of reason and
   causation, and ready to be waked by such blasphemers as shall know
   their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwords.

   April 24

   Studied the picture and the key all day in the attic. At sunset I heard
   strange sounds, of a sort not encountered before and seeming to come
   from far away. Listening, I realized that they must flow from that
   queer abrupt hill with the circle of standing stones, which lies behind
   the village and some distance north of the house. I had heard that
   there was a path from the house leading up that hill to the primal
   cromlech, and had suspected that at certain seasons the van der Heyls
   had much occasion to use it; but the whole matter had hitherto lain
   latent in my consciousness. The present sounds consisted of a shrill
   piping intermingled with a peculiar and hideous sort of hissing or
   whistling, a bizarre, alien kind of music, like nothing which the
   annals of Earth describe. It was very faint, and soon faded, but the
   matter has set met thinking. It is toward the hill that the long,
   northerly "ell" with the secret chute, and the locked brick vault under
   it, extend. Can there be any connection which has so far eluded me?

   April 25

   I have made a peculiar and disturbing discovery about the nature of my
   imprisonment. Drawn toward the hill by a sinsiter fascination, I found
   the briars giving way before me, but in that direction only. There is a
   ruined gate, and beneath the bushes the traces of an old path no doubt
   exist. The briars extend part-way up and all around the hill, though
   the summit with the standing stones bears only a curious growth of moss
   and stunted grass. I climbed the hill and spent several hours there,
   noticing a strange wind which seems always to sweep around the
   forbidding monoliths and which sometimes seems to whisper in an oddly
   articulate though darkly cryptic fashion.

   These stones, both in color and texture, resemble nothing I have seen
   elsewhere. They are neither brown nor gray, but rather of a dirty
   yellow merging into an evil green and having a suggestion of
   chameleon-like variability. Their texture is queerly like that of a
   scaled serpent, and is inexplicably nauseous to the touch - being as
   cold and clammy as the skin of a toad or other reptile. Near the
   central menhir is a singular stone-rimmed hollow which I cannot
   explain, but which may possibly form the entrance to a long-choked well
   or tunnel. When I sought to descend the hill at points away from the
   house I found the briars intercepting me as before, though the path
   toward the house was easily retraceable.

   April 26

   Up on the hill again this evening, and found that windy whispering much
   more distinct. The almost angry humming came close to actual speech, of
   a vague, sibilant sort, and reminded me of the strange piping chant I
   had heard from a far. After sunset there came a curious flash of
   premature summer lightning on the northern horizon, followed almost at
   once by a queer detonation high in the fading sky. Something about this
   phenomenon disturbed me greatly, and I could not escape the impression
   that the noise ended in a kind of unhuman hissing speech which trailed
   off into guttural cosmic laughter. Is my mind tottering at last, or has
   my unwarranted curiousity evoked unheard-of horrors from the twilight
   spaces? The Sabbat is close at hand now. What will be the end?

   April 27

   At last my dreams are to be realized! Whether or not my life or spirit
   or body will be claimed, I shall enter the gateway! Progress in
   deciphering those crucial hieroglpyhs in the picture has been slow, but
   this afternoon I hit upon the final clue. By evening I knew their
   meaning - and that meaning can apply in only one way to the things I
   have encountered in this house.

   There is beneath this house - sepulchered I know not where - an Ancient
   One Who will show me the gateway I would enter, and give me the lost
   signs and words I shall need. How long It has lain buried here,
   forgotten save by those who reared the stone on the hill, and by those
   who later sought out this place and built this house, I cannot
   conjecture. It was in search of this Thing, beyond question, that
   Hendrik van der Heyl came to New-Netherland in 1638. Men of this Earth
   know It not, save in the secret whispers of the fear-shaken few who
   have found or inherited the key. No human eye has even yet glimpsed It
   - unless, perhaps, the vanished wizards of this house delved farther
   than has been guessed.

   With knowledge of the symbols came likewise a mastery of the Seven Lost
   Signs of Terror, and a tacit recognition of the hideous and unutterable
   Words of Fear. All that remains for me to accomplish is the Chant which
   will transfigure that Forgotten One Who is Guardian of the Ancient
   Gateway. I marvel much at the Chant. It is composed of strange and
   repellent gutturals and disturbing sibilants resembling no language I
   have ever encountered, even in the blackest chapters of the Livre
   d'Eibon. When I visited the hill at sunset I tried to read it aloud,
   but evoked in response only a vague, sinister rumbling on the far
   horizon, and a thin cloud of elemental dust that writhed and whirld
   like some evil living thing. Perhaps I do not pronounce the alien
   syllables correctly, or perhaps it is only on the Sabbat - that hellish
   Sabbat for which the Powers in this house are without question holding
   me - that the great Transfiguration can occur.

   Had an odd spell of fright this morning. I thought for a moment that I
   recalled where I had seen that baffling name of Sleght before, and the
   prospect of realization filled me with unutterable horror.

   April 28

   Today dark ominous clouds have hovered intermittently over the circle
   on this hill. I have noticed such clouds several times before, but
   their contours and arrangements now hold a fresh significance. They are
   snake-like and fantastic, and curiously like the evil shadow-shapes I
   have seen in the house. They float in a circle around the primal
   cromlech, revolving repeatedly as though endowed with a sinister life
   and purpose. I could swear that they give forth an angry murmering.
   After some fifteen minutes they sail slowly away, ever to the eastward,
   like the units of a straggling batallion. Are they indeed those dread
   Ones whom Solomon knew of old - those giant black beings whose number
   is legion and whose tread doth shake the earth?

   I have been rehearsing the Chant that will transfigure the Nameless
   Thing; yet strange fears assail me even when I utter the syllables
   under my breath. Piercing all evidence together, I have now discovered
   that the only way to It is throught the locked cellar vault. That vault
   was built with a hellish purpose, and must cover the hidden burrow
   leading to the Immemorial Lair. What guardians live endlessly within,
   flourishing from century to century on an unknown nourishment, only the
   mad may conjecture. The warlocks of this house, who called them out of
   inner Earth, have known them only too well, as the shocking portraits
   and memories of the place reveal.

   What troubles me most is the limited nature of the Chant. It evokes the
   Nameless One, yet provides no method for the control of That Which is
   evoked. There are, of course, the general signs and gestures, but
   whether they will prove effective toward such an One remains to be
   seen. Still, the rewards are great enough to justify any danger, and I
   could not retreat if I would, since an unknown force plainly urges me
   on.

   I have discovered one more obstacle. Since the locked cellar vault must
   be traversed, the key to that place must be found. The lock is far too
   strong for forcing. That the key is somewhere hereabouts cannot be
   doubted, but the time before the Sabbat is very short. I must search
   diligently and thoroughly. It will take courage to unlock that iron
   door, for what prisoned horrors may not lurk within?

   Later

   I have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two, but late this
   afternoon I again descended to those forbidding precincts.

   At first all was silent, but within five minutes the menacing padding
   and muttering began once more beyond the iron door. This time it was
   loud and more terrifying than on any previous occasion, and I likewise
   recognized the slithering that bespoke some monstrous sea-beast - now
   swifter and nervously intensified, as if the thing were striving to
   force its way through the portal where I stood.

   As the pacing grew louder, more restless, and more sinister, there
   began to pound through it those hellish and more unidentifiable
   reverberations which I had heard on my second visit to the cellar -
   those muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons
   like distant thunder. Now, however, their volume was magnified an
   hundredfold, and their timbre freighted with new and terrifying
   implications. I can compare the sound to nothing more aptly than the
   roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age, when primal
   horrors roamed the Earth, and Valusia's serpent-men laid the
   foundation-stones of evil magic. To such a roar - but swelled to
   deafening heights reached by no known organic throat - was this
   shocking sound akin. Dare I unlock the door and face the onslaught of
   what lies beyond?

   April 29

   The key to the vault is found. I came upon it this noon in the little
   locked room - buried beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk,
   as if some belated effort to conceal it had been made. It was wrapped
   in a crumbling newspaper dated October 31, 1872; but there was an inner
   wrapping of dried skin - evidently the hide of some unknown reptile -
   which bore a Low Latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of
   the notebooks I found. As I had thought, the lock and key were vastly
   older than the vault. Old Claes van der Heyl had them ready for
   something he or his descendants meant to do - and how much older than
   he they were I could not estimate. Deciphering the Latin message, I
   trembled in a fresh access of clutching terror and nameless awe.

   "The secrets of the monstrous primal Ones;" ran the crabbed text,
   "whose cryptic words relate the hidden things that were before man; the
   things no one of Earth should learn, lest peace be for ever forfeited;
   shall be me never suffer revelation. To Yian-Ho, that lost and
   forbidden city of countless eons whose place may not be told, I have
   been in the veritable flesh of this body, as none other among the
   living has been. Therein have I found, and thence have I borne away,
   that knowledge which I would glady lose, though I may not. I have
   learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged, and must call out of
   the Earth That Which should not be waked nor called. And what is sent
   to follow me will not sleep till I or those after me have found and
   done what is to be found and done.

   "That which I have awaked and borne away with me, I may not part with
   again. So it is written in the Book of Hidden Things. That which I have
   willed to be has twined its dreadful shape around me, and - if I live
   not to do its bidding - around those children born and unborn who shall
   come after me, until the bidding be done. Strange may be their
   joinings, and awful the aid they may summon till the end be reached.
   Into lands unknown and dim must the seeking go, and a house must be
   built for the outer guardians.

   "This is the key to that lock which was given me in the dreadful,
   eon-old and forbidden city of Yian-Ho; the lock which I or mine must
   place upon the vestibule of That Which is to be found. And may the
   Lords of Yaddith succor me - or him - who must set that lock in place
   or turn the key thereof."

   Such was the message - a message which, once I had read it, I seemed to
   have known before. Now, as I write these words, the key is before me. I
   gaze on it with mixed dread and longing, and cannot find words to
   describe its aspect. It is of the same unknown, subtly greenish frosted
   metal as the lock; a metal best compared to brass tarnished with
   verdigris. Its design is alien and fantastic, and the coffin-shaped end
   of the ponderous bulk leaves no doubt of the lock it was meant to fit.
   The handle roughly forms a strange, nonhuman image, whose exact
   outlines and identity cannot now be traced. Upon holding it for any
   length of time I seem to feel an alien, anomalous life in the cold
   metal - a quickening or pulsing too feeble for ordinary recognition.

   Below the eidolon is graven a faint, eon-worn legend in those
   blasphemous, Chinese-like hieroglyphs I have come to know so well. I
   can only make out the beginning - the words: "My vengeance lurks . . ."
   - before the text fades to insistinctness. There is some fatality in
   this timely finding of the key - for tomorrow night comes the hellish
   Sabbat. But strangely enough, amidst all this hideous expectancy, that
   question of the Sleght name bothers me more and more. Why should I
   dread to find it linked with the van der Heyls?

   Walpurgis-Eve - April 30

   The time has come. I waked last night to see the key glowing with a
   lurid greenish radiance - that same morbid green which I have seen in
   the eyes and skin of certain portraits here, on the shocking lock and
   key, on the monstrous menhirs of the hill, and in a thousand other
   recesses of my consciousness. There were strident whispers in the air -
   sibilant whisperings like those of the wind around that dreadful
   cromlech. Something spoke to me out of the frore [?] aether of space,
   and it said, "The hour falls." It is an omen, and I laugh at my own
   fears. Have I not the dread words and the Seven Lost Signs of Terror -
   the power coercive of any Dweller in the cosmos or in the unknown
   darkened spaces? I will no longer hesistate.

   The heavens are very dark, as if a terrific storm were coming on - a
   storm even greater than that of the night when I reached here, nearly a
   fortnight ago. From the village, less than a mile away, I hear a queer
   and unwonted babbling. It is as I thought - these poor degraded idiots
   are within the secret, and keep the awful Sabbat on the hill.

   Here in the house the shadows gather densely. In the darkness the sky
   before me almost glows with a greenish light of its own. I have no yet
   been to the cellar. It is better that I wait, lest the sound of that
   muttering and padding - those slitherings and muffled reverberations -
   unnerve me before I can unlock the fateful door.

   Of what I shall encounter, and what I must do, I have only the most
   general idea. Shall I find my task in the vault itself, or must I
   burrow deeper into the nighted heart of our planet? There are things I
   do not yet understand - or at least, prefer not to understand - despite
   a dreadful, increasing and inexplicable sense of bygone familiarity
   with this fearsome house. That chute, for instance, leading down from
   the little locked room. But I think I know why the wing with the vault
   extends toward the hill.

   6 P.M.

   Looking out the north windows, I can see a group of villagers on the
   hill. They seem unaware of the lowering sky, and are digging near the
   great central menhir. It occurs to me that they are working on that
   stone-rimmed hollow place which looks like a long-choked tunnel
   entrance. What is to come? How much of the olden Sabbat rites have
   these people retained? That key glows horribly - it is not imagination.
   Dare I use it as it must be used? Another matter has greatly disturbed
   me. Glancing nervously through a book in the library I came upon an
   ampler form of the name that has teased my memory so sorely: "Trintje,
   wife of Adriaen Sleght." The Adriaen leads me to the very brink of
   recollection.

   Midnight

   Horror is unleashed, but I must not weaken. The storm has broken with
   pandemoniac fury, and lightning has struck the hill three times, yet
   the hybrid, malformed villagers are gathering within the cromlech. I
   can see them in the almost constant flashes. The great standing stones
   loom up shockingly, and have a dull green luminosity that reveals them
   even when the lightning is not there. The peals of thunder are
   deafening, and every one seems to be horribly answered from some
   indeterminate direction. As I write, the creatures on the hill have
   begun to chant and howl and scream in a degraded, half-simian version
   of the ancient ritual. Rain pours down like a flood, yet they leap and
   emit sounds in a kind of diabolic ecstacy.

   "Iä Shub-Niggurath! The Goat With a Thousand Young!"

   But the worst thing is within the house. Even at this height, I have
   begun to hear sounds from the cellar. It is the padding and muttering
   and slithering and muffled reverberations within the vault. . . .

   Memories come and go. That name Adriaen Sleght pounds oddly at my
   consciousness. Dirck van der Heyl's son-in-law . . . his child old
   Dirck's granddaughter and Abaddon Corey's greatgranddaughter. . . .

   Later

   Merciful God! At last I know where I saw that name. I know, and am
   transfixed with horror. All is lost. . .

   The key has begun to fell warm as my left hand nervously clutches it.
   At times that vague quickening or pulsing is so distinct that I can
   almost feel the living metal move. It came from Yian-Ho for a terrible
   purpose, and to me - who all too late know the thing stream of van der
   Heyl blood that trickles down through the Sleghts into my own lineage -
   has descended the hideous task of fulfilling that purpose. . . .

   My courage and curiousity wane. I know the horror that lies beyond that
   iron door. What if Claes van der Heyl was my ancestor - need I expiate
   his nameless sin? I will not - I swear I will not! . . . (the writing
   here grows indistinct) . . . too late - cannot help self - black paws
   materialize - am dragged away toward the cellar. . . .

   and D. W. Rimel

   I awoke abruptly from a horrible dream and stared wildly about. Then,
   seeing the high, arched ceiling and the narrow stained windows of my
   friend's room, a flood of uneasy revelation coursed over me; and I knew
   that all of Andrews' hopes had been realized. I lay supine in a large
   bed, the posts of which reared upward in dizzy perspective; while on
   vast shelves about the chamber were the familiar books and antiques I
   was accustomed to seeing in that secluded corner of the crumbling and
   ancient mansion which had formed our joint home for many years. On a
   table by the wall stood a huge candelabrum of early workmanship and
   design, and the usual light window-curtains had been replaced by
   hangings of somber black, which took on a faint, ghostly luster in the
   dying light.

   I recalled forcibly the events preceding my confinement and seclusion
   in this veritable medieval fortress. They were not pleasant, and I
   shuddered anew when I remembered the couch that had held me before my
   tenancy of the present one - the couch that everyone supposed would be
   my last. Memory burned afresh regarding those hideous circumstances
   which had compelled me to choose between a true death and a
   hypothetical one - with a later re-animation by therapeutic methods
   known only to my comrade, Marshall Andrews. The whole thing had begun
   when I returned from the Orient a year before and discovered, to my
   utter horror, that I had contracted leprosy while abroad. I had known
   that I was taking grave chances in caring for my stricken brother in
   the Philippines, but no hint of my own affliction appeared until I
   returned to my native land. Andrews himself had made the discovery, and
   kept it from me as long as possible; but our close acquaintance soon
   disclosed the awful truth.

   At once I was quartered in our ancient abode atop the crags overlooking
   crumbling Hampden, from whose musty halls and quaint, arched doorways I
   was never permitted to go forth. It was a terrible existence, with the
   yellow shadow hanging constantly over me; yet my friend never faltered
   in his faith, taking care not to contract the dread scourge, but
   meanwhile making life as pleasant and comfortable as possible. His
   widespread though somewhat sinister fame as a surgeon prevented any
   authority from discovering my plight and shipping me away.

   It was after nearly a year of this seclusion - late in August - that
   Andrews decided on a trip to the West Indies - to study "native"
   medical methods, he said. I was left in care of venerable Simes, the
   household factotum. So far no outward signs of the disease had
   developed, and I enjoyed a tolerable though almost completely private
   existence during my colleague's absence. It was during this time that I
   read many of the tomes Andrews had acquired in the course of his twenty
   years as a surgeon, and learned why his reputation, though locally of
   the highest, was just a bit shady. For the volumes included any number
   of fanciful subjects hardly related to modern medical knowledge:
   treatises and unauthoritative articles on monstrous experiments in
   surgery; accounts of the bizarre effects of glandular transplantation
   and rejuvenation in animals and men alike; brochures on attempted brain
   transference, and a host of other fanatical speculations not
   countenanced by orthodox physicians. It appeared, too, that Andrews was
   an authority on obscure medicaments; some of the few books I waded
   through revealing that he had spent much time in chemistry and in the
   search for new drugs which might be used as aids in surgery. Looking
   back at those studies now, I find them hellishly suggestive when
   associated with his later experiments.

   Andrews was gone longer than I expected, returning early in November,
   almost four months later; and when he did arrive, I was quite anxious
   to see him, since my condition was at last on the brink of becoming
   noticeable. I had reached a point where I must seek absolute privacy to
   keep from being discovered. But my anxiety was slight as compared with
   his exuberance over a certain new plan he had hatched while in the
   Indies - a plan to be carried out with the aid of a curious drug he had
   learned of from a native "doctor" in Haiti. When he explained that his
   idea concerned me, I became somewhat alarmed; though in my position
   there could be little to make my plight worse. I had, indeed,
   considered more than once the oblivion that would come with a revolver
   or a plunge from the roof to the jagged rocks below.

   On the day after his arrival, in the seclusion of the dimly lit study,
   he outlined the whole grisly scheme. He had found in Haiti a drug, the
   formula for which he would develop later, which induced a state of
   profound sleep in anyone taking it; a trance so deep that death was
   closely counterfeited - with all muscular reflexes, even the
   respiration and heart-beat, completely stilled for the time being.
   Andrews had, he said, seen it demonstrated on natives many times. Some
   of them remained somnolent for days at a time, wholly immobile and as
   much like death as death itself. This suspended animation, he explained
   further, would even pass the closest examination of any medical man. He
   himself, according to all known laws, would have to report as dead a
   man under the influence of such a drug. He stated, too, that the
   subject's body assumed the precise appearance of a corpse - even a
   slight rigor mortis developing in prolonged cases.

   For some time his purpose did not seem wholly clear, but when the full
   import of his words became apparent I felt weak and nauseated. Yet in
   another way I was relieved; for the thing meant at least a partial
   escape from my curse, an escape from the banishment and shame of an
   ordinary death of the dread leprosy. Briefly, his plan was to
   administer a strong dose of the drug to me and call the local
   authorities, who would immediately pronounce me dead, and see that I
   was buried within a very short while. He felt assured that with their
   careless examination they would fail to notice my leprosy symptoms,
   which in truth had hardly appeared. Only a trifle over fifteen months
   had passed since I had caught the disease, whereas the corruption takes
   seven years to run its entire course.

   Later, he said, would come resurrection. After my interment in the
   family graveyard - beside my centuried dwelling and barely a
   quarter-mile from his own ancient pile - the appropriate steps would be
   taken. Finally, when my estate was settled and my decease widely known,
   he would secretly open the tomb and bring me to his own abode again,
   still alive and none the worse for my adventure. It seemed a ghastly
   and daring plan, but to me it offered the only hope for even a partial
   freedom; so I accepted his proposition, but not without a myriad of
   misgivings. What if the effect of the drug should wear off while I was
   in my tomb? What if the coroner should discover the awful ruse, and
   fail to inter me? These were some of the hideous doubts which assailed
   me before the experiment. Though death would have been a release from
   my curse, I feared it even worse than the yellow scourge; feared it
   even when I could see its black wings constantly hovering over me.

   Fortunately I was spared the horror of viewing my own funeral and
   burial rites. They must, however, have gone just as Andrews had
   planned, even to the subsequent disinterment; for after the initial
   dose of the poison from Haiti I lapsed into a semi-paralytic state and
   from that to a profound, night-black sleep. The drug had been
   administered in my room, and Andrews had told me before giving it that
   he would recommend to the coroner a verdict of heart failure due to
   nerve strain. Of course, there was no embalming - Andrews saw to that -
   and the whole procedure, leading up to my secret transportation from
   the graveyard to his crumbling manor, covered a period of three days.
   Having been buried late in the afternoon of the third day, my body was
   secured by Andrews that very night. He had replaced the fresh sod just
   as it had been when the workmen left. Old Simes, sworn to secrecy, had
   helped Andrews in his ghoulish task.

   Later I had lain for over a week in my old familiar bed. Owing to some
   unexpected effect of the drug, my whole body was completely paralyzed,
   so that I could move my head only slightly. All my senses, however,
   were fully alert, and by another week's time I was able to take
   nourishment in good quantities. Andrews explained that my body would
   gradually regain its former sensibilities; though owing to the presence
   of the leprosy it might take considerable time. He seemed greatly
   interested in analyzing my daily symptoms, and always asked if there
   was any feeling present in my body.

   Many days passed before I was able to control any part of my anatomy,
   and much longer before the paralysis crept from my enfeebled limbs so
   that I could feel the ordinary bodily reactions. Lying and staring at
   my numb hulk was like having it injected with a perpetual anesthetic.
   There was a total alienation I could not understand, considering that
   my head and neck were quite alive and in good health.

   Andrews explained that he had revived my upper half first and could not
   account for the complete bodily paralysis; though my condition seemed
   to trouble him little considering the damnably intent interest he
   centered upon my reactions and stimuli from the very beginning. Many
   times during lulls in our conversation I would catch a strange gleam in
   his eyes as he viewed me on the couch - a glint of victorious
   exultation which, queerly enough, he never voiced aloud; though he
   seemed to be quite glad that I had run the gauntlet of death and had
   come through alive. Still, there was that horror I was to meet in less
   than six years, which added to my desolation and melancholy during the
   tedious days in which I awaited the return of normal bodily functions.
   But I would be up and about, he assured me, before very long, enjoying
   an existence few men had ever experienced. The words did not, however,
   impress me with their true and ghastly meaning until many days later.

   During that awful siege in bed Andrews and I became somewhat estranged.
   He no longer treated me so much like a friend as like an implement in
   his skilled and greedy fingers. I found him possessed of unexpected
   traits - little examples of baseness and cruelty, apparent even to the
   hardened Simes, which disturbed me in a most unusual manner. Often he
   would display extraordinary cruelty to live specimens in his
   laboratory, for he was constantly carrying on various hidden projects
   in glandular and muscular transplantation on guinea-pigs and rabbits.
   He had also been employing his newly discovered sleepingpotion in
   curious experiments with suspended animation. But of these things he
   told me very little; though old Simes often let slip chance comments
   which shed some light on the proceedings. I was not certain how much
   the old servant knew, but he had surely learned considerable, being a
   constant companion to both Andrews and myself.

   With the passage of time, a slow but consistent feeling began creeping
   into my disabled body; and at the reviving symptoms Andrews took a
   fanatical interest in my case. He still seemed more coldly analytical
   than sympathetic toward me, taking my pulse and heart-beat with more
   than usual zeal. Occasionally, in his fevered examinations, I saw his
   hands tremble slightly - an uncommon sight with so skilled a surgeon -
   but he seemed oblivious of my scrutiny. I was never allowed even a
   momentary glimpse of my full body, but with the feeble return of the
   sense of touch, I was aware of a bulk and heaviness which at first
   seemed awkward and unfamiliar.

   Gradually I regained the use of my hands and arms; and with the passing
   of the paralysis came a new and terrible sensation of physical
   estrangement. My limbs had difficulty in following the commands of my
   mind, and every movement was jerky and uncertain. So clumsy were my
   hands, that I had to become accustomed to them all over again. This
   must, I thought, be due to my disease and the advance of the contagion
   in my system. Being unaware of how the early symptoms affected the
   victim (my brother's being a more advanced case), I had no means of
   judging; and since Andrews shunned the subject, I deemed it better to
   remain silent.

   One day I asked Andrews - I no longer considered him a friend - if I
   might try rising and sitting up in bed. At first he objected
   strenuously, but later, after cautioning me to keep the blankets well
   up around my chin so that I would not be chilled, he permitted it. This
   seemed strange, in view of the comfortable temperature. Now that late
   autumn was slowly turning into winter, the room was always well heated.
   A growing chilliness at night, and occasional glimpses of a leaden sky
   through the window, had told me of the changing season; for no calendar
   was ever in sight upon the dingy walls. With the gentle help of Simes I
   was eased to a sitting position, Andrews coldly watching from the door
   to the laboratory. At my success a slow smile spread across his leering
   features, and he turned to disappear from the darkened doorway. His
   mood did nothing to improve my condition. Old Simes, usually so regular
   and consistent, was now often late in his duties, sometimes leaving me
   alone for hours at a time.

   The terrible sense of alienation was heightened by my new position. It
   seemed that the legs and arms inside my gown were hardly able to follow
   the summoning of my mind, and it became mentally exhausting to continue
   movement for any length of time. My fingers, woefully clumsy, were
   wholly unfamiliar to my inner sense of touch, and I wondered vaguely if
   I were to be accursed the rest of my days with an awkwardness induced
   by my dread malady.

   It was on the evening following my half-recovery that the dreams began.
   I was tormented not only at night but during the day as well. I would
   awaken, screaming horribly, from some frightful nightmare I dared not
   think about outside the realm of sleep. These dreams consisted mainly
   of ghoulish things; graveyards at night, stalking corpses, and lost
   souls amid a chaos of blinding light and shadow. The terrible reality
   of the visions disturbed me most of all: it seemed that some inside
   influence was inducing the grisly vistas of moonlit tombstones and
   endless catacombs of the restless dead. I could not place their source;
   and at the end of a week I was quite frantic with abominable thoughts
   which seemed to obtrude themselves upon my unwelcome consciousness.

   By that time a slow plan was forming whereby I might escape the living
   hell into which I had been propelled. Andrews cared less and less about
   me, seeming intent only on my progress and growth and recovery of
   normal muscular reactions. I was becoming every day more convinced of
   the nefarious doings going on in that laboratory across the threshold -
   the animal cries were shocking, and rasped hideously on my overwrought
   nerves. And I was gradually beginning to think that Andrews had not
   saved me from deportation solely for my own benefit, but for some
   accursed reason of his own. Simes's attention was slowly becoming
   slighter and slighter, and I was convinced that the aged servitor had a
   hand in the deviltry somewhere. Andrews no longer eyed me as a friend,
   but as an object of experimentation; nor did I like the way he fingered
   his scalpel when he stood in the narrow doorway and stared at me with
   crafty alertness. I had never before seen such a transformation come
   over any man. His ordinarily handsome features were now lined and
   whisker-grown, and his eyes gleamed as if some imp of Satan were
   staring from them. His cold, calculating gaze made me shudder horribly,
   and gave me a fresh determination to free myself from his bondage as
   soon as possible.

   I had lost track of time during my dream-orgy, and had no way of
   knowing how fast the days were passing. The curtains were often drawn
   in the daytime, the room being lit by waxen cylinders in the large
   candelabrum. It was a nightmare of living horror and unreality; though
   through it all I was gradually becoming stronger. I always gave careful
   responses to Andrews' inquiries concerning my returning physical
   control, concealing the fact that a new life was vibrating through me
   with every passing day - an altogether strange sort of strength, but
   one which I was counting on to serve me in the coming crisis.

   Finally, one chilly evening when the candles had been extinguished, and
   a pale shaft of moonlight fell through the dark curtains upon my bed, I
   determined to rise and carry out my plan of action. There had been no
   movement from either of my captors for several hours, and I was
   confident that both were asleep in adjoining bedchambers. Shifting my
   cumbersome weight carefully, I rose to a sitting position and crawled
   cautiously out of bed, down upon the floor. A vertigo gripped me
   momentarily, and a wave of weakness flooded my entire being. But
   finally strength returned, and by clutching at a bed-post I was able to
   stand upon my feet for the first time in many months. Gradually a new
   strength coursed through me, and I donned the dark robe which I had
   seen hanging on a nearby chair. It was quite long, but served as a
   cloak over my nightdress. Again came that feeling of awful
   unfamiliarity which I had experienced in bed; that sense of alienation,
   and of difficulty in making my limbs perform as they should. But there
   was need for haste before my feeble strength might give out. As a last
   precaution in dressing, I slipped some old shoes over my feet; but
   though I could have sworn they were my own, they seemed abnormally
   loose, so that I decided they must belong to the aged Simes.

   Seeing no other heavy objects in the room, I seized from the table the
   huge candelabrum, upon which the moon shone with a pallid glow, and
   proceeded very quietly toward the laboratory door.

   My first steps came jerkily and with much difficulty, and in the
   semi-darkness I was unable to make my way very rapidly. When I reached
   the threshold, a glance within revealed my former friend seated in a
   large overstuffed chair; while beside him was a smoking-stand upon
   which were assorted bottles and a glass. He reclined half-way in the
   moonlight through the large window, and his greasy features were
   creased in a drunken smirk. An opened book lay in his lap - one of the
   hideous tomes from his private library.

   For a long moment I gloated over the prospect before me, and then,
   stepping forward suddenly, I brought the heavy weapon down upon his
   unprotected head. The dull crunch was followed by a spurt of blood, and
   the fiend crumpled to the floor, his head laid half open. I felt no
   contrition at taking the man's life in such a manner. In the hideous,
   half-visible specimens of his surgical wizardry scattered about the
   room in various stages of completion and preservation, I felt there was
   enough evidence to blast his soul without my aid. Andrews had gone too
   far in his practices to continue living, and as one of his monstrous
   specimens - of that I was now hideously certain - it was my duty to
   exterminate him. Simes, I realized, would be no such easy matter;
   indeed, only unusual good fortune had caused me to find Andrews
   unconscious. When I finally reeled up to the servant's bedchamber door,
   faint from exhaustion, I knew it would take all my remaining strength
   to complete the ordeal.

   The old man's room was in utmost darkness, being on the north side of
   the structure, but he must have seen me silhouetted in the doorway as I
   came in. He screamed hoarsely, and I aimed the candelabrum at him from
   the threshold. It struck something soft, making a sloughing sound in
   the darkness; but the screaming continued. From that time on events
   became hazy and jumbled together, but I remember grappling with the man
   and choking the life from him little by little. He gibbered a host of
   awful things before I could lay hands on him - cried and begged for
   mercy from my clutching fingers. I hardly realized my own strength in
   that mad moment which left Andrews' associate in a condition like his
   own.

   Retreating from the darkened chamber, I stumbled for the stairway door,
   sagged through it, and somehow reached the landing below. No lamps were
   burning, and my only light was a filtering of moonbeams coming from the
   narrow windows in the hall. But I made my jerky way over the cold, damp
   slabs of stone, reeling from the terrible weakness of my exertion, and
   reached the front door after ages of fumbling and crawling about in the
   darkness.

   Vague memories and haunting shadows came to taunt me in that ancient
   hallway; shadows once friendly and understandable, but now grown alien
   and unrecognizable, so that I stumbled down the worn steps in a frenzy
   of something more than fear. For a moment I stood in the shadow of the
   giant stone manor, viewing the moonlit trail down which I must go to
   reach the home of my forefathers, only a quarter of a mile distant. But
   the way seemed long, and for a while I despaired of ever traversing the
   whole of it.

   At last I grasped a piece of dead wood as a cane and set out down the
   winding road. Ahead, seemingly only a few rods away in the moonlight,
   stood the venerable mansion where my ancestors had lived and died. Its
   turrets rose spectrally in the shimmering radiance, and the black
   shadow cast on the beetling hillside appeared to shift and waver, as if
   belonging to a castle of unreal substance. There stood the monument of
   half a century; a haven for all my family old and young, which I had
   deserted many years ago to live with the fanatical Andrews. It stood
   empty on that fateful night, and I hope that it may always remain so.

   In some manner I reached the aged place; though I do not remember the
   last half of the journey at all. It was enough to be near the family
   cemetery, among whose moss-covered and crumbling stones I would seek
   the oblivion I had desired. As I approached the moonlit spot the old
   familiarity - so absent during my abnormal existence - returned to
   plague me in a wholly unexpected way. I drew close to my own tombstone,
   and the feeling of homecoming grew stronger; with it came a fresh flood
   of that awful sense of alienation and disembodiment which I knew so
   well. I was satisfied that the end was drawing near; nor did I stop to
   analyze emotions till a little later, when the full horror of my
   position burst upon me.

   Intuitively I knew my own tombstone; for the grass had scarcely begun
   to grow between the pieces of sod. With feverish haste I began clawing
   at the mound, and scraping the wet earth from the hole left by the
   removal of the grass and roots. How long I worked in the nitrous soil
   before my fingers struck the coffin-lid, I can never say; but sweat was
   pouring from me and my nails were but useless, bleeding hooks.

   At last I threw out the last bit of loose earth, and with trembling
   fingers tugged on the heavy lid. It gave a trifle; and I was prepared
   to lift it completely open when a fetid and nauseous odor assailed my
   nostrils. I started erect, horrified. Had some idiot placed my
   tombstone on the wrong grave, causing me to unearth another body? For
   surely there could be no mistaking that awful stench. Gradually a
   hideous uncertainty came over me and I scrambled from the hole. One
   look at the newly made headpiece was enough. This was indeed my own
   grave .. . but what fool had buried within it another corpse?

   All at once a bit of the unspeakable truth propelled itself upon my
   brain. The odor, in spite of its putrescence, seemed somehow familiar -
   horribly familiar. . . . Yet I could not credit my senses with such an
   idea. Reeling and cursing, I fell into the black cavity once more, and
   by the aid of a hastily lit match, lifted the long lid completely open.
   Then the light went out, as if extinguished by a malignant hand, and I
   clawed my way out of that accursed pit, screaming in a frenzy of fear
   and loathing.

   When I regained consciousness I was lying before the door of my own
   ancient manor, where I must have crawled after that hideous rendezvous
   in the family cemetery. I realized that dawn was close at hand, and
   rose feebly, opening the aged portal before me and entering the place
   which had known no footsteps for over a decade. A fever was ravaging my
   weakened body, so that I was hardly able to stand, but I made my way
   slowly through the musty, dimly lit chambers and staggered into my own
   study - the study I had deserted so many years before.

   When the sun has risen, I shall go to the ancient well beneath the old
   willow tree by the cemetery and cast my deformed self into it. No other
   man shall ever view this blasphemy which has survived life longer than
   it should have. I do not know what people will say when they see my
   disordered grave, but this will not trouble me if I can find oblivion
   from that which I beheld amidst the crumbling, mosscrusted stones of
   the hideous place.

   I know now why Andrews was so secretive in his actions; so damnably
   gloating in his attitude toward me after my artificial death. He had
   meant me for a specimen all the time - a specimen of his greatest feat
   of surgery, his masterpiece of unclean witchery . . . an example of
   perverted artistry for him alone to see. Where Andrews obtained that
   other with which I lay accursed in his moldering mansion I shall
   probably never know; but I am afraid that it was brought from Haiti
   along with his fiendish medicine. At least these long hairy arms and
   horrible short legs are alien to me ... alien to all natural and sane
   laws of mankind. The thought that I shall be tortured with that other
   during the rest of my brief existence is another hell.

   Now I can but wish for that which once was mine; that which every man
   blessed of God ought to have at death; that which I saw in that awful
   moment in the ancient burial ground when I raised the lid on the coffin
   - my own shrunken, decayed, and headless body.

   8931The Doom That Came to SarnathH. P. Lovecraft

   There is in the land of Mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no
   stream, and out of which no stream flows. Ten thousand years ago there
   stood by its shore the mighty city of Sarnath, but Sarnath stands there
   no more.

   It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young,
   before ever the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city
   stood beside the lake; the gray stone city of Ib, which was old as the
   lake itself, and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold. Very odd
   and ugly were these beings, as indeed are most beings of a world yet
   inchoate and rudely fashioned. It is written on the brick cylinders of
   Kadatheron that the beings of Ib were in hue as green as the lake and
   the mists that rise above it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting,
   flabby lips, and curious ears, and were without voice. It is also
   written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist; they and
   the vast still lake and gray stone city Ib. However this may be, it is
   certain that they worshipped a sea-green stone idol chiseled in the
   likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard; before which they danced
   horribly when the moon was gibbous. And it is written in the papyrus of
   Ilarnek, that they one day discovered fire, and thereafter kindled
   flames on many ceremonial occasions. But not much is written of these
   beings, because they lived in very ancient times, and man is young, and
   knows but little of the very ancient living things.

   After many eons men came to the land of Mnar, dark shepherd folk with
   their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the
   winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed
   on to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious
   metals were found in the earth.

   Not far from the gray city of Ib did the wandering tribes lay the first
   stones of Sarnath, and at the beings of Ib they marveled greatly. But
   with their marveling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that
   beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk. Nor
   did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of Ib, for
   why those sculptures lingered so late in the world, even until the
   coming men, none can tell; unless it was because the land of Mnar is
   very still, and remote from most other lands, both of waking and of
   dream.

   As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of Ib their hate grew,
   and it was not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as
   jelly to the touch of stones and arrows. So one day the young warriors,
   the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen, marched against Ib and
   slew all the inhabitants thereof, pushing the queer bodies into the
   lake with long spears, because they did not wish to touch them. And
   because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of Ib they cast
   these also into the lake; wondering from the greatness of the labor how
   ever the stones were brought from afar, as they must have been, since
   there is naught like them in the land of Mnar or in the lands adjacent.

   Thus of the very ancient city of Ib was nothing spared, save the
   sea-green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the
   water-lizard. This the young warriors took back with them as a symbol
   of conquest over the old gods and beings of Ib, and as a sign of
   leadership in Mnar. But on the night after it was set up in the temple,
   a terrible thing must have happened, for weird lights were seen over
   the lake, and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the
   high-priest Taran-Ish lying dead, as from some fear unspeakable. And
   before he died, Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite
   with coarse shaky strokes the sign of DOOM.

   After Taran-Ish there were many high-priests in Sarnath but never was
   the sea-green stone idol found. And many centuries came and went,
   wherein Sarnath prospered exceedingly, so that only priests and old
   women remembered what Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of
   chrysolite. Betwixt Sarnath and the city of Ilarnek arose a caravan
   route, and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other
   metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers
   and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along
   the winding river Ai and beyond. So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned
   and beautiful, and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the
   neighboring cities; and in time there sat upon a throne in Sarnath the
   kings of all the land of Mnar and of many lands adjacent.

   The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the
   magnificent. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in
   height three hundred cubits and in breadth seventy-five, so that
   chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top. For
   full five hundred stadia did they run, being open only on the side
   toward the lake where a green stone sea-wall kept back the waves that
   rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of Ib. In
   Sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans,
   and fifty more intersecting them. With onyx were they paved, save those
   whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod, which were paved with
   granite. And the gates of Sarnath were as many as the landward ends of
   the streets, each of bronze, and flanked by the figures of lions and
   elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men. The houses
   of Sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony, each having its walled
   garden and crystal lakelet. With strange art were they builded, for no
   other city had houses like them; and travelers from Thraa and Ilarnek
   and Kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were
   surmounted.

   But more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples, and the
   gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the
   last of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron.
   So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath
   only the sky; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dother
   their walls showed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendor at
   once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder. Many were the pillars of
   the palaces, all of tinted marble, and carven into designs of
   surpassing beauty. And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics
   of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice
   materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking
   over beds of the rarest flowers. And there were likewise fountains,
   which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning
   art. Outshining all others was the palace of the kings of Mnar and of
   the lands adjacent. On a pair of golden crouching lions rested the
   throne, many steps above the gleaming floor. And it was wrought of one
   piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece
   could have come. In that palace there were also many galleries, and
   many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the
   pleasure of the kings. Sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with
   water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts, and then were enacted
   stirring sea-fights, or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine
   things.

   Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath,
   fashioned of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere. A full
   thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the
   high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the
   kings. On the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the
   palaces; where gathered throngs in worship of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and
   Lobon, the chief gods of Sarnath, whose incense-enveloped shrines were
   as the thrones of monarchs. Not like the eikons of other gods were
   those of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon. For so close to life were they
   that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the
   ivory thrones. And up unending steps of zircon was the tower-chamber,
   wherefrom the high-priests looked out over the city and the plains and
   the lake by day; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and
   planets, and their reflections in the lake, at night. Here was done the
   very secret and ancient rite in detestation of Bokrug, the
   water-lizard, and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the
   Doom-scrawl of Taran-Ish.

   Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. In
   the center of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by
   a high wall. And they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass,
   through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear, and
   from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and
   planets when it was not clear. In summer the gardens were cooled with
   fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans, and in winter they were
   heated with concealed fires, so that in those gardens it was always
   spring. There ran little streams over bright pebbles, dividing meads of
   green and gardens of many hues, and spanned by a multitude of bridges.
   Many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the hued
   lakelets into which they expanded. Over the streams and lakelets rode
   white swans, whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody
   of the waters. In ordered terraces rose the green banks, adorned here
   and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms, and seats and
   benches of marble and porphyry. And there were many small shrines and
   temples where one might rest or pray to small gods.

   Each year there was celebrated in Sarnath the feast of the destroying
   of Ib, at which time wine, song, dancing, and merriment of every kind
   abounded. Great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had
   annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and
   of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with
   roses from the gardens of Zokkar. And the kings would look out over the
   lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it.

   At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had
   descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had
   vanished, and how Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning. And
   they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath
   the waters of the lake. But as many years passed without calamity even
   the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the
   feasters. Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often
   performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug,
   the water-lizard? And a thousand years of riches and delight passed
   over Sarnath, wonder of the world.

   Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the
   destroying of Ib. For a decade had it been talked of in the land of
   Mnar, and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels
   and elephants men from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadetheron, and all the
   cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. Before the marble walls on the
   appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of
   travelers. Within his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king,
   drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered Pnoth, and
   surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. There were eaten
   many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the distant hills
   of Linplan, heels of camels from the Bnazic desert, nuts and spices
   from Sydathrian groves, and pearls from wave-washed Mtal dissolved in
   the vinegar of Thraa. Of sauces there were an untold number, prepared
   by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of every
   feaster. But most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from
   the lake, each of vast size, and served upon golden platters set with
   rubies and diamonds.

   Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed
   the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted
   elsewhere. In the tower of the great temple the priests held revels,
   and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands
   made merry. And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the
   shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the
   damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to
   shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath.
   Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange
   lights on the water, and saw that the gray rock Akurion, which was wont
   to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged. And fear
   grew vaguely yet swiftly, so that the princes of Ilarnek and of far
   Rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed,
   though they scarce knew the reason for their departing.

   Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath
   burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the
   plain, so that all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in
   fright. For on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of
   horror unendurable, and on their tongues were words so terrible that no
   hearer paused for proof. Men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked
   aloud of the sight within the king's banquet-hall, where through the
   windows were seen no longer the forms of Nargis-Hei and his nobles and
   slaves, but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with
   bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears; things which
   danced horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies
   and diamonds and containing uncouth flames. And the princes and
   travelers, as they fled from the doomed city of Sarnath on horses and
   camels and elephants, looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw
   the gray rock Akurion was quite submerged. Through all the land of Mnar
   and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from
   Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals
   no more. It was long ere any travelers went thither, and even then only
   the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes, who
   are no kin to the men of Mnar. These men indeed went to the lake to
   view Sarnath; but though they found the vast still lake itself, and the
   gray rock Akurion which rears high above it near the shore, they beheld
   not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind. Where once had
   risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher, now
   stretched only the marshy shore, and where once had dwelt fifty million
   of men now crawled the detestable water-lizard. Not even the mines of
   precious metal remained. DOOM had come to Sarnath.

   But half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol; an
   exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great
   water-lizard. That idol, enshrined in the high temple at Ilarnek, was
   subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of
   Mnar.

   The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is a novella by H. P. Lovecraft. It
   was completed in 1927 and was unpublished in his lifetime. It is both
   the longest of the stories that comprise his Dream Cycle and the
   longest of his stories to feature protagonist Randolph Carter. The
   story was published by Arkham House in 1943.
   9935The Dream-Quest of Unknown KadathH.P. Lovecraft1943

   Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three
   times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace
   above it. All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset, with walls,
   temples, colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble, silver-basined
   fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and
   wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and
   ivory statues in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed
   tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of
   grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods, a fanfare of supernal
   trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as
   clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood
   breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to
   him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished memory, the pain of
   lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an
   awesome and momentous place.

   He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in
   what cycle or incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in
   waking, he could not tell. Vaguely it called up glimpses of a far
   forgotten first youth, when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery
   of days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager
   sound of lutes and song, unclosing fiery gates toward further and
   surprising marvels. But each night as he stood on that high marble
   terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that
   hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the
   bondage of dream's tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that
   lofty spot, or descend the wide marmoreal flights flung endlessly down
   to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning.

   When for the third time he awakened with those flights still
   undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed, he
   prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood
   capricious above the clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where
   no man treads. But the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor
   did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and
   invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of Nasht and
   Kaman-Thah, whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far
   from the gates of the waking world. It seemed, however, that his
   prayers must have been adversely heard, for after even the first of
   them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city; as if his three
   glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights, and against
   some hidden plan or wish of the gods.

   At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and
   cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or
   waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to go with bold
   entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts
   through the dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned
   with unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of
   the Great Ones.

   In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame
   and talked of this design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah.
   And the priests shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be
   the death of his soul. They pointed out that the Great Ones had shown
   already their wish, and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed
   by insistent pleas. They reminded him, too, that not only had no man
   ever been to Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in what part of
   space it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world,
   or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or
   Aldebaran. If in our dreamland, it might conceivably be reached, but
   only three human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed
   the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands, and of that three, two had
   come back quite mad. There were, in such voyages, incalculable local
   dangers; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers
   unmentionably outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach; that
   last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and
   bubbles at the centre of all infinity--the boundless daemon sultan
   Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily
   in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled,
   maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of
   accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly,
   awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic Ultimate gods, the blind,
   voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other gods whose soul and messenger is
   the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah
   in the cavern of flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on
   unknown Kadath in the cold waste, wherever that might be, and to win
   from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous
   sunset city. He knew that his journey would be strange and long, and
   that the Great Ones would be against it; but being old in the land of
   dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him. So
   asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his
   course, he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the Gate of
   Deeper Slumber and set out through the Enchanted Wood.

   In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine
   groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi,
   dwell the furtive and secretive Zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of
   the dream world and a few of the waking world, since the wood at two
   places touches the lands of men, though it would be disastrous to say
   where. Certain unexplained rumours, events, and vanishments occur among
   men where the Zoogs have access, and it is well that they cannot travel
   far outside the world of dreams. But over the nearer parts of the dream
   world they pass freely, flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing
   back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the
   forest they love. Most of them live in burrows, but some inhabit the
   trunks of the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is
   muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat, either physical
   or spiritual, for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who
   have not come out. Carter, however, had no fear; for he was an old
   dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty
   with them; having found through their help the splendid city of
   Celephais in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, where reigns half
   the year the great King Kuranes, a man he had known by another name in
   life. Kuranes was the one soul who had been to the star-gulfs and
   returned free from madness.

   Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic
   trunks, Carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the Zoogs, and
   listened now and then for responses. He remembered one particular
   village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood, where a circle
   of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and
   more terrible dwellers long forgotten, and toward this spot he
   hastened. He traced his way by the grotesque fungi, which always seem
   better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings
   danced and sacrificed. Finally the great light of those thicker fungi
   revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof
   of the forest and out of sight. This was the nearest of the great ring
   of stones, and Carter knew he was close to the Zoog village. Renewing
   his fluttering sound, he waited patiently; and was at last rewarded by
   an impression of many eyes watching him. It was the Zoogs, for one sees
   their weird eyes long before one can discern their small, slippery
   brown outlines.

   Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the
   whole dim-litten region was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones
   brushed Carter unpleasantly, and one even nipped loathsomely at his
   ear; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders.
   The Council of Sages, recognizing the visitor, offered a gourd of
   fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others, which had grown
   from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon; and as Carter drank it
   ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began. The Zoogs did not,
   unfortunately, know where the peak of Kadath lies, nor could they even
   say whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another. Rumours
   of the Great Ones came equally from all points; and one might only say
   that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in
   valleys, since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is
   above and the clouds beneath.

   Then one very ancient Zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others;
   and said that in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai, there still lingered
   the last copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by
   waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of
   dreams when the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olathoe
   and slew all the heroes of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts he
   said, told much of the gods, and besides, in Ulthar there were men who
   had seen the signs of the gods, and even one old priest who had scaled
   a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight. He had failed,
   though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly.

   So Randolph Carter thanked the Zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave
   him another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out
   through the phosphorescent wood for the other side, where the rushing
   Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir and
   Ulthar dot the plain. Behind him, furtive and unseen, crept several of
   the curious Zoogs; for they wished to learn what might befall him, and
   bear back the legend to their people. The vast oaks grew thicker as he
   pushed on beyond the village, and he looked sharply for a certain spot
   where they would thin somewhat, standing quite dead or dying among the
   unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their
   fallen brothers. There he would turn sharply aside, for at that spot a
   mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor; and those who have
   dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide.
   Remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks, and what it was
   possibly set up for, the Zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab
   with its huge ring; for they realise that all which is forgotten need
   not necessarily be dead, and they would not like to see the slab rise
   slowly and deliberately.

   Carter detoured at the proper place, and heard behind him the
   frightened fluttering of some of the more timid Zoogs. He had known
   they would follow him, so he was not disturbed; for one grows
   accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures. It was twilight
   when he came to the edge of the wood, and the strengthening glow told
   him it was the twilight of morning. Over fertile plains rolling down to
   the Skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys, and on every hand were
   the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land.
   Once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the
   dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous Zoogs that crept through
   the grass behind. At another house, where people were stirring, he
   asked questions about the gods, and whether they danced often upon
   Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder Sign and
   tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar.

   At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he
   had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this
   direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across
   the Skai, into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human
   sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the
   other side, the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs
   at the trailing Zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of Ulthar; for in
   Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a
   cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green
   cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint
   town itself, with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories
   and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see
   old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the
   cats being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen Zoogs, picked his way
   directly to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and
   old records were said to be; and once within that venerable circular
   tower of ivied stone--which crowns Ulthar's highest hill--he sought out
   the patriarch Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kla in
   the stony desert and had come down again alive.

   Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the
   temple, was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and
   memory. From him Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly
   that they are indeed only Earth's gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland
   and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said,
   heed a man's prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of
   climbing to their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste. It was
   lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending
   it would be very grave. Atal's companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn
   screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of
   Hatheg-Kia. With unknown Kadath, if ever found, matters would be much
   worse; for although Earth's gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise
   mortal, they are protected by the Other Gods from Outside, whom it is
   better not to discuss. At least twice in the world's history the Other
   Gods set their seal upon Earth's primal granite; once in antediluvian
   times, as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the Pnakotic
   Manuscripts too ancient to be read, and once on Hatheg-Kia when Barzai
   the Wise tried to see Earth's gods dancing by moonlight. So, Atal said,
   it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful
   prayers.

   Carter, though disappointed by Atal's discouraging advice and by the
   meagre help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven
   Cryptical Books of Hsan, did not wholly despair. First he questioned
   the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed
   terrace, thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods' aid;
   but Atal could tell him nothing. Probably, Atal said, the place
   belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general land of
   vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet.
   In that case Earth's gods could not guide him if they would. But this
   was not likely, since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly
   that it was something the Great Ones wished to hide from him.

   Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many
   draughts of the moon-wine which the Zoogs had given him that the old
   man became irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his reserve, poor Atal
   babbled freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported
   by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on
   the isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea, and hinting that it may be a
   likeness which Earth's gods once wrought of their own features in the
   days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he hiccoughed
   likewise that the features of that image are very strange, so that one
   might easily recognize them, and that they are sure signs of the
   authentic race of the gods.

   Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to
   Carter. It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones
   often espouse the daughters of men, so that around the borders of the
   cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their
   blood. This being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the
   stone face on Ngranek and mark the features; then, having noted them
   with care, to search for such features among living men. Where they are
   plainest and thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever
   stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that
   wherein stands Kadath.

   Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions, and those with
   their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker. They
   might not know their parentage, for the gods so dislike to be known
   among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly; a
   thing which Carter realized even as he sought to scale Kadath. But they
   would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows, and
   would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the
   dreamland that common folk would call them fools; and from all this one
   could perhaps learn old secrets of Kadath, or gain hints of the
   marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret. And more, one might
   in certain cases seize some well-loved child of a god as hostage; or
   even capture some young god himself, disguised and dwelling amongst men
   with a comely peasant maiden as his bride.

   Atal, however, did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab;
   and recommended that Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges
   down to the Southern Sea; where no burgess of Ulthar has ever been, but
   whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and
   two-wheeled carts. There is a great city there, Dylath-Leen, but in
   Ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys
   that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore. The traders
   that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human, or
   nearly so, but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought
   wholesome in Ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from
   unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited.

   By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy, and
   Carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long
   beard decorously on his chest. As he turned to go, he observed that no
   suppressed fluttering followed him, and wondered why the Zoogs had
   become so lax in their curious pursuit. Then he noticed all the sleek
   complacent cats of Ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto, and
   recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard, in lower
   parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest's conversation. He
   recalled, too, the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent
   young Zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street
   outside. And because he loved nothing on earth more than small black
   kittens, he stooped and petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked
   their chops, and did not mourn because those inquisitive Zoogs would
   escort him no farther.

   It was sunset now, so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep
   little street overlooking the lower town. And as he went out on the
   balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and
   cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond, all mellow and magical in
   the slanted light, he swore that Ulthar would be a very likely place to
   dwell in always, were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever
   goading one onward toward unknown perils. Then twilight fell, and the
   pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic, and little
   yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows. And sweet
   bells pealed in. the temple tower above, and the first star winked
   softly above the meadows across the Skai. With the night came song, and
   Carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the
   filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of simple Ulthar. And there
   might have been sweetness even in the voices of Ulthar's many cats, but
   that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting. Some of
   them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats
   and which villagers say are on the moon's dark side, whither the cats
   leap from tall housetops, but one small black kitten crept upstairs and
   sprang in Carter's lap to purr and play, and curled up near his feet
   when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed
   with fragrant, drowsy herbs.

   In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for
   Dylath-Leen with the spun wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthar's
   busy farms. And for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the
   smooth road beside the Skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little
   quaint fishing towns, and on other nights camping under the stars while
   snatches of boatmen's songs came from the placid river. The country was
   very beautiful, with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked
   cottages and octagonal windmills.

   On the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead, and then
   the tall black towers of Dylath-Leen, which is built mostly of basalt.
   Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a
   bit of the Giant's Causeway, and its streets are dark and uninviting.
   There are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves, and all the
   town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of
   a few which are said to be not on earth. Carter questioned the oddly
   robed men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab,
   and found that they knew of it well.

   Ships came from Baharna on that island, one being due to return thither
   in only a month, and Ngranek is but two days' zebra-ride from that
   port. But few had seen the stone face of the god, because it is on a
   very difficult side of Ngranek, which overlooks only sheer crags and a
   valley of sinister lava. Once the gods were angered with men on that
   side, and spoke of the matter to the Other Gods.

   It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in
   Dylath-Leen's sea taverns, because they mostly preferred to whisper of
   the black galleys. One of them was due in a week with rubies from its
   unknown shore, and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of
   the men who came from it to trade were too wide, and the way their
   turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in
   especially bad taste. And their shoes were the shortest and queerest
   ever seen in the Six Kingdoms. But worst of all was the matter of the
   unseen rowers. Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and
   accurately and vigorously to be comfortable, and it was not right for a
   ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded, yet to give
   no glimpse of its crew. It was not fair to the tavern-keepers of
   Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either; for not a scrap of
   provisions was ever sent aboard. The merchants took only gold and stout
   black slaves from Parg across the river. That was all they ever took,
   those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never
   anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black
   men of Parg whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those
   galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be
   described. Only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the
   hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them. Dylath-Leen would
   never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable
   elsewhere, but no mine in all Earth's dreamland was known to produce
   their like.

   Of these things Dylath-Leen's cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst
   Carter waited patiently for the ship from Baharna, which might bear him
   to the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren. Meanwhile
   he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any
   tales they might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a
   marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below
   terraces in the sunset. Of these things, however, he learned nothing;
   though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked
   queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of. This man was
   reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert
   plateau of Leng, which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are
   seen at night from afar. He was even rumoured to have dealt with that
   High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over
   its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. That
   such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as
   may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted, but
   Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him.

   Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and
   the tall lighthouse, silent and alien, and with a strange stench that
   the south wind drove into the town. Uneasiness rustled through the
   taverns along that waterfront, and after a while the dark wide-mouthed
   merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore
   to seek the bazaars of the jewellers. Carter observed them closely, and
   disliked them more the longer he looked at them. Then he saw them drive
   the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into
   that singular galley, and wondered in what lands--or if in any lands at
   all--those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve.

   And on the third evening of that galley's stay one of the uncomfortable
   merchants spoke to him, smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had
   heard in the taverns of Carter's quest. He appeared to have knowledge
   too secret for public telling; and although the sound of his voice was
   unbearably hateful, Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller
   must not be overlooked. He bade him therefore be his guest in locked
   chambers above, and drew out the last of the Zoogs' moon-wine to loosen
   his tongue. The strange merchant drank heavily, but smirked unchanged
   by the draught. Then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his
   own, and Carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby,
   grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended. He
   offered his wine to his host, and though Carter took only the least
   sip, he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined
   jungles. All the while the guest had been smiling more and more
   broadly, and as Carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was
   that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite
   unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban
   had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth.

   Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a
   tent-like awning on the deck of a ship, with the marvellous coasts of
   the Southern Sea flying by in unnatural swiftness. He was not chained,
   but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the
   sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did
   the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip
   past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of
   earth--a lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport--had often discoursed
   in the old days, and recognized the templed terraces of Zak, abode of
   forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of
   a thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnel gardens
   of Zura, land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of
   crystal, meeting above in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour
   of Sona-Nyl, blessed land of fancy.

   Past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely,
   urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before
   the day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal
   than the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say
   splendid Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates
   of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth's dreamland drop
   wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward
   other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered
   universe where the daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid
   pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind,
   voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and messenger
   Nyarlathotep.

   Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their
   intent, though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those
   who wished to hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of
   dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all
   these agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are
   eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for
   the favour of their hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos
   Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the merchants of the humped
   turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their
   castle of Kadath, had decided to take him away and deliver him to
   Nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a
   prize. What might be the land of those merchants in our known universe
   or in the eldritch spaces outside, Carter could not guess; nor could he
   imagine at what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling
   chaos to give him up and claim their reward. He knew, however, that no
   beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate
   nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the formless central void.

   At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and
   glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some
   hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates. Then they
   squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat
   that was passed around. But when they gave Carter a portion, he found
   something very terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned
   even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye
   was on him. And again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath, and of
   the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength
   was derived.

   It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the
   West and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from
   ahead. And the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars, and
   the deck grew damp, and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the
   brink. Then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken, and
   Carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great
   boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary space. Never before had
   he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all
   through the aether, leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass,
   and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object
   excites their curiosity. These are the nameless larvae of the Other
   Gods, and like them are blind and without mind, and possessed of
   singular hungers and thirsts.

   But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for
   he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the
   moon. The moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they
   approached it, and shewing its singular craters and peaks
   uncomfortably. The ship made for the edge, and it soon became clear
   that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is
   always turned away from earth, and which no fully human person, save
   perhaps the dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever beheld. The close aspect of
   the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter, and
   he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and
   there. The dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could
   have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods, and in the symmetries of
   the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which
   did not invite solution. And what the structure and proportions of the
   olden worshippers could have been, Carter steadily refused to
   conjecture.

   When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by
   man, there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and
   Carter saw many low, broad, round cottages in fields of grotesque
   whitish fungi. He noticed that these cottages had no windows, and
   thought that their shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux. Then he
   glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea, and knew that the voyage was
   once more to be by water--or at least through some liquid. The galley
   struck the surface with a peculiar sound, and the odd elastic way the
   waves received it was very perplexing to Carter.

   They now slid along at great speed, once passing and hailing another
   galley of kindred form, but generally seeing nothing but that curious
   sea and a sky that was black and star-strewn even though the sun shone
   scorchingly in it.

   There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast,
   and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they
   leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact
   that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner;
   and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious
   wine of that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer,
   and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the
   jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognized as akin to
   that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap
   the small brown Zoogs ferment their curious wine.

   Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves
   ahead, and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest
   them. For they were not men at all, or even approximately men, but
   great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at
   will, and whose principal shape--though it often changed--was that of a
   sort of toad without any eyes, but with a curious vibrating mass of
   short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout. These
   objects were waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and crates
   and boxes with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or
   off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws. And now and
   then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed
   were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who
   traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without turbans or shoes
   or clothing, did not seem so very human after all. Some of the
   slaves--the fatter ones, whom a sort of overseer would pinch
   experimentally--were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which
   workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering
   vans.

   Once a van was hitched and driven off, and the, fabulous thing which
   drew it was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other
   monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of
   slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven
   aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery toad-things
   as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the
   almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of
   servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking,
   fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other
   planets where they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on
   earth, for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully
   shod and turbaned, and could haggle in the shops of men without
   embarrassment or curious explanations. But most of them, unless lean or
   ill-favoured, were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in
   lumbering lorries by fabulous things. Occasionally other beings were
   unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-humans, some not so
   similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if any of the
   poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and
   shipped inland in those obnoxious drays.

   When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a
   nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of
   them seized Carter and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that
   city are beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of the
   tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey
   vertical walls without windows. At length he was dragged within a low
   doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was,
   apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark.
   The odour of the place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into
   a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and
   ascertain its form and dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty
   feet across.

   From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but
   Carter would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but
   he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and
   messenger of infinity's Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.
   Finally, after an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door
   swung wide again, and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into
   the red-litten streets of that fearsome city. It was night on the moon,
   and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches.

   In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the
   toad-things and twenty-four almost human torch-bearers, eleven on
   either side, and one each before and behind. Carter was placed in the
   middle of the line; five toad-things ahead and five behind, and one
   almost-human torch-bearer on either side of him. Certain of the
   toad-things produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made
   loathsome sounds. To that hellish piping the column advanced out of the
   tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi, soon commencing
   to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the
   city. That on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling
   chaos waited, Carter could not doubt; and he wished that the suspense
   might soon be over. The whining of those impious flutes was shocking,
   and he would have given worlds for some even half-normal sound; but
   these toad-things had no voices, and the slaves did not talk.

   Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound.
   It rolled from the higher hills, and from all the jagged peaks around
   it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus. It was
   the midnight yell of the cat, and Carter knew at last that the old
   village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical
   realms which are known only to cats, and to which the elders among cats
   repair by stealth nocturnally, springing from high housetops. Verily,
   it is to the moon's dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the
   hills and converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of
   foetid things Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of
   the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home.

   Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in
   this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that
   he need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus
   wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small
   graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call
   of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time
   even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of
   murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes
   stopped, and there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans
   screamed, and cats spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made
   never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that
   porous earth with the obscene fungi.

   It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had
   never before seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger,
   and mixed; common, Persian, and Manx; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian;
   all were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some
   trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess
   great in the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the
   throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing
   and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their
   fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and
   teeth of a divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a
   stricken slave, but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his
   loyal defenders. Then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the
   clangour of war and the shouts of the victors, and feeling the soft
   paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray.

   At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them
   again it was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth,
   thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen
   with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all
   those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one
   endless sea of cats in orderly array. Circle on circle they reached,
   and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and
   purring to him consolingly. Of the dead slaves and toad-things there
   were not many signs, but Carter thought he saw one bone a little way
   off in the open space between him and the warriors.

   Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats, and
   learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and
   often spoken of in the places where cats congregate. He had not been
   unmarked in Ulthar when he passed through, and the sleek old cats had
   remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry
   Zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten. And they recalled,
   too, how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at
   the inn, and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning
   before he left. The grandfather of that very little kitten was the
   leader of the army now assembled, for he had seen the evil procession
   from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his
   kind on earth and in the land of dream.

   A yowl now came from the farther peak, and the old leader paused
   abruptly in his conversation. It was one of the army's outposts,
   stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which
   Earth's cats fear; the very large and peculiar cats from Saturn, who
   for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon's dark
   side. They are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things, and are
   notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a
   meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter.

   After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a
   closer formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to
   take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth
   and its dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself
   be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry
   leapers, and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land
   gracefully when the rest landed. He also offered to deposit him in any
   spot he desired, and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence
   the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab
   and the carven crest Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city
   to have no more traffick with black galleys, if indeed that traffick
   could be tactfully and judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the
   cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their
   midst; while in a black cave on an unhallowed summit of the
   moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded
   by his companions Carter did not see this time the great black
   shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before
   he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at
   the inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring
   out of the window in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last
   to leave, and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get
   home by cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs and learned
   that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still
   nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during
   that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their
   infamous ways. Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the
   jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease
   trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever
   befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick, it will not be his fault.

   In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall
   lighthouse, and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of
   wholesome men, with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey
   captain in silken robes. Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab's
   inner groves, and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Baharna,
   and the strange little figures carved from Ngranek's ancient lava. For
   this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and the iridescent textiles
   of Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in
   Parg. Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and
   was told that the voyage would take ten days. And during his week of
   waiting he talked much with that captain of Ngranek, and was told that
   very few had seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are
   content to learn its legends from old people and lava-gatherers and
   image-makers in Baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they
   have indeed beheld it. The captain was not even sure that any person
   now living had beheld that carven face, for the wrong side of Ngranek
   is very difficult and barren and sinister, and there are rumours of
   caves near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain did
   not wish to say just what a night-gaunt might be like, since such
   cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who
   think too often of them. Then Carter asked that captain about unknown
   Kadath in the cold waste, and the marvellous sunset city, but of these
   the good man could truly tell nothing.

   Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide
   turned, and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of
   that dismal basalt town. And for two days they sailed eastward in sight
   of green coasts, and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed
   up steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming
   wharves and beaches where nets lay drying. But on the third day they
   turned sharply south where the roll of water was stronger, and soon
   passed from sight of any land. On the fifth day the sailors were
   nervous, but the captain apologized for their fears, saying that the
   ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a
   sunken city too old for memory, and that when the water was clear one
   could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk
   disliked it. He admitted, moreover, that many ships had been lost in
   that part of the sea; having been hailed when quite close to it, but
   never seen again.

   That night the moon was very bright, and one could see a great way down
   in the water. There was so little wind that the ship could not move
   much, and the ocean was very calm. Looking over the rail Carter saw
   many fathoms deep the dome of the great temple, and in front of it an
   avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square.
   Dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins, and porpoises
   revelled clumsily here and there, sometimes coming to the surface and
   leaping clear out of the sea. As the ship drifted on a little the floor
   of the ocean rose in hills, and one could clearly mark the lines of
   ancient climbing streets and the washed-down walls of myriad little
   houses.

   Then the suburbs appeared, and finally a great lone building on a hill,
   of simpler architecture than the other structures, and in much better
   repair. It was dark and low and covered four sides of a square, with a
   tower at each corner, a paved court in the centre, and small curious
   round windows all over it. Probably it was of basalt, though weeds
   draped the greater part; and such was its lonely and impressive place
   on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery. Some
   phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of
   shining, and Carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears.
   Then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the
   middle of that central court, and saw that something was tied to it.
   And when after getting a telescope from the captain's cabin he saw that
   that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of Oriab, head downward
   and without any eyes, he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the
   ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea.

   The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar, in
   the land of forgotten dreams, with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for
   cargo. And on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the
   isle of Oriab with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the
   distance. Oriab is a very great isle, and its port of Baharna a mighty
   city. The wharves of Baharna are of porphyry, and the city rises in
   great stone terraces behind them, having streets of steps that are
   frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings.
   There is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with
   granite gates and leads to the inland lake of Yath, on whose farther
   shore are the vast clay-brick ruins of a primal city whose name is not
   remembered. As the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin
   beacons Thon and Thal gleamed a welcome, and in all the million windows
   of Baharna's terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as
   the stars peep out overhead in the dusk, till that steep and climbing
   seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of
   heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour.

   The captain, after landing, made Carter a guest in his own small house
   on the shores of Yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and
   his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the
   traveller's delight. And in the days after that Carter asked for
   rumours and legends of Ngranek in all the taverns and public places
   where lava-gatherers and image-makers meet, but could find no one who
   had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face. Ngranek was a
   hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it, and besides, one
   could never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether
   fabulous.

   When the captain sailed back to Dylath-Leen Carter took quarters in an
   ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the
   town, which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of Yath's farther
   shore. Here he laid his plans for the ascent of Ngranek, and correlated
   all that he had learned from the lava-gatherers about the roads
   thither. The keeper of the tavern was a very old man, and had heard so
   many legends that he was a great help. He even took Carter to an upper
   room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a
   traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were
   bolder and less reluctant to visit Ngranek's higher slopes. The old
   tavern-keeper's great-grandfather had heard from his great-grandfather
   that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed Ngranek and
   seen the carven face, here drawing it for others to behold, but Carter
   had very great doubts, since the large rough features on the wall were
   hasty and careless, and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little
   companion shapes in the worst possible taste, with horns and wings and
   claws and curling tails.

   At last, having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the
   taverns and public places of Baharna, Carter hired a zebra and set out
   one morning on the road by Yath's shore for those inland parts wherein
   towers stony Ngranek. On his right were rolling hills and pleasant
   orchards and neat little stone farmhouses, and he was much reminded of
   those fertile fields that flank the Skai. By evening he was near the
   nameless ancient ruins on Yath's farther shore, and though old
   lava-gatherers had warned him not to camp there at night, he tethered
   his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his
   blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none
   could decipher. Around him he wrapped another blanket, for the nights
   are cold in Oriab; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the
   wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether
   and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin
   groves.

   The sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal
   brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and
   pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of Yath, and Carter
   looked about for his tethered zebra. Great was his dismay to see that
   docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it
   had been tied, and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed
   was quite dead, with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound
   in its throat. His pack had been disturbed, and several shiny
   knickknacks taken away, and all round on the dusty soil' were great
   webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account. The
   legends and warnings of lava-gatherers occurred to him, and he thought
   of what had brushed his face in the night. Then he shouldered his pack
   and strode on toward Ngranek, though not without a shiver when he saw
   close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping
   arch low in the wall of an old temple, with steps leading down into
   darkness farther than he could peer.

   His course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country, and
   he saw only the huts of charcoal-burners and the camp of those who
   gathered resin from the groves. The whole air was fragrant with balsam,
   and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven
   colours in the sun. Near sunset he came on a new camp of lava-gatherers
   returning with laden sacks from Ngranek's lower slopes; and here he
   also camped, listening to the songs and tales of the men, and
   overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost. He had
   climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him, and at nightfall
   did not return to his fellows. When they looked for him the next day
   they found only his turban, nor was there any sign on the crags below
   that he had fallen. They did not search any more, because the old man
   among them said it would be of no use.

   No one ever found what the night-gaunts took, though those beasts
   themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous. Carter asked
   them if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left
   webbed footprints, but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed
   frightened at his making such an inquiry. When he saw how taciturn they
   had become he asked them no more, but went to sleep in his blanket.

   The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as
   they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them. Their
   older men gave him blessings and warnings, and told him he had better
   not climb too high on Ngranek, but while he thanked them heartily he
   was in no wise dissuaded. For still did he feel that he must find the
   gods on unknown Kadath; and win from them a way to that haunting and
   marvellous city in the sunset. By noon, after a long uphill ride, he
   came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-people who had once
   dwelt thus close to Ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava.
   Here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeeper's
   grandfather, but about that time they felt that their presence was
   disliked. Their homes had crept even up the mountain's slope, and the
   higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose. At
   last they decided it would be better to leave altogether, since things
   were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret
   favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in
   Baharna, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old
   art of image-making which to this day they carry on. It was from these
   children of the exiled hill-people that Carter had heard the best tales
   about Ngranek when searching through Baharna's ancient taverns.

   All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and
   higher as Carter approached it. There were sparse trees on the lower
   slopes and feeble shrubs above them, and then the bare hideous rock
   rose spectral into the sky, to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow.
   Carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone, and did
   not welcome the prospect of climbing it. In places there were solid
   streams of lava, and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges.
   Ninety aeons ago, before even the gods had danced upon its pointed
   peak, that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of
   the inner thunders. Now it towered all silent and sinister, bearing on
   the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told. And there
   were caves in that mountain, which might be empty and alone with elder
   darkness, or might--if legend spoke truly--hold horrors of a form not
   to be surmised.

   The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek, thinly covered with
   scrub oaks and ash trees, and strewn with bits of rock, lava, and
   ancient cinder. There were the charred embers of many camps, where the
   lava-gatherers were wont to stop, and several rude altars which they
   had built either to propitiate the Great Ones or to ward off what they
   dreamed of in Ngranek's high passes and labyrinthine caves. At evening
   Carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night,
   tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his
   blankets before going to sleep. And all through the night a voonith
   howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool, but Carter felt no
   fear of that amphibious terror, since he had been told with certainty
   that not one of them dares even approach the slope of Ngranek.

   In the clear sunshine of morning Carter began the long ascent, taking
   his zebra as far as that useful beast could go, but tying it to a
   stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep.
   Thereafter he scrambled up alone; first through the forest with its
   ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings, and then over the tough
   grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there. He regretted coming
   clear of the trees, since the slope was very precipitous and the whole
   thing rather dizzying. At length he began to discern all the
   countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked about; the
   deserted huts of the image-makers, the groves of resin trees and the
   camps of those who gathered from them, the woods where prismatic magahs
   nest and sing, and even a hint very far away of the shores of Yath and
   of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten. He found it
   best not to look around, and kept on climbing and climbing till the
   shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough
   grass to cling to.

   Then the soil became meagre, with great patches of bare rock cropping
   out, and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice. Finally there
   was nothing at all but the bare rock, and had it not been very rough
   and weathered, he could scarcely have ascended farther. Knobs, ledges,
   and pinnacles, however, helped greatly; and it was cheering to see
   occasionally the sign of some lava-gatherer scratched clumsily in the
   friable stone, and know that wholesome human creatures had been there
   before him. After a certain height the presence of man was further
   shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed, and by
   little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of
   lava had been found. In one place a narrow ledge had been chopped
   artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main
   line of ascent. Once or twice Carter dared to look around, and was
   almost stunned by the spread of landscape below. All the island betwixt
   him and the coast lay open to his sight, with Baharna's stone terraces
   and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance. And beyond that
   the illimitable Southern Sea with all its curious secrets.

   Thus far there had been much winding around the mountain, so that the
   farther and carven side was still hidden. Carter now saw a ledge
   running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished,
   and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous.
   After ten minutes he saw it was indeed no cul-de-sac, but that it led
   steeply on in an arc which would, unless suddenly interrupted or
   deflected, bring him after a few hours' climbing to that unknown
   southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley
   of lava. As new country came into view below him he saw that it was
   bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed. The
   mountain's side, too, was somewhat different; being here pierced by
   curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left.
   Some of these were above him and some beneath him, all opening on
   sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man.
   The air was very cold now, but so hard was the climbing that he did not
   mind it. Only the increasing rarity bothered him, and he thought that
   perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and
   excited those absurd tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the
   loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths. He was not
   much impressed by travellers' tales, but had a good curved scimitar in
   case of any trouble. All lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see
   that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop
   unknown Kadath.

   At last, in the fearsome iciness of upper space, he came round fully to
   the hidden side of Ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the
   lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of
   the Great Ones. There was unfolded, too, a vast expanse of country to
   the south; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage
   chimneys, and seemed to have no ending. No trace of the sea was visible
   on this side, for Oriab is a great island. Black caverns and odd
   crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs, but none of
   them was accessible to a climber. There now loomed aloft a great
   beetling mass which hampered the upward view, and Carter was for a
   moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable. Poised in windy
   insecurity miles above earth, with only space and death on one side and
   only slippery walls of rock on the other, he knew for a moment the fear
   that makes men shun Ngranek's hidden side. He could not turn round, yet
   the sun was already low. If there were no way aloft, the night would
   find him crouching there still, and the dawn would not find him at all.

   But there was a way, and he saw it in due season. Only a very expert
   dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds, yet to Carter
   they were sufficient. Surmounting now the outward-hanging rock, he
   found the slope above much easier than that below, since a great
   glacier's melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges. To
   the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown
   depths, with a cave's dark mouth just out of reach above him.
   Elsewhere, however, the mountain slanted back strongly, and even gave
   him space to lean and rest.

   He felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line, and looked
   up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy
   sunlight. Surely enough, there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet
   above, and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just
   climbed; hanging there forever in bold outline. And when he saw that
   crag he gasped and cried out aloud, and clutched at the jagged rock in
   awe; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth's dawn had shaped it,
   but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and
   polished features of a god.

   Stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire. How
   vast it was no mind can ever measure, but Carter knew at once that man
   could never have fashioned it. It was a god chiselled by the hands of
   the gods, and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker.
   Rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken, and Carter saw
   that it was indeed so; for those long narrow eyes and long-lobed ears,
   and that thin nose and pointed chin, all spoke of a race that is not of
   men but of gods.

   He clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie, even though it was
   this which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a god's
   face more of marvel than prediction can tell, and when that face is
   vaster than a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the
   scyptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was
   divinely hewn of old, the marvel is so strong that none may escape it.

   Here, too, was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had
   planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this
   face might mark them as the god's children, he now knew that he need
   not do so. Certainly, the great face carven on that mountain was of no
   strange sort, but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns
   of the seaport Celephais which lies in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian
   Hills and is ruled over by that King Kuranes whom Carter once knew in
   waking life. Every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships
   from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold
   and little red singing birds of Celephais, and it was clear that these
   could be no others than the half-gods he sought. Where they dwelt,
   there must the cold waste lie close, and within it unknown Kadath and
   its onyx castle for the Great Ones. So to Celephais he must go, far
   distant from the isle of Oriab, and in such parts as would take him
   back to Dylath-Teen and up the Skai to the bridge by Nir, and again
   into the enchanted wood of the Zoogs, whence the way would bend
   northward through the garden lands by Oukranos to the gilded spires of
   Thran, where he might find a galleon bound over the Cerenarian Sea.

   But dusk was now thick, and the great carven face looked down even
   sterner in shadow. Perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in
   the blackness he might neither go down nor go up, but only stand and
   cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came, praying to
   keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles
   of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley. The stars
   came out, but save for them there was only black nothingness in his
   eyes; nothingness leagued with death, against whose beckoning he might
   do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen
   brink. The last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor
   soaring close to the westward precipice beside him, and darting
   screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out
   of reach.

   Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt his curved
   scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he
   heard it clatter down over the rocks below. And between him and the
   Milky Way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something
   noxiously thin and horned and tailed and bat-winged. Other things, too,
   had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him, as if a flock of
   vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that
   inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice. Then a sort of cold
   rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he
   was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another minute
   and the stars were gone, and Carter knew that the night-gaunts had got
   him.

   They bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through
   monstrous labyrinths beyond. When he struggled, as at first he did by
   instinct, they tickled him with deliberation. They made no sound at all
   themselves, and even their membranous wings were silent. They were
   frightfully cold and damp and slippery, and their paws kneaded one
   detestably. Soon they were plunging hideously downward through
   inconceivable abysses in a whirling, giddying, sickening rush of dank,
   tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate
   vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness. He screamed again and again,
   but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater
   subtlety. Then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about, and guessed
   they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which
   dim legends tell, and which is litten only by the pale death-fire
   wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at
   earth's core.

   At last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles
   which he knew must be the fabled Peaks of Throk. Awful and sinister
   they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths; higher
   than man may reckon, and guarding terrible valleys where the Dholes
   crawl and burrow nastily. But Carter preferred to look at them than at
   his captors, which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with
   smooth, oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that curved inward
   toward each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly
   prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and
   disquietingly. And worst of all, they never spoke or laughed, and never
   smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with, but only a
   suggestive blankness where a face ought to be. All they ever did was
   clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way of night-gaunts.

   As the band flew lower the Peaks of Throk rose grey and towering on all
   sides, and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and
   impressive granite of the endless twilight. At still lower levels the
   death-fires in the air gave out, and one met only the primal blackness
   of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblin-like. Soon
   the peaks were very far away, and nothing about but great rushing winds
   with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them. Then in the end the
   night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers
   of bones, and left Carter all alone in that black valley. To bring him
   thither was the duty of the night-gaunts that guard Ngranek; and this
   done, they flapped away silently. When Carter tried to trace their
   flight he found he could not, since even the Peaks of Throk had faded
   out of sight. There was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and
   silence and bones.

   Now Carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of Pnoth,
   where crawl and burrow the enormous Dholes; but he did not know what to
   expect, because no one has ever seen a Dhole or even guessed what such
   a thing may be like. Dholes are known only by dim rumour, from the
   rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they
   have when they wriggle past one. They cannot be seen because they creep
   only in the dark. Carter did not wish to meet a Dhole, so listened
   intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him. Even
   in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective, for whispers of
   Pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old
   days. In brief, it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into
   which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their
   feastings; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that
   mighty crag taller even than Throk's peaks which marks the edge of
   their domain. Showers of bones would tell him where to look, and once
   found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder; for strange to
   say, he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures.

   A man he had known in Boston--a painter of strange pictures with a
   secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard--had
   actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand
   the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering. This man
   had vanished at last, and Carter was not sure but that he might find
   him now, and use for the first time in dreamland that far-away English
   of his dim waking life. In any case, he felt he could persuade a ghoul
   to guide him out of Pnoth; and it would be better to meet a ghoul,
   which one can see, than a Dhole, which one cannot see.

   So Carter walked in the dark, and ran when he thought he heard
   something among the bones underfoot. Once he bumped into a stony slope,
   and knew it must be the base of one of Throk's peaks. Then at last he
   heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air,
   and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls. He was not
   sure he could be heard from this valley miles below, but realised that
   the inner world has strange laws. As he pondered he was struck by a
   flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull, and therefore
   realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might
   that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul.

   Sound travels slowly, so it was some time before he heard an answering
   glibber. But it came at last, and before long he was told that a rope
   ladder would be lowered. The wait for this was very tense, since there
   was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by
   his shouting. Indeed, it was not long before he actually did hear a
   vague rustling afar off. As this thoughtfully approached, he became
   more and more uncomfortable; for he did not wish to move away from the
   spot where the ladder would come. Finally the tension grew almost
   unbearable, and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of
   something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the
   other sound. It was the ladder, and after a minute of groping he had it
   taut in his hands. But the other sound did not cease, and followed him
   even as he climbed. He had gone fully five feet from the ground when
   the rattling beneath waxed emphatic, and was a good ten feet up when
   something swayed the ladder from below. At a height which must have
   been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great
   slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with
   wriggling; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the
   unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed Dhole whose form no
   man might see.

   For hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands, seeing again the
   grey death-fire and Throk's uncomfortable pinnacles. At last he
   discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the
   ghouls, whose vertical side he could not glimpse; and hours later he
   saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet
   of Notre Dame. This almost made him lose his hold through faintness,
   but a moment later he was himself again; for his vanished friend
   Richard Pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul, and he knew well
   their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies.
   So he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him
   out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag, and did not
   scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the
   squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously.

   He was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were
   great boulders and the entrances of burrows. The ghouls were in general
   respectful, even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others
   eyed his leanness speculatively. Through patient glibbering he made
   inquiries regarding his vanished friend, and found he had become a
   ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world. A greenish
   elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to Pickman's present habitation,
   so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious
   burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould.
   They emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earth--old
   gravestones, broken urns, and grotesque fragments of monuments--and
   Carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the
   waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven
   hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber.

   There, on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the Granary Burying Ground in
   Boston, sat a ghoul which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman. It
   was naked and rubbery, and had acquired so much of the ghoulish
   physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure. But it still
   remembered a little English, and was able to converse with Carter in
   grunts and monosyllables, helped out now and then by the glibbering of
   ghouls. When it learned that Carter wished to get to the enchanted wood
   and from there to the city Celephais in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian
   Hills, it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the waking world
   do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving that to
   the red-footed wamps that are spawned in dead cities), and many things
   intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood, including the
   terrible kingdom of the Gugs.

   The Gugs, hairy and gigantic, once reared stone circles in that wood
   and made strange sacrifices to the Other Gods and the crawling chaos
   Nyarlathotep, until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears
   of earth's gods and they were banished to caverns below. Only a great
   trap door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the
   earth-ghouls with the enchanted wood, and this the Gugs are afraid to
   open because of a curse. That a mortal dreamer could traverse their
   cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable; for mortal
   dreamers were their former food, and they have legends of the
   toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted
   their diet to the ghasts, those repulsive beings which die in the
   light, and which live in the vaults of Zin and leap on long hind legs
   like kangaroos.

   So the ghoul that was Pickman advised Carter either to leave the abyss
   at Sarkomand, that deserted city in the valley below Leng where black
   nitrous stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from
   dreamland to the lower gulfs, or to return through a churchyard to the
   waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light
   slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the Gate
   of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted wood. This, however, did not suit
   the seeker; for he knew nothing of the way from Leng to Ooth-Nargai,
   and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far
   gained in this dream. It was disastrous to his quest to forget the
   august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded
   onyx in Celephais, and who, being the sons of gods, must point the way
   to the cold waste and Kadath where the Great Ones dwell.

   After much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the
   great wall of the Gugs' kingdom. There was one chance that Carter might
   be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers
   at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors, and
   reach the central tower with the sign of Koth upon it, which has the
   stairs leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood.
   Pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone
   lever in raising the stone door; for of ghouls the Gugs are somewhat
   afraid, and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when
   they see them feasting there.

   He also advised Carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the
   beard he had allowed to grow (for ghouls have none), wallowing naked in
   the mould to get the correct surface, and loping in the usual slumping
   way, with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice
   morsel from a tomb. They would reach the city of Gugs--which is
   coterminous with the whole kingdom--through the proper burrows,
   emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-containing Tower of Koth.
   They must beware, however, of a large cave near the cemetery; for this
   is the mouth of the vaults of Zin, and the vindictive ghasts are always
   on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who
   hunt and prey on them. The ghasts try to come out when the Gugs sleep
   and they attack ghouls as readily as Gugs, for they cannot
   discriminate. They are very primitive, and eat one another. The Gugs
   have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of Zin, but he is often drowsy
   and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts. Though ghasts cannot
   live in real light, they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for
   hours.

   So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful
   ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of Col. Nepemiah Derby, obit 1719,
   from the Charter Street Burying Ground in Salem. When they came again
   into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths
   reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest
   gravestones of the Gugs. On the right of the hole out of which they
   wriggled, and seen through aisles of monoliths, was a stupendous vista
   of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of
   inner earth. This was the great city of the Gugs, whose doorways are
   thirty feet high. Ghouls come here often, for a buried Gug will feed a
   community for almost a year, and even with the added peril it is better
   to burrow for Gugs than to bother with the graves of men. Carter now
   understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the
   vale of Pnoth.

   Straight ahead, and just outside the cemetery, rose a sheer
   perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern
   yawned. This the ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as possible, since
   it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where Gugs hunt
   ghasts in the darkness. And truly, that warning was soon well
   justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to
   see if the hour of the Gugs' resting had been rightly timed, there
   glowed in the gloom of that great cavern's mouth first one pair of
   yellowish-red eyes and then another, implying that the Gugs were one
   sentry less, and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of
   smell. So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions
   to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices, and
   there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw, since they must
   naturally be rather tired after coping with a Gug sentry in the black
   vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped
   out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of
   that scabrous and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human
   despite the absence of a nose, a forehead, and other important
   particulars.

   Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow, and a
   ghoul glibbered softly at Carter that their absence of battle-scars was
   a bad sign. It proved that they had not fought the Gug sentry at all,
   but had merely slipped past him as he slept, so that their strength and
   savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found
   and disposed of a victim. It was very unpleasant to see those filthy
   and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen, grubbing
   about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan
   towers and monoliths arose, but it was still more unpleasant when they
   spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts. And yet,
   horrible as they were, they were not so horrible as what presently came
   out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness.

   It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with
   formidable talons. Alter it came another paw, and after that a great
   black-furred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short
   forearms. Then two pink eyes shone, and the head of the awakened Gug
   sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled into view. The eyes jutted two
   inches from each side, shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with
   coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth.
   That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of
   the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally.

   But before that unfortunate Gug could emerge from the cave and rise to
   his full twenty feet, the vindictive ghasts were upon him. Carter
   feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin,
   till a ghoul softly glibbered that Gugs have no voice but talk by means
   of facial expression. The battle which then ensued was truly a
   frightful one. From all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at
   the creeping Gug, nipping and tearing with their muzzles, and mauling
   murderously with their hard pointed hooves. All the time they coughed
   excitedly, screaming when the great vertical mouth of the Gug would
   occasionally bite into one of their number, so that the noise of the
   combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the
   weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and
   farther within the cavern. As it was, the tumult soon receded
   altogether from sight in the blackness, with only occasional evil
   echoes to mark its continuance.

   Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance,
   and Carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and
   into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers
   of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight. Silently they shambled
   over that rough rock pavement, hearing with disgust the abominable
   muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of
   the Gugs. Apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour, the ghouls set a
   somewhat rapid pace; but even so the journey was no brief one, for
   distances in that town of giants are on a great scale. At last,
   however, they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster
   than the rest; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous
   symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder without knowing its
   meaning. This was the central tower with the sign of Koth, and those
   huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the
   beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the
   enchanted wood.

   There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness: made
   almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were
   fashioned for Gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their
   number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn
   out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All
   through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and
   pursuit; for though no Gug dares lift the stone door to the forest
   because of the Great One's curse, there are no such restraints
   concerning the tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often
   chased, even to the very top. So sharp are the ears of Gugs, that the
   bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the
   city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the
   striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin
   to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on
   those cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the
   silent pursuing Gugs would not be heard at all, but would come very
   suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers. Nor could the
   traditional fear of Gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar
   place where the advantages lay so heavily with the Gugs. There was also
   some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently
   hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the Gugs. If the Gugs
   slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern,
   the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome
   and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be
   eaten by a Gug.

   Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness
   above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn.

   It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that
   tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally
   clear that this peril was very close. Alter a breathless second the
   leading ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the
   best possible way, with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing
   blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the
   dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been
   alone. In another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward
   hopping of at least one beast, and the slab-bearing ghouls poised their
   weapon for a desperate blow. Presently two yellowish-red eyes flashed
   into view, and the panting of the ghast became audible above its
   clattering. As it hopped down to the step above the ghouls, they
   wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force, so that there was
   only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious
   heap. There seemed to be only this one animal, and after a moment of
   listening the ghouls tapped Carter as a signal to proceed again. As
   before, they were obliged to aid him; and he was glad to leave that
   place of carnage where the ghast's uncouth remains sprawled invisible
   in the blackness.

   At last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above
   him, Carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at
   last. To open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of, but
   the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under
   as a prop, and permit Carter to escape through the crack. They
   themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the
   Gugs, since their elusiveness was great, and they did not know the way
   overland to spectral Sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the abyss.

   Mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door
   above them, and Carter helped push with as much strength as he had.
   They judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one,
   and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished
   muscles. Alter a few moments a crack of light appeared; and Carter, to
   whom that task had been entrusted, slipped the end of the old
   gravestone in the aperture. There now ensued a mighty heaving; but
   progress was very slow, and they had of course to return to their first
   position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal
   open.

   Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on
   the steps below them. It was only the thumping and rattling of the
   slain ghast's hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all
   the possible causes of that body's dislodgement and rolling, none was
   in the least reassuring. Therefore, knowing the ways of Gugs, the
   ghouls set to with something of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short
   time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst
   Carter turned the slab and left a generous opening. They now helped
   Carter through, letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and
   later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper
   dreamland outside. Another second and they were through themselves,
   knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap door while a
   panting became audible beneath. Because of the Great One's curse no Gug
   might ever emerge from that portal, so with a deep relief and sense of
   repose Carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted
   wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest.

   Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long
   ago, it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now
   left behind. There was no living denizen about, for Zoogs shun the
   mysterious door in fear and Carter at once consulted with his ghouls
   about their future course. To return through the tower they no longer
   dared, and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned
   that they must pass the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of
   flame. So at length they decided to return through Sarkomand and its
   gate of the abyss, though of how to get there they knew nothing. Carter
   recalled that it lies in the valley below Leng, and recalled likewise
   that he had seen in Dylath-Leen a sinister, slant-eyed old merchant
   reputed to trade on Leng, therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out
   Dylath-Leen, crossing the fields to Nir and the Skai and following the
   river to its mouth. This they at once resolved to do, and lost no time
   in loping off, since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night
   ahead for travel. And Carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts,
   thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast
   which once was Pickman; but could not help sighing with pleasure when
   they left. For a ghoul is a ghoul, and at best an unpleasant companion
   for man. After that Carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of
   the mud of nether earth, thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so
   carefully carried.

   It was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees, but
   because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day;
   wherefore Carter set out upon the well-known route toward Celephais, in
   Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills. And as he went he thought of the
   zebra he had left tethered to an ash-tree on Ngranek in far-away Oriab
   so many aeons ago, and wondered if any lava-gatherers had fed and
   released it. And he wondered, too, if he would ever return to Baharna
   and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by
   Yath's shore, and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him. Such were
   the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper
   dreamland.

   But presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large
   hollow tree. He had avoided the great circle of stones, since he did
   not care to speak with Zoogs just now; but it appeared from the
   singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in
   session elsewhere. Upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a
   tense and heated discussion; and before long became conscious of
   matters which he viewed with the greatest concern. For a war on the
   cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of Zoogs. It all came
   from the loss of the party which had sneaked after Carter to Ulthar,
   and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions. The
   matter had long rankled; and now, or at least within a month, the
   marshalled Zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a
   series of surprise attacks, taking individual cats or groups of cats
   unawares, and giving not even the myriad cats of Ulthar a proper chance
   to drill and mobilise. This was the plan of the Zoogs, and Carter saw
   that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest.

   Very quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the
   wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields. And a great
   grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across
   leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small, black, grey,
   tiger, white, yellow, and mixed, and it echoed through Nir and beyond
   the Skai even into Ulthar, and Ulthar's numerous cats called in chorus
   and fell into a line of march. It was fortunate that the moon was not
   up, so that all the cats were on earth. Swiftly and silently leaping,
   they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry
   sea across the plains to the edge of the wood. Carter was there to
   greet them, and the sight of shapely, wholesome cats was indeed good
   for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss.
   He was glad to see his venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the
   head of Ulthar's detachment, a collar of rank around his sleek neck,
   and whiskers bristling at a martial angle. Better still, as a
   sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be
   none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom Carter had
   given a saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in Ulthar.
   He was a strapping and promising cat now, and purred as he shook hands
   with his friend. His grandfather said he was doing very well in the
   army, and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more
   campaign.

   Carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe, and was rewarded by
   deep-throated purrs of gratitude from all sides. Consulting with the
   generals, he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching
   at once upon the Zoog council and other known strongholds of Zoogs;
   forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before
   the mobilization of their army of invasion. Thereupon without a
   moment's loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and
   surged around the council tree and the great stone circle. Flutterings
   rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very
   little resistance among the furtive and curious brown Zoogs. They saw
   that they were beaten in advance, and turned from thoughts of vengeance
   to thoughts of present self-preservation.

   Half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the
   captured Zoogs in the centre, leaving open a lane down which were
   marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other
   parts of the wood. Terms were discussed at length, Carter acting as
   interpreter, and it was decided that the Zoogs might remain a free
   tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse,
   quail, and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the forest. Twelve
   young Zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the
   Temple of Cats at Ulthar, and the victors made it plain that any
   disappearances of cats on the borders of the Zoog domain would be
   followed by consequences highly disastrous to Zoogs. These matters
   disposed of, the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the Zoogs to
   slink off one by one to their respective homes, which they hastened to
   do with many a sullen backward glance.

   The old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to
   whatever border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the Zoogs
   would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their
   warlike enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for
   the safety it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship
   of cats. So in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed
   after the successful performance of its duty, Randolph Carter walked
   with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan
   trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson
   whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased
   fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of that primeval
   floor. And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in
   the cold waste, but did not know where it was. As for the marvellous
   sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but would gladly relay to
   Carter anything he might later learn.

   He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of
   dreamland, and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in
   Celephais, whither he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known
   to Carter, was a dignified maltese; and would prove highly influential
   in any transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of
   the wood, and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young
   sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had
   not the old general forbidden it, but that austere patriarch insisted
   that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set
   out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a
   willow-fringed river, and the cats went back into the wood.

   Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the
   wood of the Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing
   river Oukianos that marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle
   slopes of grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand
   flowers that starred each knoll and dangle. A blessed haze lies upon
   all this region, wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than
   other places hold, and a little more of the summer's humming music of
   birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place,
   and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember.

   By noon Carter reached the jasper terraces of Kiran which slope down to
   the river's edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the King of
   Ilek-Vad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a
   golden palanquin to pray to the god of Oukianos, who sang to him in
   youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks. All of jasper is that
   temple, and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts, its
   seven pinnacled towers, and its inner shrine where the river enters
   through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night. Many
   times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and
   terraces and pinnacles, but whether that music be the song of the god
   or the chant of the cryptical priests, none but the King of Ilek-Vad
   may say; for only he had entered the temple or seen the priests. Now,
   in the drowsiness of day, that carven and delicate fane was silent, and
   Carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the
   birds and bees as he walked onward under the enchanted sun.

   All that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and
   in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages
   and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl.
   Sometimes he walked close to the bank of Oukianos and whistled to the
   sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream, and at other
   times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great
   dark wood on the farther side, whose trees came down clear to the
   water's edge. In former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths
   come shyly out of that wood to drink, but now he could not glimpse any.
   Once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing
   bird, which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the
   sun, and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged
   hunter sought to dart down upon it.

   Toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming
   in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of Thran. Lofty beyond belief
   are the alabaster walls of that incredible city, sloping inward toward
   the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows, for
   they are more ancient than memory. Yet lofty as they are with their
   hundred gates and two hundred turrets, the clustered towers within, all
   white beneath their golden spires, are loftier still; so that men on
   the plain around see them soaring into the sky, sometimes shining
   clear, sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist, and
   sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free
   above the vapours. And where Thran's gates open on the river are great
   wharves of marble, with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and
   calamander riding gently at anchor, and strange bearded sailors sitting
   on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places. Landward beyond
   the walls lies the farm country, where small white cottages dream
   between little hills, and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind
   gracefully among streams and gardens.

   Down through this verdant land Carter walked at evening, and saw
   twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of
   Thran. And just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate, and
   was stopped by a red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond
   belief, and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up Thran's steep
   mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars where the wares of the
   ornate galleons were sold. Then into that incredible city he walked;
   through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel, and thereafter
   amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the
   heavenward towers. Lights shone through grated and balconied windows,
   and,the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where
   marble fountains bubbled. Carter knew his way, and edged down through
   darker streets to the river, where at an old sea tavern he found the
   captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams. There he
   bought his passage to Celephais on a great green galleon, and there he
   stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of
   that inn, who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of
   old wars and forgotten gods.

   In the morning Carter boarded the galleon bound for Celephais, and sat
   in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the
   Cerenerian Sea begun. For many leagues the banks were much as they were
   above Thran, with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther
   hills toward the right, and a drowsy village on the shore, with steep
   red roofs and nets spread in the sun. Mindful of his search, Carter
   questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in
   the taverns of Celephais, asking the names and ways of the strange men
   with long, narrow eyes, long-lobed ears, thin noses, and pointed chins
   who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved
   jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of Celephais. Of these
   men the sailors knew not much, save that they talked but seldom and
   spread a kind of awe about them.

   Their land, very far away, was called Inquanok, and not many people
   cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land, and said to be
   close to unpleasant Leng; although high impassable mountains towered on
   the side where Leng was thought to lie, so that none might say whether
   this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable
   monastery were really there, or whether the rumour were only a fear
   that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks
   loomed black against a rising moon. Certainly, men reached Leng from
   very different oceans. Of other boundaries of Inquanok those sailors
   had no notion, nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath
   save from vague unplaced report. And of the marvellous sunset city
   which Carter sought they knew nothing at all. So the traveller asked no
   more of far things, but bided his time till he might talk with those
   strange men from cold and twilight Inquanok who are the seed of such
   gods as carved their features on Ngranek.

   Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which
   traverse the perfumed jungles of Kied. Here Carter wished he might
   disembark, for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory,
   lone and unbroken, where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose
   name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed
   and undecayed, for it is written that there may one day be need of them
   again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight,
   though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to
   which their wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and dusk hushed
   the hum of the day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the
   early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving
   only its fragrance as a memory that it had been. And all through the
   night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected.
   Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east, but the sleepy
   captain said they had better not be looked at too much, since it was
   highly uncertain just who or what had lit them.

   In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by
   the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading
   city of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged
   granite, and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered
   gables. The men of Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than
   any others in dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for
   barter, but is prized for the solid work of its artisans. The wharves
   of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the
   captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked
   curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and
   feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea
   taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the
   spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low
   black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull's-eye panes.
   Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports, and told
   many stories of the curious men from twilight Inquanok, but had little
   to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then at last, after
   much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset
   sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last
   golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men
   had given them.

   Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea,
   sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of
   the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its
   gingko-trees swaying on the lower slope, and Carter knew that they were
   come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celephais.
   Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous
   town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and
   the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the gentle
   hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and
   the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the
   purple ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay
   forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream.

   The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the
   marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond
   where the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more
   substantial parts of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his
   way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in
   the dusk as the city's million lights began to twinkle out over the
   water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for here time has
   no power to tarnish or destroy. As it has always been is still the
   turquoise of Nath-Horthath, and the eighty orchid-wreathed priests are
   the same who builded it ten thousand years ago. Shining still is the
   bronze of the great gates, nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or
   broken. And the great bronze statues on the walls look down on
   merchants and camel drivers older than fable, yet without one grey hair
   in their forked beards.

   Carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel,
   but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors. And when it
   was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he
   knew well, and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown Kadath whom he
   sought. The next day he searched all along the quays for some of the
   strange mariners of Inquanok, but was told that none were now in port,
   their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks. He found,
   however, one Thorabonian sailor who had been to Inquanok and had worked
   in the onyx quarries of that twilight place; and this sailor said there
   was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region, which
   everybody seemed to fear and shun. The Thorabonian opined that this
   desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into Leng's
   horrible plateau, and that this was why men feared it; though he
   admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless
   sentinels. Whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein
   unknown Kadath stands he did not know; but it seemed unlikely that
   those presences and sentinels, if indeed they existed, were stationed
   for nought.

   On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to the
   turquoise temple and talked with the High-Priest. Though Nath-Horthath
   is chiefly worshipped in Celephais, all the Great Ones are mentioned in
   diurnal prayers; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods.
   Like Atal in distant Ulthar, he strongly advised against any attempts
   to see them; declaring that they are testy and capricious, and subject
   to strange protection from the mindless Other Gods from Outside, whose
   soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Their jealous
   hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not
   wish Carter to reach it, and it was doubtful how they would regard a
   guest whose object was to see them and plead before them. No man had
   ever found Kadath in the past, and it might be just as well if none
   ever found it in the future. Such rumours as were told about that onyx
   castle of the Great Ones were not by any means reassuring.

   Having thanked the orchid-crowned High-Priest, Carter left the temple
   and sought out the bazaar of the sheep-butchers, where the old chief of
   Celephais' cats dwelt sleek and contented. That grey and dignified
   being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement, and extended a languid
   paw as his caller approached. But when Carter repeated the passwords
   and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of Ulthar, the
   furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative; and told much of
   the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of Ooth-Nargai.
   Best of all, he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid
   waterfront cats of Celephais about the men of Inquanok, on whose dark
   ships no cat will go.

   It seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them, though
   that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships. The reason
   for this is that Inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure, so
   that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or
   a homely mew. Whether it be because of things wafted over the
   impassable peaks from hypothetical Leng, or because of things filtering
   down from the chilly desert to the north, none may say; but it remains
   a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which
   cats do not like, and to which they are more sensitive than men.
   Therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays
   of Inquanok.

   The old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend King
   Kuranes, who in Carter's latter dreams had reigned alternately in the
   rose-crystal Palace of the Seventy Delights at Celephais and in the
   turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating Serannian. It seemed that he
   could no more find content in those places, but had formed a mighty
   longing for the English cliffs and downlands of his boyhood; where in
   little dreaming villages England's old songs hover at evening behind
   lattice windows, and where grey church towers peep lovely through the
   verdure of distant valleys. He could not go back to these things in the
   waking world because his body was dead; but he had done the next best
   thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east
   of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the sea-cliffs to the
   foot of the Tanarian Hills. There he dwelt in a grey Gothic manor-house
   of stone looking on the sea, and tried to think it was ancient Trevor
   Towers, where he was born and where thirteen generations of his
   forefathers had first seen the light. And on the coast nearby he had
   built a little Cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways,
   settling therein such people as had the most English faces, and seeking
   ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old Cornwall fishers.
   And in a valley not far off he had reared a great Norman Abbey whose
   tower he could see from his window, placing around it in the churchyard
   grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon, and with a
   moss somewhat like Old England's moss. For though Kuranes was a monarch
   in the land of dream, with all imagined pomps and marvels, splendours
   and beauties, ecstasies and delights, novelties and excitements at his
   command, he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power
   and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure
   and quiet England, that ancient, beloved England which had moulded his
   being and of which he must always be immutably a part.

   So when Carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu, he did not
   seek the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern
   gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he
   glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the sea-cliffs. And
   in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge,
   and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and
   annointed lackey of the palace, but a small stubby old man in a smock
   who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far Cornwall. And
   Carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to
   England's trees, and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in
   Queen Anne's time. At the door, flanked by stone cats in the old way,
   he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery; and was presently
   taken to the library where Kuranes, Lord of Ooth-Nargai and the Sky
   around Serannian, sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his
   little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in
   and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawn-party at
   the vicar's, with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of
   patience.

   Kuranes, clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by London tailors
   in his youth, rose eagerly to meet his guest; for the sight of an
   Anglo-Saxon from the waking world was very dear to him, even if it was
   a Saxon from Boston, Massachusetts, instead of from Cornwall. And for
   long they talked of old times, having much to say because both were old
   dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places. Kuranes,
   indeed, had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void, and was
   said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyage.

   At length Carter brought up the subject of his quest, and asked of his
   host those questions he had asked of so many others. Kuranes did not
   know where Kadath was, or the marvellous sunset city; but he did know
   that the Great Ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out, and that
   the Other Gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent
   curiosity. He had learned much of the Other Gods in distant parts of
   space, especially in that region where form does not exist, and
   coloured gases study the innermost secrets. The violet gas S'ngac had
   told him terrible things of the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, and had
   warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan
   Azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark.

   Altogether, it was not well to meddle with the Elder Ones; and if they
   persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city, it were
   better not to seek that city.

   Kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by
   coming to the city even were he to gain it. He himself had dreamed and
   yearned long years for lovely Celephais and the land of Ooth-Nargai,
   and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of
   its chains, and conventions, and stupidities. But now that he was come
   into that city and that land, and was the king thereof, he found the
   freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out, and monotonous for
   want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories. He was
   a king in Ooth-Nargai, but found no meaning therein, and drooped always
   for the old familiar things of England that had shaped his youth. All
   his kingdom would he give for the sound of Cornish church bells over
   the downs, and all the thousand minarets of Celephais for the steep
   homely roofs of the village near his home. So he told his guest that
   the unknown sunset city might not hold quite that content he sought,
   and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and half-remembered
   dream. For he had visited Carter often in the old waking days, and knew
   well the lovely New England slopes that had given him birth.

   At the last, he was very certain, the seeker would long only for the
   early remembered scenes; the glow of Beacon Hill at evening, the tall
   steeples and winding hill streets of quaint Kingsport, the hoary
   gambrel roofs of ancient and witch-haunted Arkham, and the blessed
   meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables
   peeped out from bowers of verdure. These things he told Randolph
   Carter, but still the seeker held to his purpose. And in the end they
   parted each with his own conviction, and Carter went back through the
   bronze gate into Celephais and down the Street of Pillars to the old
   sea wall, where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and
   waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight Inquanok, whose
   strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders had in them the blood of the
   Great Ones.

   One starlit evening when the Pharos shone splendid over the harbour the
   longed-for ship put in, and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared
   one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea
   wall. It was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the
   godlike features of Ngranek, but Carter did not hasten to speak with
   the silent seamen. He did not know how much of pride and secrecy and
   dim supernal memory might fill those children of the Great Ones, and
   was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too
   closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land.
   They talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns;
   but would gather in groups in remote comers and sing among themselves
   the haunting airs of unknown places, or chant long tales to one another
   in accents alien to the rest of dreamland. And so rare and moving were
   those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces
   of those who listened, even though the words came to common ears only
   as strange cadence and obscure melody.

   For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the
   bazaars of Celephais, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage
   on their dark ship, telling them that he was an old onyx miner and
   wishful to work in their quarries. That ship was very lovey and
   cunningly wrought, being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries
   of gold, and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of
   silk and velvet. One morning at the turn of the tide the sails were
   raised and the anchor lilted, and as Carter stood on the high stern he
   saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of
   ageless Celephais sink into the distance, and the snowy peak of Mount
   Man grow smaller and smaller. By noon there was nothing in sight save
   the gentle blue of the Cerenerian Sea, with one painted galley afar off
   bound for that realm of Serannian where the sea meets the sky.

   And the night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for
   Charles' Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole.
   And the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places, and they stole
   off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured
   old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish
   playing in bowers beneath the sea. Carter went to sleep at midnight,
   and rose in the glow of a young morning, marking that the sun seemed
   farther south than was its wont. And all through that second day he
   made progress in knowing the men of the ship, getting them little by
   little to talk of their cold twilight land, of their exquisite onyx
   city, and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which
   Leng was said to be. They told him how sorry they were that no cats
   would stay in the land of Inquanok, and how they thought the hidden
   nearness of Leng was to blame for it. Only of the stony desert to the
   north they would not talk. There was something disquieting about that
   desert, and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence.

   On later days they talked of the quarries in which Carter said he was
   going to work. There were many of them, for all the city of Inquanok
   was builded of onyx, whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in
   Rinar, Ogrothan, and Celephais and at home with the merchants of Thraa,
   Flarnek, and Kadatheron, for the beautiful wares of those fabulous
   ports. And far to the north, almost in the cold desert whose existence
   the men of Inquanok did not care to admit, there was an unused quarry
   greater than all the rest; from which had been hewn in forgotten times
   such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled
   vacancies struck terror to all who beheld. Who had mined those
   incredible blocks, and whither they had been transported, no man might
   say; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry, around which
   such inhuman memories might conceivably cling. So it was left all alone
   in the twilight, with only the raven and the rumoured Shantak-bird to
   brood on its immensities. When Carter heard of this quarry he was moved
   to deep thought, for he knew from old tales that the Great Ones' castle
   atop unknown Kadath is of onyx.

   Each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky, and the mists
   overhead grew thicker and thicker. And in two weeks there was not any
   sunlight at all, but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome
   of eternal cloud by day, and a cold starless phosphorescence from the
   under side of that cloud by night. On the twentieth day a great jagged
   rock in the sea was sighted from afar, the first land glimpsed since
   Man's snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship. Carter asked the captain
   the name of that rock, but was told that it had no name and had never
   been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at
   night. And when, after dark, a dull and ceaseless howling arose from
   that jagged granite place, the traveller was glad that no stop had been
   made, and that the rock had no name. The seamen prayed and chanted till
   the noise was out of earshot, and Carter dreamed terrible dreams within
   dreams in the small hours.

   Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line
   of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of
   that twilight world. And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad
   songs, and some knelt down on the deck to pray, so that Carter knew
   they were come to the land of Inquanok and would soon be moored to the
   basalt quays of the great town bearing that land's name. Toward noon a
   dark coastline appeared, and before three o'clock there stood out
   against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx
   city. Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and
   quays, all of delicate black with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of
   inlaid gold. Tall and many-windowed were the houses, and carved on
   every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the
   eye with a beauty more poignant than light. Some ended in swelling
   domes that tapered to a point, others in terraced pyramids whereon rose
   clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and
   imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates, each
   under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by
   the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the
   monstrous face on distant Ngranek. On a hill in the centre rose a
   sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high
   pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, the seamen said,
   was the Temple of the Elder Ones, and was ruled by an old High-Priest
   sad with inner secrets.

   At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city,
   answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns, viols,
   and chanting voices. And from a row of tripods on a galley round the
   high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments;
   for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal
   mysteries, and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the Great Ones as set
   forth in scrolls older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As the ship rode
   past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of
   the city grew manifest, and Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and
   merchants on the docks. The sailors and merchants were of the
   strange-faced race of the gods, but the slaves were squat, slant-eyed
   folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the
   impassable peaks from the valleys beyond Leng. The wharves reached wide
   outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from
   the galleys anchored there, while at one end were great piles of onyx
   both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of Rinar,
   Ograthan and Celephais.

   It was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting
   quay of stone, and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through
   the arched gate into the city. The streets of that city were paved with
   onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked
   and narrow. The houses near the water were lower than the rest, and
   bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said
   to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each. The
   captain of the ship took Carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the
   mariners of quaint countries, and promised that he would next day shew
   him the wonders of the twilight city, and lead him to the taverns of
   the onyx-miners by the northern wall. And evening fell, and little
   bronze lamps were lighted, and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of
   remote places. But when from its high tower the great bell shivered
   over the city, and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose
   cryptical in answer thereto, all ceased their songs or tales and bowed
   silent till the last echo died away. For there is a wonder and a
   strangeness on the twilight city of Inquanok, and men fear to be lax in
   its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close.

   Far in the shadows of that tavern Carter saw a squat form he did not
   like, for it was unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he
   had seen so long before in the taverns of Dylath-Leen, who was reputed
   to trade with the horrible stone villages of Leng which no healthy folk
   visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar, and even to
   have dealt with that High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears a
   yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric
   stone monastery. This man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing
   when Carter asked the traders of Dylath-Leen about the cold waste and
   Kadath; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted Inquanok, so close
   to the wonders of the north, was not a reassuring thing. He slipped
   wholly out of sight before Carter could speak to him, and sailors later
   said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well
   determined, bearing the colossal and rich-flavoured eggs of the
   rumoured Shantak-bird to trade for the dextrous jade goblets that
   merchants brought from Ilarnek.

   On the following morning the ship-captain led Carter through the onyx
   streets of Inquanok, dark under their twilight sky. The inlaid doors
   and figured house-fronts, carven balconies and crystal-paned oriels all
   gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness; and now and then a plaza
   would open out with black pillars, colonnades, and the statues of
   curious beings both human and fabulous. Some of the vistas down long
   and unbending streets, or through side alleys and over bulbous domes,
   spires, and arabesqued roofs, were weird and beautiful beyond words;
   and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great
   central Temple of the Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides, its
   flattened dome, and its lofty pinnacled belfry, overtopping all else,
   and majestic whatever its foreground. And always to the east, far
   beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land, rose the gaunt
   grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous
   Leng was said to lie.

   The captain took Carter to the mighty temple, which is set with its
   walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes
   from a wheel's hub. The seven arched gates of that garden, each having
   over it a carven face like those on the city's gates, are always open,
   and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through
   the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest
   gods. And there are fountains, pools, and basins there to reflect the
   frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony, all of onyx and
   having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower
   bowers of ocean. When the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers
   over the garden and the city, and the answer of the horns and viols and
   voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates, there issue
   from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded
   priests in black, bearing at arm's length before them great golden
   bowls from which a curious steam rises. And all the seven columns strut
   peculiarly in single file, legs thrown far forward without bending the
   knees, down the walks that lead to the seven lodges, wherein they
   disappear and do not appear again. It is said that subterrene paths
   connect the lodges with the temple, and that the long files of priests
   return through them; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx
   steps go down to mysteries that are never told. But only a few are
   those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are
   not human beings.

   Carter did not enter the temple, because none but the Veiled King is
   permitted to do that. But before he left the garden the hour of the
   bell came, and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him, and
   the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by
   the gates. And down the seven great walks stalked the long files of
   bowl-bearing priests in their singular way, giving to the traveller a
   fear which human priests do not often give. When the last of them had
   vanished he left that garden, noting as he did so a spot on the
   pavement over which the bowls had passed. Even the ship-captain did not
   like that spot, and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the Veiled
   King's palace rises many-domed and marvellous.

   The ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow, all but the broad
   curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in
   yak-drawn chariots. Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was
   all steps, between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold, and
   under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of
   music or breaths of exotic fragrance. Always ahead loomed those titan
   walls, mighty buttresses, and clustered and bulbous domes for which the
   Veiled King's palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great
   black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch's pleasure. There
   Carter paused in faintness at so much beauty, for the onyx terraces and
   colonnaded walks, the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees
   espaliered to golden lattices, the brazen urns and tripods with cunning
   bas-reliefs, the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined
   black marble, the basalt-bottomed lagoon's tiled fountains with
   luminous fish, the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven
   columns, the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates, and the
   blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all
   joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality, and
   half-fabulous even in the land of dreams. There it shimmered like a
   vision under that grey twilight sky, with the domed and fretted
   magnificence of the palace ahead, and the fantastic silhouette of the
   distant impassable peaks on the right. And ever the small birds and the
   fountains sang, while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil
   over that incredible garden. No other human presence was there, and
   Carter was glad it was so. Then they turned and descended again the
   onyx alley of steps, for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it
   is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome,
   since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured
   Shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious.

   After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town,
   near the Gate of the Caravans, where are the taverns of the
   yak-merchants and the onyx-miners. And there, in a low-ceiled inn of
   quarrymen, they said farewell; for business called the captain whilst
   Carter was eager to talk with miners about the north. There were many
   men in that inn, and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of
   them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx, and anxious to know
   somewhat of Inquanok's quarries. But all that he learned was not much
   more than he knew before, for the miners were timid and evasive about
   the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits. They
   had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where Leng is
   said to lie, and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north
   among the scattered rocks. And they whispered also that the rumoured
   Shantak-birds are no wholesome things; it being indeed for the best
   that no man has ever truly seen one (for that fabled father of Shantaks
   in the king's dome is fed in the dark).

   The next day, saying that he wished to look over all the various mines
   for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages
   of Inquanok, Carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddle-bags
   for a journey. Beyond the Gate of the Caravans the road lay straight
   betwixt tilled fields, with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes.
   At some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions; once
   finding a host so austere and reticent, and so full of an unplaced
   majesty like to that in the huge features on Ngranek, that he felt
   certain he had come at last upon one of the Great Ones themselves, or
   upon one with full nine-tenths of their blood, dwelling amongst men.
   And to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very
   well of the gods, and to praise all the blessings they had ever
   accorded him.

   That night Carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great
   lygath-tree to which he tied his yak, and in the morning resumed his
   northward pilgrimage. At about ten o'clock he reached the small-domed
   village of Urg, where traders rest and miners tell their tales, and
   paused in its taverns till noon. It is here that the great caravan road
   turns west toward Selarn, but Carter kept on north by the quarry road.
   All the afternoon he followed that rising road, which was somewhat
   narrower than the great highway, and which now led through a region
   with more rocks than tilled fields. And by evening the low hills on his
   left had risen into sizable black cliffs, so that he knew he was close
   to the mining country. All the while the great gaunt sides of the
   impassable mountains towered afar off at his right, and the farther he
   went, the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and
   traders and drivers of lumbering onyx-carts along the way.

   On the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag,
   tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground. He observed the
   greater phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point, and more
   than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them. And on the
   third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry, and greeted
   the men who there laboured with picks and chisels. Before evening he
   had passed eleven quarries; the land being here given over altogether
   to onyx cliffs and boulders, with no vegetation at all, but only great
   rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth, with the grey
   impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right. The
   third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires
   cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west. And they
   sang many songs and told many tales, shewing such strange knowledge of
   the olden days and the habits of gods that Carter could see they held
   many latent memories of their sires the Great Ones. They asked him
   whither he went, and cautioned him not to go too far to the north; but
   he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx, and would take no
   more risks than were common among prospectors. In the morning he bade
   them adieu and rode on into the darkening north, where they had warned
   him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older
   than men's hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did not like it
   when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw
   approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting
   eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng was the gossip of distant
   Dylath-Leen.

   After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inquanok seemed to end,
   and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding
   black cliffs. Always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks,
   and as Carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm
   he found it grew darker and colder. Soon he perceived that there were
   no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath, and realised
   that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time.
   Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead, and now and then a
   flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of
   the rumoured Shantak-bird. But in the main he was alone with his shaggy
   steed, and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became
   more and more reluctant to advance, and more and more disposed to snort
   affrightedly at any small noise along the route.

   The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls, and began
   to display an even greater steepness than before. It was a bad footing,
   and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about.
   In two hours Carter saw ahead a definite crest, beyond which was
   nothing but dull grey sky, and blessed the prospect of a level or
   downward course. To reach this crest, however, was no easy task; for
   the way had grown nearly perpendicular, and was perilous with loose
   black gravel and small stones. Eventually Carter dismounted and led his
   dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled, and
   keeping his own footing as best he might. Then suddenly he came to the
   top and saw beyond, and gasped at what he saw.

   The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down, with the same
   lines of high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there
   opened out a monstrous space, vast acres in extent, where some archaic
   power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a
   giant's quarry. Far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean
   gouge, and deep down within earth's bowels its lower delvings yawned.
   It was no quarry of man, and the concave sides were scarred with great
   squares, yards wide, which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by
   nameless hands and chisels. High over its jagged rim huge ravens
   flapped and croaked, and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of
   bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless
   blackness. There Carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight
   with the rocky path sloping down before him; tall onyx cliffs on his
   right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left
   chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry.

   All at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control, leaping
   past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow
   slope toward the north. Stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over
   the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any
   sound of striking bottom; but Carter ignored the perils of that scanty
   path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed. Soon the
   left-behind cliffs resumed their course, making the way once more a
   narrow lane; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose
   great wide prints told of its desperate flight.

   Once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast, and
   doubled his speed from this encouragement. He was covering miles, and
   little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must
   soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north. The gaunt grey
   flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the
   right-hand crags, and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open
   space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain.
   And once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears, plainer than before,
   but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he
   realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing
   yak. The beats were ruthless and purposeful, and they were behind him.

   Carter's pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing,
   for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the
   presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable. His yak
   must have heard or felt it first, and he did not like to ask himself
   whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up
   out of that black quarry pit. Meanwhile the cliffs had been left
   behind, so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and
   spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost. He could not see the
   hoofprints of his yak, but always from behind him there came that
   detestable clopping; mingled now and then with what he fancied were
   titanic flappings and whirrings. That he was losing ground seemed
   unhappily clear to him, and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this
   broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands.
   Only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense
   of direction, and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned
   and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place.

   Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a
   terrible thing. He had thought it for some moments a range of black
   mountains, but now he saw it was something more. The phosphorescence of
   the brooding clouds shewed it plainly, and even silhouetted parts of it
   as vapours glowed behind. How distant it was he could not tell, but it
   must have been very far. It was thousands of feet high, stretching in a
   great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined
   westward spaces, and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills.
   But now these hills were hills no more, for some hand greater than
   man's had touched them. Silent they squatted there atop the world like
   wolves or ghouls, crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the
   secrets of the north forever. All in a great half circle they squatted,
   those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues, and
   their right hands were raised in menace against mankind.

   It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred
   double heads seem to move, but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from
   their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion. Winged
   and whirring, those forms grew larger each moment, and the traveller
   knew his stumbling was at an end. They were not any birds or bats known
   elsewhere on earth or in dreamland, for they were larger than elephants
   and had heads like a horse's. Carter knew that they must be the
   Shantak-birds of ill rumour, and wondered no more what evil guardians
   and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert. And as he
   stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him, where
   indeed was trotting the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend,
   grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering
   Shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether
   pits.

   Trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares
   that pressed around in great unholy circles, Randolph Carter did not
   lose consciousness. Lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered
   above him, while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from his yak and
   stood grinning before the captive. Then the man motioned Carter to
   mount one of the repugnant Shantaks, helping him up as his judgement
   struggled with his loathing. It was hard work ascending, for the
   Shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers, and those scales are very
   slippery. Once he was seated, the slant-eyed man hopped up behind him,
   leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven
   mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi.

   There now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up
   and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains
   beyond which Leng was said to be. Far above the clouds they flew, till
   at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of
   Inquanok have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of
   gleaming mist. Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below,
   and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of
   those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor about these things
   when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed Shantak appeared
   oddly fearful of them, hurrying past nervously and shewing great
   tension until they were left far in the rear.

   The Shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a
   grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires.
   As they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and
   bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light. And
   there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a
   nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that Inquanok's people
   are right in their geographic rumours. For travellers have heard such
   sounds before, and know that they float only from the cold desert
   plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and
   mystery which is Leng.

   Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious
   as to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have
   ever been to Leng, and the place is known only by its fires and stone
   huts as seen from afar. Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap,
   and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that
   Carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague
   legend, or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen
   plateau. As the Shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness of the dancers
   became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept
   straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had
   seen such creatures before.

   They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to
   wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing
   they had none, but most of them were quite furry. Behind they had
   dwarfish tails, and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width
   of their mouths. Then he knew what they were, and that they did not
   wear any wigs or headpieces after all. For the cryptic folk of Leng
   were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys
   that traded rubies at Dylath-Leen; those not quite human merchants who
   are the slaves of the monstrous moon-things! They were indeed the same
   dark folk who had shanghaied Carter on their noisome galley so long
   ago, and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean
   wharves of that accursed lunar city, with the leaner ones toiling and
   the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous
   and amorphous masters. Now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came
   from, and shuddered at the thought that Leng must be known to these
   formless abominations from the moon.

   But the Shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less
   than human dancers, and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and
   dim wastes of rock and ice and snow. Day came, and the phosphorescence
   of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world,
   and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence.
   At times the slant-eyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and
   guttural language, and the Shantak would answer with tittering tones
   that rasped like the scratching of ground glass. AlI this while the
   land was getting higher, and finally they came to a wind-swept
   table-land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless
   world. There, all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold, rose the
   uncouth stones of a squat windowless building, around which a circle of
   crude monoliths stood. In all this arrangement there was nothing human,
   and Carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most
   dreadful and legendary of all places, the remote and prehistoric
   monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the High-Priest Not To Be
   Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to
   the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   The loathsome bird now settled to the ground, and the slant-eyed man
   hopped down and helped his captive alight. Of the purpose of his
   seizure Carter now felt very sure; for clearly the slant-eyed merchant
   was an agent of the darker powers, eager to drag before his masters a
   mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown Kadath and
   the saying of a prayer before the faces of the Great Ones in their onyx
   castle. It seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former
   capture by the slaves of the moon-things in Dylath-Leen, and that he
   now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim
   to some dread rendezvous with monstrous Nyarlathotep and telling with
   what boldness the seeking of unknown Kadath had been tried. Leng and
   the cold waste north of Inquanok must be close to the Other Gods, and
   there the passes to Kadath are well guarded.

   The slant-eyed man was small, but the great hippocephalic bird was
   there to see he was obeyed; so Carter followed where he led, and passed
   within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of
   that windowless stone monastery. There were no lights inside, but the
   evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and
   prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors. On
   the walls of the corridors were printed frightful scenes older than
   history, and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth. After
   countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still, for the cold and
   dryness of hideous Leng keep alive many primal things. Carter saw them
   fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp, and shuddered at
   the tale they told.

   Through those archaic frescoes Leng's annals stalked; and the horned,
   hooved, and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten
   cities. There were scenes of old wars, wherein Leng's almost-humans
   fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and
   there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the
   moon, and of the submission of Leng's people to the polypous and
   amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of
   them. Those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they worshipped as gods,
   nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were
   taken away in the black galleys. The monstrous moon-beasts made their
   camp on a jagged isle in the sea, and Carter could tell from the
   frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had
   seen when sailing to Inquanok; that grey accursed rock which Inquanok's
   seamen shun, and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the
   night.

   And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the
   almost-humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt
   wharves, and wondrous with high fanes and carven places. Great gardens
   and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six
   sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza, and in that plaza was a
   pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene
   staircase. Again and again were those huge winged lions shewn, their
   mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and
   the cloudy phosphorescence of the night. And as Carter stumbled past
   their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed
   they were, and what city it was that the almost-humans had ruled so
   anciently before the coming of the black galleys. There could be no
   mistake, for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse.
   Indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied
   Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the
   first true human saw the light, and whose twin titan lions guard
   eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss.

   Other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing Leng from Inquanok,
   and the monstrous Shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way
   up. And they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost
   pinnacles, and how even the boldest of the Shantaks fly screaming away
   from them. Carter had seen those caves when he passed over them, and
   had noticed their likeness to the caves on Ngranek. Now he knew that
   the likeness was more than a chance one, for in these pictures were
   shewn their fearsome denizens; and those bat-wings, curving horns,
   barbed tails, prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to
   him. He had met those silent, flitting and clutching creatures before;
   those mindless guardians of the Great Abyss whom even the Great Ones
   fear, and who own not Nyarlathotep but hoary Nodens as their lord. For
   they were the dreaded night-gaunts, who never laugh or smile because
   they have no faces, and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the
   Vale of Pnath and the passes to the outer world.

   The slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space
   whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs, and whose centre held
   a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars
   in a ring. There was no light in this vast evil-smelling crypt, and the
   small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could
   grasp details only little by little. At the farther end was a high
   stone dais reached by five steps; and there on a golden throne sat a
   lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a
   yellow silken mask over its face. To this being the slant-eyed man made
   certain signs with his hands, and the lurker in the dark replied by
   raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk-covered paws and
   blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask.
   This colloquy went on for some time, and to Carter there was something
   sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the
   malodorous place. It made him think of a frightful red-litten city and
   of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that, and of
   an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond, before the rescuing
   rush of earth's friendly cats. He knew that the creature on the dais
   was without doubt the High-Priest Not To Be Described, of which legend
   whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities, but he feared to
   think just what that abhorred High-Priest might be.

   Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white
   paws, and Carter knew what the noisome High-Priest was. And in that
   hideous second, stark fear drove him to something his reason would
   never have dared to attempt, for in all his shaken consciousness there
   was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that
   golden throne. He knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt
   him and the cold table-land outside, and that even on that table-land
   the noxious Shantek still waited; yet in spite of all this there was in
   his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling,
   silk-robed monstrosity.

   The slant-eyed man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and
   wickedly stained altar-stones by the pit, and had moved forward
   somewhat to talk to the High-Priest with his hands. Carter, hitherto
   wholly passive, now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild
   strength of fear, so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping
   well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish Vaults of Zin
   where Gugs hunt ghasts in the dark. In almost the same second he seized
   the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths,
   racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think
   of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him, or
   of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back
   there in lightless corridors.

   After a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste, and wished he
   had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in.
   True, they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have
   done him much good, but he wished none the less he had made the
   attempt. Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had
   seen then, and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside. In
   time he became quite sure he was not followed, and slackened his pace
   somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a new peril
   beset him. His lamp was waning, and he would soon be in pitch blackness
   with no means of sight or guidance.

   When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark, and prayed to
   the Great Ones for such help as they might afford. At times he felt the
   stone floor sloping up or down, and once he stumbled over a step for
   which no reason seemed to exist. The farther he went the damper it
   seemed to be, and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a
   side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least.
   He believed, though, that his general course was down; and the
   vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike
   warned him he was burrowing deep in Leng's unwholesome table-land. But
   there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the
   thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos. One
   moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level
   place, and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark
   through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical.

   Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it
   seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he
   realized he was still, with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern
   night shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and
   broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by
   straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots.
   Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side
   sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven
   entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead
   stretched double rows of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of
   pillars, that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and
   basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens. Far
   off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza, and in
   that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a
   pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions of diarite they were, with
   blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet they reared their
   grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around
   them. And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legend tells of
   only one such twain. They were the changeless guardians of the Great
   Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth primordial Sarkomand.

   Carter's first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff
   with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around. He wished no
   follower from Leng's hateful monastery, for along the way ahead would
   lurk enough of other dangers. Of how to get from Sarkomand to the
   peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain
   much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls, since he knew they
   were no better informed than he. The three ghouls which had helped him
   through the city of Gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach
   Sarkomand in their journey back, but had planned to ask old traders in
   Dylath-Leen. He did not like to think of going again to the subterrene
   world of Gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its
   Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might
   have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng's plateau past
   the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the High-Priest's
   emissaries must be many, while at the journey's end there would no
   doubt be the Shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with. If he
   could get a boat he might sail back to Inquanok past the jagged and
   hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in the monastery
   labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from
   Sarkomand's basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city
   was no probable thing, and it did not appear likely that he could ever
   make one.

   Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began
   beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him
   the great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken
   pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and
   monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night
   clouds. Now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds
   could account for, and knew he was not alone in the silence of that
   dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish
   tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept closer,
   down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled
   walls, he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many
   vague forms clustered darkly around it; and a lethal odour hanging
   heavily over all. Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with
   a great ship riding at anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when
   he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from
   the moon.

   Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he
   saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and
   unmistakable sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a
   moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he
   was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to
   conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating. Once
   in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach, and in
   another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among
   heaps of fallen marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery,
   so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where
   he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action. There around a
   hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi, there squatted
   a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their almost-human
   slaves. Some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the
   leaping flames, and at intervals applying their white-hot points to
   three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of
   the party. From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that
   the blunt-snouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely, and
   vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and
   knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio
   which had guided him safely from the abyss, and had thereafter set out
   from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate to their native
   deeps.

   The number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very
   great, and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former
   allies. Of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but
   fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in
   Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to
   approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the High-Priest Not
   To Be Described. For a moment he pondered on what he ought to do, and
   recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls' black kingdom.
   Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and
   descend at once to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors
   worse than those above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to
   rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the
   black galley. It occurred to him that the portal, like other gates to
   the abyss, might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not
   fear these faceless creatures now. He had learned that they are bound
   by solemn treaties with the ghouls, and the ghoul which was Pickman had
   taught him how to glibber a password they understood.

   So Carter began another silent crawl through the ruins, edging slowly
   toward the great central plaza and the winged lions. It was ticklish
   work, but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the
   slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered
   stones. At last he reached the open space and picked his way among the
   stunned trees and vines that had grown up therein. The gigantic lions
   loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent
   night clouds, but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept
   round to their faces, knowing it was on that side he would find the
   mighty darkness which they guard. Ten feet apart crouched the
   mocking-faced beasts of diarite, brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose
   sides were chiselled in fearsome bas-reliefs. Betwixt them was a tiled
   court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of
   onyx. Midway in this space a black well opened, and Carter soon saw
   that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy
   stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare.

   Terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore
   themselves away whilst Carter wound sightlessly round and round down a
   fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs. So worn and narrow were
   the steps, and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth, that the climber
   never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to
   the ultimate pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the
   guardian night-gaunts would suddenly pounce upon him, if indeed there
   were any stationed in this primeval passage. All about him was a
   stifling odour of nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these
   choking depths was not made for mankind. In time he became very numb
   and somnolent, moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned
   will; nor did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether
   as something quietly seized him from behind. He was flying very rapidly
   through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery
   night-gaunts had performed their duty.

   Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless
   flutterers, Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered
   it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight. Mindless
   though night-gaunts are said to be, the effect was instantaneous; for
   all tickling stopped at once, and the creatures hastened to shift their
   captive to a more comfortable position. Thus encouraged Carter ventured
   some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls
   by the moonbeasts, and of the need of assembling a party to rescue
   them. The night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what
   was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight.
   Suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner
   earth, and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on
   which ghouls love to squat and gnaw. Scattered tombstones and osseous
   fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as Carter gave a loud
   meep of urgent summons, a score of burrows emptied forth their
   leathery, dog-like tenants. The night-gaunts now flew low and set their
   passenger upon his feet, afterward withdrawing a little and forming a
   hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer.

   Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque
   company, and four of them at once departed through different burrows to
   spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available
   for a rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared,
   and made significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the
   latter to fly off into the dark. Thereafter there were constant
   accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain, till at
   length the slimy soil was fairly black with them. Meanwhile fresh
   ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one, all glibbering excitedly
   and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled
   night-gaunts. In time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul
   which was once the artist Richard Pickman of Boston, and to him Carter
   glibbered a very full account of what had occurred. The erstwhile
   Pickman, pleased to greet his ancient friend again, seemed very much
   impressed, and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from
   the growing throng.

   Finally, after scanning the ranks with care, the assembled chiefs all
   meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls
   and night-gaunts. A large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at
   once, while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with
   extended forelegs, awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one. As
   each ghoul reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned,
   he was taken up and borne away into the blackness; till at last the
   whole throng had vanished save for Carter, Pickman, and the other
   chiefs, and a few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that
   night-gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls, and
   that the army was issuing forth to Sarkomand to deal with the
   moonbeasts. Then Carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting
   bearers and were taken up by the damp, slippery paws. Another moment
   and all were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly up, up, up to the
   gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal Sarkomand.

   When, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of
   Sarkomand's nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza
   swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must
   be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy
   would be needed. The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered
   faintly, though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture
   of the prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly glibbering directions
   to their steeds and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead, the
   ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the
   bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the
   front rank of ghouls, and saw as they approached the noisome camp that
   the moonbeasts were totally unprepared. The three prisoners lay bound
   and inert beside the fire, while their toadlike captors slumped
   drowsily about in no certain order. The almost-human slaves were
   asleep, even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must
   have seemed to them merely perfunctory.

   The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden,
   each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almost-human slaves
   being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The
   moonbeasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little
   chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible
   were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the
   sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the
   strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moonbeast writhed too
   violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink
   tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its
   struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the
   ghouls were far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple
   orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest
   to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away
   into the Great Abyss, to be distributed impartially amongst the Dholes,
   Gugs, ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment
   are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound
   ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk,
   whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for possible remaining
   moonbeasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to
   make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat. Surely enough,
   the capture had been thorough, for not a sign of further life could the
   victors detect. Carter, anxious to preserve a means of access to the
   rest of dreamland, urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this
   request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting
   the plight of the captured trio. On the ship were found some very
   curious objects and decorations, some of which Carter cast at once into
   the sea.

   Ghouls and night-gaunts now formed themselves in separate groups, the
   former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings. It
   appeared that the three had followed Carter's directions and proceeded
   from the enchanted wood to Dylath-Leen by way of Nir and the Skai,
   stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as
   possible in the fashion of a man's walk. In Dylath-Leen's taverns their
   grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment; but they had
   persisted in asking the way to Sarkomand until at last an old traveller
   was able to tell them. Then they knew that only a ship for Lelag-Leng
   would serve their purpose, and prepared to wait patiently for such a
   vessel.

   But evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley
   put into port, and the wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls
   to drink with them in a tavern. Wine was produced from one of those
   sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby, and after that
   the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as Carter had
   found himself. This time, however, the unseen rowers steered not for
   the moon but for antique Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their
   captives before the High-Priest Not To Be Described. They had touched
   at the jagged rock in the northern sea which Inquanok's mariners shun,
   and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the red masters of the
   ship; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of
   malign shapelessness and fearsome odour. There, too, were witnessed the
   nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrison-such pastimes as
   give rise to the night-howlings which men fear. After that had come the
   landing at ruined Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures, whose
   continuance the present rescue had prevented.

   Future plans were next discussed, the three rescued ghouls suggesting a
   raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison
   there. To this, however, the night-gaunts objected; since the prospect
   of flying over water did not please them. Most of the ghouls favoured
   the design, but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the
   winged night-gaunts. Thereupon Carter, seeing that they could not
   navigate the anchored galley, offered to teach them the use of the
   great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented. Grey day
   had now come, and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of
   ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers'
   benches. Carter found them fairly apt at learning, and before night had
   risked several experimental trips around the harbour. Not till three
   days later, however, did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of
   conquest. Then, the rowers trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed
   in the forecastle, the party set sail at last; Pickman and the other
   chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and
   procedure.

   On the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard. Such was
   their timbre that all the galley's crew shook visibly; but most of all
   trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those
   howlings meant. It was not thought best to attempt an attack by night,
   so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn
   of a greyish day. when the light was ample and the howlings still the
   rowers resumed their strokes, and the galley drew closer and closer to
   that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the
   dull sky. The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and
   there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings,
   and the low railings guarding travelled highroads. No ship of men had
   ever come so near the place, or at least, had never come so near and
   departed again; but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept
   inflexibly on, rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the
   wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side
   within a harbour formed of steep headlands.

   The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so
   closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them.
   There seemed to be no watchers on the outside, so the galley was
   steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant
   putrid harbour beyond. Here, however, all was bustle and activity; with
   several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay, and scores
   of almost-human slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates
   and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering
   lorries. There was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff
   above the wharves, with the start of a winding road that spiralled out
   of sight toward higher ledges of the rock. Of what lay inside that
   prodigious peak of granite none might say, but the things one saw on
   the outside were far from encouraging.

   At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed
   much eagerness; those with eyes staring intently, and those without
   eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly. They did not, of
   course, realize that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look
   much like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts
   were all out of sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed
   a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was
   touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the
   instincts of those almost-mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the
   horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they
   found there, and afterward, quite helpless to think except in terms of
   the homing instinct, would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly
   back to the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate
   destinations in the dark, from which not much would emerge alive.

   The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts
   their simple instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous
   and malodorous wharves. Presently a fresh stir rose along the
   waterfront, and Carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to
   excite suspicion. Evidently the steersman was not making for the right
   dock, and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the
   hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves whose places they were
   taking. Some silent alarm must have been given, for almost at once a
   horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black
   doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the
   right. A rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the
   wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this
   point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of
   whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of
   horned and cyclopean bats.

   The jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to
   push off the invading ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they
   thought of such things no more. It was a very terrible spectacle to see
   those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime, and tremendously
   impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town
   and up the winding roadway to the reaches above. Sometimes a group of
   the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by
   mistake, and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly
   offensive to the sight and smell. When the last of the night-gaunts had
   left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal,
   and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey
   headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest.

   The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up
   their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea,
   and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he
   waited, and dressed the wounds of the injured men. Night fell, and the
   grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds,
   and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed
   rock for signs of the night-gaunts' flight. Toward morning a black
   speck was seen hovering timidly over the top-most pinnacle, and shortly
   afterward the speck had become a swarm. Just before daybreak the swarm
   seemed to scatter, and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished
   wholly in the distance toward the northeast. Once or twice something
   seemed to fall from the thing swarm into the sea; but Carter did not
   worry, since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts
   cannot swim. At length, when the ghouls were satisfied that all the
   night-gaunts had left for Sarkomand and the Great Abyss with their
   doomed burdens, the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey
   headlands; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over
   the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled
   from the solid stone.

   Frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless
   crypts; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many, and in
   various stages of departure from their primal state. Carter put out of
   the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled
   precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very
   positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque
   stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside with
   nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and
   ornaments lay about, including some large idols of solid ruby depicting
   singular beings not found on the earth. These latter did not, despite
   their material, invite either appropriation or long inspection; and
   Carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces.
   The scattered spears and javelins he collected, and with Pickman's
   approval distributed among the ghouls. Such devices were new to the
   doglike lopers, but their relative simplicity made them easy to master
   after a few concise hints.

   The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and
   in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and
   doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more
   monstrous than the wild gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great
   temple stretched a low black passage which Carter followed far into the
   rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast
   proportions, whose vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in
   whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous
   monastery of Leng where broods alone the High-Priest Not To Be
   Described. On the distant shadowy side, beyond the noisome well, he
   thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze; but for
   some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even
   approaching it, and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely
   allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could
   scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the
   moonbeasts, and had profited in their fashion. They had also found a
   hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the wharves
   for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued
   trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned their
   company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a
   great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the
   water; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost
   all interest in them. Carter did not try to carry any away, since he
   knew too much about those which had mined them.

   Suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the
   wharves, and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to
   stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront. Betwixt the grey
   headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing, and it would be
   but a moment before the almost-humans on deck would perceive the
   invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below.
   Fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which Carter
   had distributed amongst them; and at his command, sustained by the
   being that was Pickman, they now formed a line of battle and prepared
   to prevent the landing of the ship. Presently a burst of excitement on
   the galley told of the crew's discovery of the changed state of things,
   and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers
   of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account. After a moment of
   hesitation the new comers silently turned and passed out between the
   headlands again, but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the
   conflict was averted. Either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or
   the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island; hence a party of
   scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy's
   course would be.

   In a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the
   moonbeasts and almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more
   easterly of the rugged grey headlands, and ascending by hidden paths
   and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety. Almost
   immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the
   flume-like strait, but only for a second. Then a few moments later, a
   second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was
   landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the
   size of the galley would seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving
   slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight
   betwixt the cliffs, and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the
   coming fray and stand by for any possible use.

   By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three
   parties, one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain
   in the town. The first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their
   respective directions, while the third was subdivided into a land party
   and a sea party. The sea party, commanded by Carter, boarded the
   anchored galley and rowed out to meet the under-manned galley of the
   newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open
   sea. Carter did not at once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed
   more acutely near the town.

   Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almost-humans
   had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly
   silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky. The thin
   hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine, and the general
   effect of those hybrid, half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as
   the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies. Then the
   two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted
   panorama. Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the swelling meeps
   of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually
   joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and
   indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony. Now and then bodies fell from
   the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour
   inside, in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain
   submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious
   bubbles.

   For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west
   cliff the invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff,
   however, where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be
   present, the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating
   to the slopes of the pinnacle proper. Pickman had quickly ordered
   reinforcements for this front from the party in the town, and these had
   helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat. Then, when the
   western battle was over, the victorious survivors hastened across to
   the aid of their hard-pressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the
   invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland. The
   almost-humans were by this time all slain, but the last of the toadlike
   horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their
   powerful and disgusting paws. The time for javelins was now nearly
   past, and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest of what few spearmen
   could meet upon that narrow ridge.

   As fury and recklessness increased, the number falling into the sea
   became very great. Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction
   from the unseen bubblers, but of those striking the open sea some were
   able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks, while
   the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts. The cliffs
   were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked, so that none of
   the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle-line. Some were
   killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts
   above, but a few survived to be rescued. When the security of the land
   parties seemed assured, Carter's galley sallied forth between the
   headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue
   such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean.
   Several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of
   the way.

   Finally, the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the
   invading land army concentrated in one place, Carter landed a
   considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemy's rear; after
   which the fight was short-lived indeed. Attacked from both sides, the
   noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea,
   till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again
   clear of them. The hostile galley, meanwhile, had disappeared; and it
   was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before
   any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought
   against the victors.

   So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted
   them with care, finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day's
   battles. The wounded were placed on bunks in the galley, for Pickman
   always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one's
   own wounded, and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to
   such other places as they might most usefully fill. Under the low
   phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed, and Carter was not
   sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets, whose
   lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door
   lingered restlessly in his fancy. Dawn found the ship in sight of
   Sarkomand's ruined quays of basalt, where a few night-gaunt sentries
   still waited, squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken
   columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and
   died before the years of man.

   The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand,
   despatching a messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as
   steeds. Pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude
   for the aid Carter had lent them. Carter now began to feel that his
   plans were indeed maturing well, and that he would be able to command
   the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of
   dreamland, but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown
   Kadath, and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from
   his slumbers. Accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish
   leaders; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands
   and of the monstrous Shantaks and the mountains carven into
   double-headed images which guard it. He spoke of the fear of Shantaks
   for night-gaunts, and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming
   from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide
   Inquanok from hateful Leng. He spoke, too, of the things he had learned
   concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery
   of the High-Priest Not To Be Described; how even the Great Ones fear
   them, and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep at
   all, but hoary and immemorial Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss.

   All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls, and
   presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did
   not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately
   rendered the rubbery doglike lopers. He wished very much, he said, for
   the services of enough night-gaunts to bear him safely through the aft
   past the realm of Shantaks and carven mountains, and up into the old
   waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal. He desired to
   fly to the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead
   with the Great Ones for the sunset city they denied him, and felt sure
   that the night-gaunts could take him thither without trouble; high
   above the perils of the plain, and over the hideous double heads of
   those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk.
   For the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from
   aught of earth since the Great Ones themselves dread them. And even
   were unexpected things to come from the Other Gods, who are prone to
   oversee the affairs of earth's milder gods, the night-gaunts need not
   fear; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and
   slippery flyers as own not Nyarlathotep for their master, but bow only
   to potent and archaic Nodens.

   A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts, Carter glibbered, would surely
   be enough to keep any combination of Shantaks at a distance, though
   perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the
   creatures, their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than
   to men. The party could land him at some convenient point within
   whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have, waiting in the
   shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the
   castle to give prayer to the gods of earth. If any ghouls chose to
   escort him into the throne-room of the Great Ones, he would be
   thankful, for their presence would add weight and importance to his
   plea. He would not, however, insist upon this but merely wished
   transportation to and from the castle atop unknown Kadath; the final
   journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself, in case of
   gods proved favourable, or back to the earthward Gate of Deeper Slumber
   in the Enchanted Wood in case his prayers were fruitless.

   Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great
   attention, and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds
   of those night-gaunts for which messengers had been sent. The winged
   steeds settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army, waiting
   respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the
   earthly traveller. The ghoul that was Pickman glibbered gravely with
   his fellows and in the end Carter was offered far more than he had at
   most expected. As he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the
   moonbeasts, so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence
   none had ever returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied
   night-gaunts, but their entire army as then encamped, veteran fighting
   ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike, save only a small
   garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from
   the jagged rock in the sea. They would set out through the aft whenever
   he might wish, and once arrived on Kadath a suitable train of ghouls
   would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earth's gods
   in their onyx castle.

   Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words, Carter made plans
   with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage. The army would fly
   high, they decided, over hideous Leng with its nameless monastery and
   wicked stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer
   with the Shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed
   their summits. They would then, according to what advice they might
   receive from those denizens, choose their final course; approaching
   unknown Kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of
   Inquanok, or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive Leng
   itself. Doglike and soulless as they are, the ghouls and night-gaunts
   had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal; nor did they
   feel any deterring awe at the thought of Kadath towering lone with its
   onyx castle of mystery.

   About midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight, each
   ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him. Carter
   was placed well up toward the head of the column beside Pickman, and in
   front of the whole a double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided
   as a vanguard. At a brisk meep from Pickman the whole shocking army
   rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling
   sphinxes of primordial Sarkomand; higher and higher, till even the
   great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared, and the cold, sterile
   table-land of Leng's outskirts laid open to sight. Still higher flew
   the black host, till even this table-land grew small beneath them; and
   as they worked northward over the wind-swept plateau of horror Carter
   saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the
   squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful
   silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped.
   This time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the
   sterile landscape, passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone
   villages at a great altitude, and pausing not at all to mark the morbid
   twistings of the hooved, horned almost-humans that dance and pipe
   eternally therein. Once they saw a Shantak-bird flying low over the
   plain, but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to
   the north in grotesque panic.

   At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of
   Inquanok, and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which
   Carter recalled as so frightful to the Shantaks. At the insistent
   meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty
   burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and
   night-gaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly
   gestures. It soon became clear that the best course would be that over
   the cold waste north of Inquanok, for Leng's northward reaches are full
   of unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal
   influences centering in certain white hemispherical buildings on
   curious knolls, which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the
   Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing, save that
   there must be some mighty marvel toward the north, over which the
   Shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard. They hinted at rumoured
   abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond, and
   recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally; but of
   definite data they had nothing to give. So Carter and his party thanked
   them kindly; and, crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies
   of Inquanok, dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds
   and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were
   mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock.

   There they squatted in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert
   sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolflike,
   and double-headed, with faces of fury and right hands raised, dully and
   malignly watching the rim of man's world and guarding with horror the
   reaches of a cold northern world that is not man's. From their hideous
   laps rose evil Shantaks of elephantine bulk, but these all fled with
   insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty
   sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew, and over
   leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less
   luminous grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only
   blackness around him; but never did the winged steeds falter, bred as
   they were in earth's blackest crypts, and seeing not with any eyes, but
   with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms. On and on they
   flew, past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in
   thickest darkness, and covering such prodigious spaces that Carter
   wondered whether or not they could still be within earth's dreamland.

   Then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above.
   All below was still black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed
   alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed
   elsewhere. It was not that the figures of the constellations were
   different, but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a
   significance they had formerly failed to make plain. Everything
   focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the glittering
   sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the
   eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal
   of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead.
   Carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks
   had towered along all the length of Inquanok and saw against the stars
   a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence. It was more
   broken now, with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles;
   and Carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and inclinations of
   that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the stars some
   subtle northward urge.

   They were flying past at a tremendous speed, so that the watcher had to
   strain hard to catch details; when all at once he beheld just above the
   line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars,
   whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party. The
   ghouls had likewise glimpsed it, for he heard their low glibbering all
   about him, and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic
   Shantak, of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen.
   Soon, however, he saw that this theory would not hold; for the shape of
   the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird.
   Its outline against the stars, necessarily vague as it was, resembled
   rather some huge mitred head, or pair of heads infinitely magnified;
   and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a
   wingless one. Carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was
   on, but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first
   seen, since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was
   deeply cleft.

   Then came a wide gap in the range, where the hideous reaches of
   transmontane Leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low
   pass through which the stars shone wanly. Carter watched this gap with
   intense care, knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond
   it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the
   pinnacles. The object had now floated ahead a trifle, and every eye of
   the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in
   full-length silhouette. Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared
   the gap, slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having
   outdistanced the ghoulish army. For another minute suspense was keen,
   and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came;
   bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of
   cosmic fear, and to the soul of the traveller a chill that never wholly
   left it. For the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was
   only a head--a mitred double head--and below it in terrible vastness
   loped the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountain-high
   monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence; the hyaena-like
   distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the
   sky, its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching half way to the
   zenith.

   Carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud, for he was an
   old dreamer; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he
   saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level
   of the peaks, bobbing along stealthily after the first one. And
   straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full
   against the southern stars, tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly, their
   tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft. The carven mountains,
   then, had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of
   Inquanok, with right hands uplifted. They had duties to perform, and
   were not remiss. But it was horrible that they never spoke, and never
   even made a sound in walking.

   Meanwhile the ghoul that was Pickman had glibbered an order to the
   night-gaunts, and the whole army soared higher into the air. Up toward
   the stars the grotesque column shot, till nothing stood out any longer
   against the sky; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the
   carven mitred mountains that walked. All was blackness beneath as the
   fluttering legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible
   laughter in the aether, and never a Shantak or less mentionable entity
   rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them. The farther they went, the
   faster they flew, till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of
   a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit. Carter
   wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath
   them, but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange
   properties. That they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain,
   and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasized
   their northward focus; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the
   flying army into the void of the boreal pole, as the folds of a bag are
   gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein.

   Then he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not
   flapping any more. The horned and faceless steeds had folded their
   membranous appendages, and were resting quite passive in the chaos of
   wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on. A force not of earth
   had seized on the army, and ghouls and night-gaunts alike were
   powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the
   north whence no mortal had ever returned. At length a lone pallid light
   was seen on the skyline ahead, thereafter rising steadily as they
   approached, and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the
   stars. Carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain, for only a
   mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the
   air.

   Higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it, till all
   the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass. Lofty as the
   army was, that pale and sinister beacon rose above it, towering
   monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth, and tasting the
   atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel. No
   mountain known of man was that which loomed before them. The high
   clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills. The groping
   dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins. Scornful and
   spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven, black in eternal
   night, and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and
   significant outline grew every moment clearer. Ghouls meeped in wonder
   as they saw it, and Carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army
   be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliff.

   Higher and higher rose the light, till it mingled with the loftiest
   orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery.
   All the north beneath it was blackness now; dread, stony blackness from
   infinite depths to infinite heights, with only that pale winking beacon
   perched unreachably at the top of all vision. Carter studied the light
   more closely, and saw at last what lines its inky background made
   against the stars. There were towers on that titan mountaintop;
   horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters
   beyond any dreamable workmanship of man; battlements and terraces of
   wonder and menace, all limned tiny and black and distant against the
   starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight.
   Capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all
   mortal thought, and in it glowed the daemon-light. Then Randolph Carter
   knew that his quest was done, and that he saw above him the goal of all
   forbidden steps and audacious visions; the fabulous, the incredible
   home of the Great Ones atop unknown Kadath.

   Even as he realised this thing, Carter noticed a change in the course
   of the helplessly wind-sucked party. They were rising abruptly now, and
   it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where
   the pale light shone. So close was the great black mountain that its
   sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward, and in the darkness
   they could discern nothing upon it. Vaster and vaster loomed the
   tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above, and Carter could see that
   it was well-nigh blasphemous in its immensity. Well might its stones
   have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out
   of the rock in the hill pass north of Inquanok, for such was its size
   that a man on its threshold stood even as air out on the steps of
   earth's loftiest fortress. The pshent of unknown stars above the myriad
   domed turrets glowed with a sallow, sickly flare, so that a kind of
   twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx. The pallid beacon
   was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the
   loftiest towers, and as the helpless army neared the top of the
   mountain Carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across
   the feebly luminous expanse. It was a strangely arched window, of a
   design wholly alien to earth.

   The solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous
   castle, and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated.
   Vast walls shot up, and there was a glimpse of a great gate through
   which the voyagers were swept. All was night in the titan courtyard,
   and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched
   portal engulfed the column. Vortices of cold wind surged dankly through
   sightless labyrinths of onyx, and Carter could never tell what
   Cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his
   endless aerial twisting. Always upward led the terrible plunge in
   darkness, and never a sound, touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of
   mystery. Large as the army of ghouls and night-gaunts was, it was lost
   in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle. And when at
   last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single
   tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon, it took Carter
   long to discern the far walls and high, distant ceiling, and to realize
   that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside.

   Randolph Carter had hoped to come into the throne-room of the Great
   Ones with poise and dignity, flanked and followed by impressive lines
   of ghouls in ceremonial order, and offering his prayer as a free and
   potent master among dreamers. He had known that the Great Ones
   themselves are not beyond a mortal's power to cope with, and had
   trusted to luck that the Other Gods and their crawling chaos
   Nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial
   moment, as they had so often done before when men sought out earth's
   gods in their home or on their mountains. And with his hideous escort
   he had half hoped to defy even the Other Gods if need were, knowing as
   he did that ghouls have no masters, and that night-gaunts own not
   Nyarlathotep but only archaic Nodens for their lord. But now he saw
   that supernal Kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders
   and nameless sentinels, and that the Other Gods are of a surety
   vigilant in guarding the mild, feeble gods of earth. Void as they are
   of lordship over ghouls and night-gaunts, the mindless, shapeless
   blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must; so that
   it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that
   Randolph Carter came into the Great Ones' throne-room with his ghouls.
   Swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars, and dogged by
   unseen horrors of the northern waste, all that army floated captive and
   helpless in the lurid light, dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by
   some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved.

   Before no golden dais had Randolph Carter come, nor was there any
   august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes, long-lobed
   ears, thin nose, and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on
   Ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray. Save
   for the one tower room the onyx castle atop Kadath was dark, and the
   masters were not there. Carter had come to unknown Kadath in the cold
   waste, but he had not found the gods. Yet still the lurid light glowed
   in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all
   outdoors, and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight
   in thin, curling mists. Earth's gods were not there, it was true, but
   of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack. Where the
   mild gods are absent, the Other Gods are not unrepresented; and
   certainly, the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless. In what
   outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself Carter could
   by no means imagine. He felt that his visit had been expected, and
   wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the
   crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. It is Nyarlathotep, horror of infinite
   shapes and dread soul and messenger of the Other Gods, that the fungous
   moonbeasts serve; and Carter thought of the black galley that had
   vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike
   abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea.

   Reflecting upon these things, he was staggering to his feet in the
   midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through
   that pale-litten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon
   trumpet. Three times pealed that frightful brazen scream, and when the
   echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away Randolph Carter saw
   that he was alone. Whither, why and how the ghouls and night-gaunts had
   been snatched from sight was not for him to divine. He knew only that
   he was suddenly alone, and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly
   around him were no powers of earth's friendly dreamland. Presently from
   the chamber's uttermost reaches a new sound came. This, too, was a
   rhythmic trumpeting; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous
   blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts. In this low fanfare
   echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream; exotic vistas of
   unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien
   cadence. Odours of incense came to match the golden notes; and overhead
   a great light dawned, its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth's
   spectrum, and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic
   harmonies. Torches flared in the distance, and the beat of drums
   throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy.

   Out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin
   columns of giant black slaves with loin-cloths of iridescent silk. Upon
   their heads were strapped vast helmet-like torches of glittering metal,
   from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals.
   In their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into
   leering chimaeras, while their left hands grasped long thin silver
   trumpets which they blew in turn. Armlets and anklets of gold they had,
   and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its
   wearer to a sober gait. That they were true black men of earth's
   dreamland was at once apparent, but it seemed less likely that their
   rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth. Ten feet from
   Carter the columns stopped, and as they did so each trumpet flew
   abruptly to its bearer's thick lips. Wild and ecstatic was the blast
   that followed, and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from
   dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice.

   Then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a
   tall, slim figure with the young face of an antique Pharaoh, gay with
   prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with
   inherent light. Close up to Carter strode that regal figure; whose
   proud carriage and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark
   god or fallen archangel, and around whose eyes there lurked the languid
   sparkle of capricious humour. It spoke, and in its mellow tones there
   rippled the wild music of Lethean streams.

   "Randolph Carter," said the voice, "you have come to see the Great Ones
   whom it is unlawful for men to see. Watchers have spoken of this thing,
   and the Other Gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly
   to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the
   daemon-sultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud.

   "When Barzai the Wise climbed Hatheg-Kia to see the Greater Ones dance
   and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned. The Other
   Gods were there, and they did what was expected. Zenig of Aphorat
   sought to reach unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and his skull is now
   set in a ring on the little finger of one whom I need not name.

   "But you, Randolph Carter, have braved all things of earth's dreamland,
   and burn still with the flame of quest. You came not as one curious,
   but as one seeking his due, nor have you failed ever in reverence
   toward the mild gods of earth. Yet have these gods kept you from the
   marvellous sunset city of your dreams, and wholly through their own
   small covetousness; for verily, they craved the weird loveliness of
   that which your fancy had fashioned, and vowed that henceforward no
   other spot should be their abode.

   "They are gone from their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in your
   marvellous city. All through its palaces of veined marble they revel by
   day, and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and
   watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades, arched bridges and
   silver-basined fountains, and wide streets with blossom-laden urns and
   ivory statues in gleaming rows. And when night comes they climb tall
   terraces in the dew, and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the
   stars, or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the town's steep
   northward slopes, where one by one the little windows in old peaked
   gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles.

   "The gods love your marvellous city, and walk no more in the ways of
   the gods. They have forgotten the high places of earth, and the
   mountains that knew their youth. The earth has no longer any gods that
   are gods, and only the Other Ones from outer space hold sway on
   unremembered Kadath. Far away in a valley of your own childhood,
   Randolph Carter, play the heedless Great Ones. You have dreamed too
   well, O wise arch-dreamer, for you have drawn dream's gods away from
   the world of all men's visions to that which is wholly yours; having
   builded out of your boyhood's small fancies a city more lovely than all
   the phantoms that have gone before.

   "It is not well that earth's gods leave their thrones for the spider to
   spin on, and their realm for the Others to sway in the dark manner of
   Others. Fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to
   you, Randolph Carter, who are the cause of their upsetting, but that
   they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their
   world. In that half-waking dreamland which is yours, no power of
   uttermost night may pursue; and only you can send the selfish Great
   Ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city, back through the
   northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown Kadath in the cold
   waste.

   "So. Randolph Carter, in the name of the Other Gods I spare you and
   charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours, and to send thence
   the drowsy truant gods for whom the dream world waits. Not hard to find
   is that roseal fever of the gods, that fanfare of supernal trumpets and
   clash of immortal cymbals, that mystery whose place and meaning have
   haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming, and
   tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things
   awesome and momentous. Not hard to find is that symbol and relic of
   your days of wonder, for truly, it is but the stable and eternal gem
   wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening
   path. Behold! It is not over unknown seas but back over well-known
   years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of
   infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes
   brought to wide young eyes.

   "For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum
   of what you have seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston's
   hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset, of the
   flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
   gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles
   flows drowsily. These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse
   first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last
   things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love. And there is
   antique Salem with its brooding years, and spectral Marblehead scaling
   its rocky precipices into past centuries! And the glory of Salem's
   towers and spires seen afar from Marblehead's pastures across the
   harbour against the setting sun.

   "There is Providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue
   harbour, with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of
   living antiquity, and Newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming
   breakwater. Arkham is there, with its moss-grown gambrel roofs and the
   rocky rolling meadows behind it; and antediluvian Kingsport hoary with
   stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables, and the
   marvel of high cliffs and the milky-misted ocean with tolling buoys
   beyond.

   "Cool vales in Concord, cobbled lands in Portsmouth, twilight bends of
   rustic New Hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse
   walls and creaking well-sweeps. Gloucester's salt wharves and Truro's
   windy willows. Vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills
   along the North Shore, hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in
   the lee of huge boulders in Rhode Island's back country. Scent of the
   sea and fragrance of the fields; spell of the dark woods and joy of the
   orchards and gardens at dawn. These, Randolph Carter, are your city;
   for they are yourself. New England bore you, and into your soul she
   poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die. This loveliness, moulded,
   crystallised, and polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your
   terraced wonder of elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet
   with curious urns and carven rail, and descend at last these endless
   balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains,
   you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful
   boyhood.

   "Look! through that window shine the stars of eternal night. Even now
   they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished,
   drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the
   gardens of dream. There is Antares-he is winking at this moment over
   the roofs of Tremont Street, and you could see him from your window on
   Beacon Hill. Out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my
   mindless masters have sent me. Some day you too may traverse them, but
   if you are wise you will beware such folly; for of those mortals who
   have been and returned, only one preserves a mind unshattered by the
   pounding, clawing horrors of the void. Terrors and blasphemies gnaw at
   one another for space, and there is more evil in the lesser ones than
   in the greater; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to
   deliver you into my hands, whilst I myself harboured no wish to shatter
   you, and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had I not been
   elsewhere busy,and certain that you would yourself find the way. Shun
   then, the outer hells, and stick to the calm, lovely things of your
   youth. Seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant
   Great Ones, sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their
   own youth, and which wait uneasy for their return.

   "Easier even then the way of dim memory is the way I will prepare for
   you. See! There comes hither a monstrous Shantak, led by a slave who
   for your peace of mind had best keep invisible. Mount and be
   ready--there! Yogash the Black will help you on the scaly horror. Steer
   for that brightest star just south of the zenith--it is Vega, and in
   two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city. Steer for
   it only till you hear a far-off singing in the high aether. Higher than
   that lurks madness, so rein your Shantak when the first note lures.
   Look then back to earth, and you will see shining the deathless
   altar-flame of Ired-Naa from the sacred roof of a temple. That temple
   is in your desiderate sunset city, so steer for it before you heed the
   singing and are lost.

   "When you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of
   old you scanned the outspread glory, prodding the Shantak till he cry
   aloud. That cry the Great Ones will hear and know as they sit on their
   perfumed terraces, and there will come upon them such a homesickness
   that all of your city's wonders will not console them for the absence
   of Kadath's grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it.

   "Then must you land amongst them with the Shantak, and let them see and
   touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird; meanwhile discoursing to
   them of unknown Kadath, which you will so lately have left, and telling
   them how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted, where of old
   they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance. And the Shantak will
   talk to them in the manner of Shantaks, but it will have no powers of
   persuasion beyond the recalling of elder days.

   "Over and over must you speak to the wandering Great Ones of their home
   and youth, till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the
   returning path they have forgotten. Thereat can you loose the waiting
   Shantak, sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind; hearing
   which the Great Ones will prance and jump with antique mirth, and
   forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods, through
   the deep gulfs of heaven to Kadath's familiar towers and domes.

   "Then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit
   for ever, and once more will earth's gods rule the dreams of men from
   their accustomed seat. Go now--the casement is open and the stars await
   outside. Already your Shantak wheezes and titters with impatience.
   Steer for Vega through the night, but turn when the singing sounds.
   Forget not this warning, lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the
   gulf of shrieking and ululant madness. Remember the Other Gods; they
   are great and mindless and terrible, and lurk in the outer voids. They
   are good gods to shun.

   "Hei! Aa-shanta 'nygh! You are off! Send back earth's gods to their
   haunts on unknown Kadath, and pray to all space that you may never meet
   me in my thousand other forms. Farewell, Randolph Carter, and beware;
   for I am Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos."

   And Randolph Carter, gasping and dizzy on his hideous Shantak, shot
   screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal Vega;
   looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the
   onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window
   above the air and the clouds of earth's dreamland. Great polypous
   horrors slid darkly past, and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous
   around him, but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly
   and hippocephalic scaled bird. The stars danced mockingly, almost
   shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder
   one had not seen and feared before; and ever the winds of nether howled
   of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos.

   Then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent,
   and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away
   before the dawn. Trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made
   weirdly visible, there rose a timid hint of far-off melody, droning in
   faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not. And as that
   music grew, the Shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead, and Carter
   likewise bent to catch each lovely strain. It was a song, but not the
   song of any voice. Night and the spheres sang it, and it was old when
   space and Nyarlathotep and the Other Gods were born.

   Faster flew the Shantak, and lower bent the rider, drunk with the
   marvel of strange gulfs, and whirling in the crystal coils of outer
   magic. Then came too late the warning of the evil one, the sardonic
   caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the
   madness of that song. Only to taunt had Nyarlathotep marked out the way
   to safety and the marvellous sunset city; only to mock had that black
   messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose steps he could
   so easily lead back at will. For madness and the void's wild vengeance
   are Nyarlathotep's only gifts to the presumptuous; and frantick though
   the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed, that leering, tittering
   Shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless, flapping its great
   slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits
   whither no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nether-most
   confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinity's centre the
   mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud.

   Unswerving and obedient to the foul legate's orders, that hellish bird
   plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in
   darkness, and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped
   and groped and pawed; the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, that are
   like them blind and without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and
   thirsts

   Onward unswerving and relentless, and tittering hilariously to watch
   the chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the
   spheres had turned, that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless
   rider; hurtling and shooting, cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning
   the outermost abysses; leaving behind the stars and the realms of
   matter, and darting meteor-like through stark formlessness toward those
   inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time wherein Azathoth gnaws
   shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled, maddening beat of vile drums
   and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

   Onward--onward--through the screaming, cackling, and blackly populous
   gulfs--and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and
   a thought to Randolph Carter the doomed. Too well had Nyarlathotep
   planned his mocking and his tantalising, for he had brought up that
   which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface. Home--New
   England--Beacon Hill--the waking world.

   "For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum
   of what you have seen and loved in youth... the glory of Boston's
   hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset; of the
   flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
   gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles
   flows drowsily... this loveliness, moulded, crystallised, and polished
   by years of memory and dreaming, is your terraced wonder of elusive
   sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven
   rail, and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city
   of broad squares and prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back to
   the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood."

   Onward--onward--dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness
   where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless
   things tittered and tittered and tittered. But the image and the
   thought had come, and Randolph Carter knew clearly that he was dreaming
   and only dreaming, and that somewhere in the background the world of
   waking and the city of his infancy still lay. Words came again--"You
   need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful
   boyhood." Turn--turn--blackness on every side, but Randolph Carter
   could turn.

   Thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses, Randolph
   Carter could turn and move. He could move, and if he chose he could
   leap off the evil Shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the
   orders of Nyarlathotep. He could leap off and dare those depths of
   night that yawned interminably down, those depths of fear whose terrors
   yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos'
   core. He could turn and move and leap--he could--he would--he would--he
   would.

   Off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate
   dreamer, and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell.
   Aeons reeled, universes died and were born again, stars became nebulae
   and nebulae became stars, and still Randolph Carter fell through those
   endless voids of sentient blackness.

   Then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the
   cosmos churned itself into another futile completion, and all things
   became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before. Matter and light
   were born anew as space once had known them; and comets, suns and
   worlds sprang flaming into life, though nothing survived to tell that
   they had been and gone, been and gone, always and always, back to no
   first beginning.

   And there was a firmament again, and a wind, and a glare of purple
   light in the eyes of the falling dreamer. There were gods and presences
   and wills; beauty and evil, and the shrieking of noxious night robbed
   of its prey. For through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought
   and a vision of a dreamer's boyhood, and now there were remade a waking
   world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things.
   Out of the void S'ngac the violet gas had pointed the way, and archaic
   Nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps.

   Stars swelled to dawns, and dawns burst into fountains of gold,
   carmine, and purple, and still the dreamer fell. Cries rent the aether
   as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside. And hoary Nodens
   raised a howl of triumph when Nyarlathotep, close on his quarry,
   stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless hunting-horrors to
   grey dust. Randolph Carter had indeed descended at last the wide
   marmoreal flights to his marvellous city, for he was come again to the
   fair New England world that had wrought him.

   So to the organ chords of morning's myriad whistles, and dawn's blaze
   thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the
   State House on the hill, Randolph Carter leaped shoutingly awake within
   his Boston room. Birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of
   trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared.
   Beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and
   walls grotesquely figured, while a sleek black cat rose yawning from
   hearthside sleep that his master's start and shriek had disturbed. And
   vast infinities away, past the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted
   wood and the garden lands and the Cerenarian Sea and the twilight
   reaches of Inquanok, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep strode brooding
   into the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and taunted
   insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from
   their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city.

   Written in January/February 1932, it was first published in the July
   1933 issue of Weird Tales. An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia says that
   "The Dreams in the Witch House" was "heavily influenced by Nathaniel
   Hawthorne's unfinished novel Septimius Felton". -- Excerpted from The

   Whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the
   dreams Walter Gilman did not know. Behind everything crouched the
   brooding, festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy,
   unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with
   figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed.
   His ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable
   degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose
   ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night the
   subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of
   rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the
   centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident
   pandemonium. The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound--and yet
   he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside
   and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises which he suspected
   were lurking behind them.

   He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its
   clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches
   hid from the King's men in the dark, olden years of the Province. Nor
   was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable
   room which harboured him--for it was this house and this room which had
   likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at
   the last no one was ever able to explain. That was in 1692--the gaoler
   had gone mad and babbled of a small white-fanged furry thing which
   scuttled out of Keziah's cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain
   the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red,
   sticky fluid.

   Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean
   calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain, and when
   one mixes them with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background
   of multi-dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic
   tales and the wild whispers of the chimney-corner, one can hardly
   expect to be wholly free from mental tension. Gilman came from
   Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in Arkham that
   he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder
   magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his
   imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up,
   and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover,
   they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden
   secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university
   library. But all these precautions came late in the day, so that Gilman
   had some terrible hints from the dreaded Necronomicon of Abdul
   Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon, and the suppressed
   Unaussprechlicken Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract
   formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known
   and unknown.

   He knew his room was in the old Witch-House--that, indeed, was why he
   had taken it. There was much in the Essex County records about Keziah
   Mason's trial, and what she had admitted under pressure to the Court of
   Oyer and Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all reason. She had told
   Judge Hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out
   directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond,
   and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at
   certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond
   Meadow Hill and on the unpeopled island in the river. She had spoken
   also of the Black Man, of her oath, and of her new secret name of
   Nahab. Then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and
   vanished.

   Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer
   thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than
   two hundred and thirty-five years. When he heard the hushed Arkham
   whispers about Keziah's persistent presence in the old house and the
   narrow streets, about the irregular human tooth-marks left on certain
   sleepers in that and other houses, about the childish cries heard near
   May-Eve, and Hallowmass, about the stench often noted in the old
   house's attic just after those dreaded seasons, and about the small,
   furry, sharp-toothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and
   the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn,
   he resolved to live in the place at any cost. A room was easy to
   secure, for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over
   to cheap lodgings. Gilman could not have told what he expected to find
   there, but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some
   circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of
   the Seventeenth Century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps
   beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, and
   de Sitter.

   He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs
   at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week
   managed to get the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have
   practised her spells. It had been vacant from the first--for no one had
   ever been willing to stay there long--but the Polish landlord had grown
   wary about renting it. Yet nothing whatever happened to Gilman till
   about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah flitted through the
   sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his dismal
   eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch's incantations rewarded
   his constant search. Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy
   tangles of unpaved musty-smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of
   unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow,
   small-paned windows. Here he knew strange things had happened once, and
   there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that
   monstrous past might not--at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most
   intricately crooked alleys--have utterly perished. He also rowed out
   twice to the ill-regarded island in the river, and made a sketch of the
   singular angles described by the moss-grown rows of grey standing
   stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial.

   Gilman's room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north
   wall slating perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end, while
   the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction. Aside
   from an obvious rat-hole and the signs of other stopped-up ones, there
   was no access--nor any appearance of a former avenue of access--to the
   space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the
   straight outer wall on the house's north side, though a view from the
   exterior showed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote
   date. The loft above the ceiling--which must have had a slanting
   floor--was likewise inaccessible. When Gilman climbed up a ladder to
   the cob-webbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges
   of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking
   and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in Colonial carpentry. No
   amount of persuasion, however, could induce the stolid landlord to let
   him investigate either of these two closed spaces.

   As time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of
   his room increased; for he began to read into the odd angles a
   mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding
   their purpose. Old Keziah, he reflected, might have had excellent
   reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles; for was it not
   through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the
   boundaries of the world of space we know? His interest gradually veered
   away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it
   now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he
   was on.

   The touch of brain-fever and the dreams began early in February. For
   some time, apparently, the curious angles of Gilman's room had been
   having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak
   winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at
   the corner where the down-slanting ceiling met the inward-slanting
   wall. About this period his inability to concentrate on his formal
   studies worried him considerably, his apprehensions about the mid-year
   examinations being very acute. But the exaggerated sense of hearing was
   scarcely less annoying. Life had become an insistent and almost
   unendurable cacophony, and there was that constant, terrifying
   impression of other sounds--perhaps from regions beyond life--trembling
   on the very brink of audibility. So far as concrete noises went, the
   rats in the ancient partitions were the worst. Sometimes their
   scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate. When it came from
   beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry
   rattling; and when it came from the century-closed loft above the
   slanting ceiling Gilman always braced himself as if expecting some
   horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him
   utterly.

   The dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity, and Gilman fell that
   they must be a result, jointly, of his studies in mathematics and in
   folklore. He had been thinking too much about the vague regions which
   his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know, and
   about the possibility that old Keziah Mason--guided by some influence
   past all conjecture--had actually found the gate to those regions. The
   yellowed country records containing her testimony and that of her
   accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human
   experience--and the descriptions of the darting little furry object
   which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their
   incredible details.

   That object--no larger than a good-sized rat and quaintly called by the
   townspeople "Brown Jenkin"--seemed to have been the fruit of a
   remarkable case of sympathetic herd-delusion, for in 1692 no less than
   eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it. There were recent
   rumours, too, with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement.
   Witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat, but that its
   sharp-toothed, bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like
   tiny human hands. It took messages betwixt old Keziah and the devil,
   and was nursed on the witch's blood, which it sucked like a vampire.
   Its voice was a kind of loathsome titter, and it could speak all
   languages. Of all the bizarre monstrosities in Gilman's dreams, nothing
   filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and
   diminutive hybrid, whose image flitted across his vision in a form a
   thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking mind had deduced
   from the ancient records and the modern whispers.

   Gilman's dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses
   of inexplicably coloured twilight and baffingly disordered sound;
   abysses whose material and gravitational properties, and whose relation
   to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain. He did not walk
   or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode
   of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary. Of his own condition
   he could not well judge, for sight of his arms, legs, and torso seemed
   always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective; but he felt
   that his physical organization and faculties were somehow marvellously
   transmuted and obliquely projected--though not without a certain
   grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and properties.

   The abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably
   angled masses of alien-hued substance, some of which appeared to be
   organic while others seemed inorganic. A few of the organic objects
   tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind, though he could
   form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested.
   In the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into
   which the organic objects appeared to be divided, and which seemed to
   involve in each case a radically different species of conduct-pattern
   and basic motivation. Of these categories one seemed to him to include
   objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than
   the members of the other categories.

   All the objects--organic and inorganic alike--were totally beyond
   description or even comprehension. Gilman sometimes compared the
   inorganic matter to prisms, labyrinths, clusters of cubes and planes,
   and Cyclopean buildings; and the organic things struck him variously as
   groups of bubbles, octopi, centipedes, living Hindoo idols, and
   intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation.
   Everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and whenever
   one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him,
   he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake. Of
   how the organic entities moved, he could tell no more than of how he
   moved himself. In time he observed a further mystery--the tendency of
   certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space, or to disappear
   totally with equal suddenness. The shrieking, roaring confusion of
   sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch,
   timbre or rhythm; but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual
   changes in all the indefinite objects, organic and inorganic alike.
   Gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some
   unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure,
   relentlessly inevitable fluctuations.

   But it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw Brown
   Jenkin. That shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter,
   sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the
   fullest depths of sleep. He would be lying in the dark fighting to keep
   awake when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the
   centuried room, showing in a violet mist the convergence of angled
   planes which had seized his brain so insidiously. The horror would
   appear to pop out of the rat-hole in the corner and patter toward him
   over the sagging, wide-planked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny,
   bearded human face; but mercifully, this dream always melted away
   before the object got close enough to nuzzle him. It had hellishly
   long, sharp, canine teeth; Gilman tried to stop up the rat-hole every
   day, but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away
   the obstruction, whatever it might be. Once he had the landlord nail a
   tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole, in making
   which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little
   fragment of bone.

   Gilman did not report his fever to the doctor, for he knew he could not
   pass the examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every
   moment was needed for cramming. As it was, he failed in Calculus D and
   Advanced General Psychology, though not without hope of making up lost
   ground before the end of the term.

   It was in March when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary
   dreaming, and the nightmare shape of Brown Jenkin began to be
   companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a
   bent old woman. This addition disturbed him more than he could account
   for, but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he
   had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the
   abandoned wharves. On those occasions the evil, sardonic, and seemingly
   unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost
   shivering--especially the first time when an overgrown rat darting
   across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think
   irrationally of Brown Jenkin. Now, he reflected, those nervous fears
   were being mirrored in his disordered dreams. That the influence of the
   old house was unwholesome he could not deny, but traces of his early
   morbid interest still held him there. He argued that the fever alone
   was responsible for his nightly fantasies, and that when the touch
   abated he would be free from the monstrous visions. Those visions,
   however, were of absorbing vividness and convincingness, and whenever
   he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than
   he remembered. He was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had
   talked with both Brown Jenkin and the old woman, and that they had been
   urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of
   greater potency.

   Toward the end of March he began to pick up in his mathematics, though
   the other studies bothered him increasingly. He was getting an
   intuitive knack for solving Riemannian equations, and astonished
   Professor Upham by his comprehension of fourth-dimensional and other
   problems which had floored all the rest of the class. One afternoon
   there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of
   theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the
   cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or
   the transgalactic gulfs themselves--or even as fabulously remote as the
   tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian
   space-time continuum. Gilman's handling of this theme filled everyone
   with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations
   caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and
   solitary eccentricity. What made the students shake their heads was his
   sober theory that a man might--given mathematical knowledge admittedly
   beyond all likelihood of human acquirement--step deliberately from the
   earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity
   of specific points in the cosmic pattern.

   Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage
   out of the three-dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back
   to the three-dimensional sphere at another point, perhaps one of
   infinite remoteness. That this could be accomplished without loss of
   life was in many cases conceivable. Any being from any part of
   three-dimensional space could probably survive in the fourth dimension;
   and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part
   of three-dimensional space it might select for its re-entry. Denizens
   of some planets might be able to live on certain others--even planets
   belonging to other galaxies, or to similar dimensional phases of other
   space-time continua--though of course there must be vast numbers of
   mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or
   zones of space.

   It was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm
   could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of
   additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensions--be they within or
   outside the given space-time continuum--and that the converse would be
   likewise true. This was a matter for speculation, though one could be
   fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any
   given dimensional plane to the next higher one would not be destructive
   of biological integrity as we understand it. Gilman could not be very
   clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here
   was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points.
   Professor Upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of
   higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down
   the ages from an ineffable antiquity--human or pre-human--whose
   knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours.

   Around 1 April Gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did
   not abate. He was also troubled by what some of his fellow lodgers said
   about his sleep-walking. It seemed that he was often absent from his
   bed and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night
   was remarked by the man in the room below. This fellow also spoke of
   hearing the tread of shod feet in the night; but Gilman was sure he
   must have been mistaken in this, since shoes as well as other apparel
   were always precisely in place in the morning. One could develop all
   sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old house--for did not Gilman
   himself, even in daylight, now feel certain that noises other than
   rat-scratching came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and
   above the slanting ceiling? His pathologically sensitive ears began to
   listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead,
   and sometimes the illusion of such things was agonizingly realistic.

   However, he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist; for twice
   at night his room had been found vacant, though with all his clothing
   in place. Of this he had been assured by Frank Elwood, the one
   fellow-student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and
   unpopular house. Elwood had been studying in the small hours and had
   come up for help on a differential equation, only to find Gilman
   absent. It had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked
   door after knocking had failed to rouse a response, but he had needed
   the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle
   prodding awake. On neither occasion, though, had Gilman been there; and
   when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering,
   barefoot and with only his night clothes on. He resolved to investigate
   the matter if reports of his sleep-walking continued, and thought of
   sprinkling flour on the floor of the corridor to see where his
   footsteps might lead. The door was the only conceivable egress, for
   there was no possible foothold outside the narrow window.

   As April advanced, Gilman's fever-sharpened ears were disturbed by the
   whining prayers of a superstitious loom-fixer named Joe Mazurewicz who
   had a room on the ground floor. Mazurewicz had told long, rambling
   stories about the ghost of old Keziah and the furry sharp-fanged,
   nuzzling thing, and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only
   his silver crucifix--given him for the purpose by Father Iwanicki of
   St. Stanislaus' Church--could bring him relief. Now he was praying
   because the Witches' Sabbath was drawing near. May Eve was Walpurgis
   Night, when hell's blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of
   Satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds. It was always a very bad
   time in Arkham, even though the fine folks up in Miskatonic Avenue and
   High and Saltonstall Streets pretended to know nothing about it. There
   would be bad doings, and a child or two would probably be missing. Joe
   knew about such things, for his grandmother in the old country had
   heard tales from her grandmother. It was wise to pray and count one's
   beads at this season. For three months Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not
   been near Joe's room, nor near Paul Choynski's room, nor anywhere
   else--and it meant no good when they held off like that. They must be
   up to something.

   Gilman dropped in at the doctor's office on the sixteenth of the month,
   and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had
   feared. The physician questioned him sharply, and advised him to see a
   nerve specialist. On reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the
   still more inquisitive college doctor. Old Waldron, who had curtailed
   his activities before, would have made him take a rest--an impossible
   thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations. He
   was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the
   fourth dimension, and who could say how much farther he might go?

   But even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his
   strange confidence. Did all of this perilous sense of imminence come
   from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day? The soft,
   stealthy, imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving.
   And now, too, there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly
   persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do. How
   about the somnambulism? Where did he go sometimes in the night? And
   what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while seemed to
   trickle through the confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad
   daylight and full wakefulness? Its rhythm did not correspond to
   anything on earth, unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two
   unmentionable Sabbat-chants, and sometimes he feared it corresponded to
   certain attributes of the vague shrieking or roaring in those wholly
   alien abysses of dream.

   The dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious. In the lighter
   preliminary phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness,
   and Gilman knew she was the one who had frightened him in the slums.
   Her bent back, long nose, and shrivelled chin were unmistakable, and
   her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered. The
   expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation,
   and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and
   threatened. He must meet the Black Man and go with them all to the
   throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos. That was what she
   said. He must sign the book of Azathoth in his own blood and take a new
   secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far. What
   kept him from going with her and Brown Jenkin and the other to the
   throne of Chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that
   he had seen the name "Azathoth" in the Necronomicon, and knew it stood
   for a primal evil too horrible for description.

   The old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the
   downward slant met the inward slant. She seemed to crystallize at a
   point closer to the ceiling than to the floor, and every night she was
   a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted. Brown
   Jenkin, too, was always a little nearer at the last, and its
   yellowish-white fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet
   phosphorescence. Its shrill loathsome tittering struck more and more
   into Gilman's head, and he could remember in the morning how it had
   pronounced the words "Azathoth" and "Nyarlathotep".

   In the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and Gilman
   felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth
   dimension. Those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly
   irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of life-forms from
   our own planet, including human beings. What the others were in their
   own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think. Two of the
   less irrelevantly moving things--a rather large congeries of
   iridescent, prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller
   polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface
   angles--seemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float
   ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms, labyrinths,
   cube-and-plane clusters and quasi-buildings; and all the while the
   vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder, as if approaching
   some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensity.

   During the night of 19-20 April the new development occurred. Gilman
   was half involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the
   bubble-mass and the small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the
   peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic
   neighbouring prism-clusters. In another second he was out of the abyss
   and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense,
   diffused green light. He was barefooted and in his nightclothes, and
   when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet.
   A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from
   sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds, that might surge
   out of that vapour.

   Then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward him--the old
   woman and the little furry thing. The crone strained up to her knees
   and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion, while Brown Jenkin
   pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid forepaw which
   it raised with evident difficulty. Spurred by an impulse he did not
   originate, Gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by
   the angle of the old woman's arms and the direction of the small
   monstrosity's paw, and before he had shuffled three steps he was back
   in the twilight abysses. Geometrical shapes seethed around him, and he
   fell dizzily and interminably. At last he woke in his bed in the
   crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house.

   He was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his
   classes. Some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly
   irrelevant direction, for he could not help staring at a certain vacant
   spot on the floor. As the day advanced, the focus of his unseeing eyes
   changed position, and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at
   vacancy. About two o'clock he went out for lunch and as he threaded the
   narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the
   southeast. Only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in Church Street,
   and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly.

   He would have to consult a nerve specialist after all--perhaps there
   was a connection with his somnambulism--but meanwhile he might at least
   try to break the morbid spell himself. Undoubtedly he could still
   manage to walk away from the pull, so with great resolution he headed
   against it and dragged himself deliberately north along Garrison
   Street. By the time he had reached the bridge over the Miskatonic he
   was in a cold perspiration, and he clutched at the iron railing as he
   gazed upstream at the ill-regarded island whose regular lines of
   ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlight.

   Then he gave a start. For there was a clearly visible living figure on
   that desolate island, and a second glance told him it was certainly the
   strange old woman whose sinister aspect had worked itself so
   disastrously into his dreams. The tall grass near her was moving, too,
   as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground. When
   the old woman began to turn toward him he fled precipitately off the
   bridge and into the shelter of the town's labyrinthine waterfront
   alleys. Distant though the island was, he felt that a monstrous and
   invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent,
   ancient figure in brown.

   The southeastwards pull still held, and only with tremendous resolution
   could Gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs.
   For hours he sat silent and aimless, with his eyes shifting gradually
   westward. About six o'clock his sharpened ears caught the whining
   prayers of Joe Mazurewicz two floors below, and in desperation he
   seized his hat and walked out into the sunset-golden streets, letting
   the now directly southward pull carry him where it might. An hour later
   darkness found him in the open fields beyond Hangman's Brook, with the
   glimmering spring stars shining ahead. The urge to walk was gradually
   changing to an urge to leap mystically into space, and suddenly he
   realized just where the source of the pull lay.

   It was in the sky. A definite point among the stars had a claim on him
   and was calling him. Apparently it was a point somewhere between Hydra
   and Argo Navis, and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since
   he had awaked soon after dawn. In the morning it had been underfoot,
   and now it was roughly south but stealing toward the west. What was the
   meaning of this new thing? Was he going mad? How long would it last?
   Again mustering his resolution, Gilman turned and dragged himself back
   to the sinister old house.

   Mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door, and seemed both anxious and
   reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition. It was about the
   witch-light. Joe had been out celebrating the night before--and it was
   Patriots' Day in Massachusetts--and had come home after midnight.
   Looking up at the house from outside, he had thought at first that
   Gilman's window was dark, but then he had seen the faint violet glow
   within. He wanted to warn the gentleman about that glow, for everybody
   in Arkham knew it was Keziah's witch-light which played near Brown
   Jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself. He had not mentioned
   this before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that Keziah
   and her long-toothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman.
   Sometimes he and Paul Choynski and Landlord Dombrowski thought they saw
   that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young
   gentleman's room, but they had all agreed not to talk about that.
   However, it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and
   get a crucifix from some good priest like Father Iwanicki.

   As the man rambled on, Gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his
   throat. He knew that Joe must have been half drunk when he came home
   the night before; yet the mention of a violet light in the garret
   window was of frightful import. It was a lambent glow of this sort
   which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in
   those lighter, sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown
   abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the
   dream-luminance was utterly beyond sane harborage. Yet where had the
   fellow got such an odd notion? Had he himself talked as well as walked
   around the house in his sleep? No, Joe said, he had not--but he must
   check up on this. Perhaps Frank Elwood could tell him something, though
   he hated to ask.

   Fever--wild dreams--somnambulism--illusions of sounds--a pull toward a
   point in the sky--and now a suspicion of insane sleep-talking! He must
   stop studying, see a nerve specialist, and take himself in hand. When
   he climbed to the second storey he paused at Elwood's door but saw that
   the other youth was out. Reluctantly he continued up to his garret room
   and sat down in the dark. His gaze was still pulled to the southward,
   but he also found himself listening intently for some sound in the
   closed loft above, and half imagining that an evil violet light seeped
   down through an infinitesimal crack in the low, slanting ceiling.

   That night as Gilman slept, the violet light broke upon him with
   heightened intensity, and the old witch and small furry thing, getting
   closer than ever before, mocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish
   gestures. He was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight
   abysses, though the pursuit of that iridescent bubble-congeries and
   that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and irritating. Then
   came the shift as vast converging planes of a slippery-looking
   substance loomed above and below him--a shift which ended in a flash of
   delirium and a blaze of unknown, alien light in which yellow, carmine,
   and indigo were madly and inextricably blended.

   He was half lying on a high, fantastically balustraded terrace above a
   boundless jungle of outlandish, incredible peaks, balanced planes,
   domes, minarets, horizontal disks poised on pinnacles, and numberless
   forms of still greater wildness--some of stone and some of metal--which
   glittered gorgeously in the mixed, almost blistering glare from a
   poly-chromatic sky. Looking upward he saw three stupendous disks of
   flame, each of a different hue, and at a different height above an
   infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains. Behind him tiers
   of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see. The city below
   stretched away to the limits of vision, and he hoped that no sound
   would well up from it.

   The pavement from which he easily raised himself was a veined polished
   stone beyond his power to identify, and the tiles were cut in
   bizarre-angled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based
   on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend. The
   balustrade was chest-high, delicate, and fantastically wrought, while
   along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of
   grotesque design and exquisite workmanship. They, like the whole
   balustrade, seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose
   colour could not be guessed in the chaos of mixed effulgences, and
   their nature utterly defied conjecture. They represented some ridged
   barrel-shaped objects with thin horizontal arms radiating spoke-like
   from a central ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from
   the head and base of the barrel. Each of these knobs was the hub of a
   system of five long, flat, triangularly tapering arms arranged around
   it like the arms of a starfish--nearly horizontal, but curving slightly
   away from the central barrel. The base of the bottom knob was fused to
   the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several
   figures had been broken off and were missing. The figures were about
   four and a half inches in height, while the spiky arms gave them a
   maximum diameter of about two and a half inches.

   When Gilman stood up, the tiles felt hot to his bare feet. He was
   wholly alone, and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look
   dizzily down at the endless, Cyclopean city almost two thousand feet
   below. As he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical
   pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets
   beneath, and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place. The
   sight turned him giddy after a while, so that he would have fallen to
   the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous
   balustrade. His right hand fell on one of the projecting figures, the
   touch seeming to steady him slightly. It was too much, however, for the
   exotic delicacy of the metal-work, and the spiky figure snapped off
   under his grasp. Still half dazed, he continued to clutch it as his
   other hand seized a vacant space on the smooth railing.

   But now his over-sensitive ears caught something behind him, and he
   looked back across the level terrace. Approaching him softly though
   without apparent furtiveness were five figures, two of which were the
   sinister old woman and the fanged, furry little animal. The other three
   were what sent him unconscious; for they were living entities about
   eight feet high, shaped precisely like the spiky images on the
   balustrade, and propelling themselves by a spider-like wriggling of
   their lower set of starfish-arms.

   Gilman awoke in his bed, drenched by a cold perspiration and with a
   smarting sensation in his face, hands and feet. Springing to the floor,
   he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him
   to get out of the house as quickly as possible. He did not know where
   he wished to go, but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his
   classes. The odd pull toward that spot in the sky between Hydra and
   Argo had abated, but another of even greater strength had taken its
   place. Now he felt that he must go north--infinitely north. He dreaded
   to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the
   Miskatonic, so went over the Peabody Avenue bridge. Very often he
   stumbled, for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty
   point in the blank blue sky.

   After about an hour he got himself under better control, and saw that
   he was far from the city. All around him stretched the bleak emptiness
   of salt marshes, while the narrow road ahead led to Innsmouth--that
   ancient, half-deserted town which Arkham people were so curiously
   unwilling to visit. Though the northward pull had not diminished, he
   resisted it as he had resisted the other pull, and finally found that
   he could almost balance the one against the other. Plodding back to
   town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain, he dragged himself
   into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter
   magazines. Once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he
   looked, but he did not tell them of his walk. At three o'clock he took
   some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either
   lessened or divided itself. After that he killed the time at a cheap
   cinema show, seeing the inane performance over and over again without
   paying any attention to it.

   About nine at night he drifted homeward and shuffled into the ancient
   house. Joe Mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers, and Gilman
   hastened up to his own garret chamber without pausing to see if Elwood
   was in. It was when he turned on the feeble electric light that the
   shock came. At once he saw there was something on the table which did
   not belong there, and a second look left no room for doubt. Lying on
   its side--for it could not stand up alone--was the exotic spiky figure
   which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic
   balustrade. No detail was missing. The ridged, barrel-shaped center,
   the thin radiating arms, the knobs at each end, and the flat, slightly
   outward-curving starfish-arms spreading from those knobs--all were
   there. In the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of
   iridescent grey veined with green; and Gilman could see amidst his
   horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break,
   corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dream-railing.

   Only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming
   aloud. This fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear. Still
   dazed, he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to
   Landlord Dombrowski's quarters. The whining prayers of the
   superstitious loom-fixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls,
   but Gilman did not mind them now. The landlord was in, and greeted him
   pleasantly. No, he had not seen that thing before and did not know
   anything about it. But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in
   one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was
   it. Dombrowski called her, and she waddled in. Yes, that was the thing.
   She had found it in the young gentleman's bed--on the side next the
   wall. It had looked very queer to her, but of course the young
   gentleman had lots of queer things in his room--books and curios and
   pictures and markings on paper. She certainly knew nothing about it.

   So Gilman climbed upstairs again in mental turmoil, convinced that he
   was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to
   incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places.
   Where had he got this outré thing? He did not recall seeing it in any
   museum in Arkham. It must have been somewhere, though; and the sight of
   it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd
   dream-picture of the balustraded terrace. Next day he would make some
   very guarded inquiries--and perhaps see the nerve specialist.

   Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism. As he went
   upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which
   he had borrowed--with a frank admission as to its purpose--from the
   landlord. He had stopped at Elwood's door on the way, but had found all
   dark within. Entering his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table,
   and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing
   to undress. From the closed loft above the slating ceiling he thought
   he heard a faint scratching and padding, but he was too disorganized
   even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was getting very
   strong again, though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the
   sky.

   In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged,
   furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any
   former occasion. This time they actually reached him, and he felt the
   crone's withered claws clutching at him. He was pulled out of bed and
   into empty space, and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw
   the twilight amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him.
   But that moment was very brief, for presently he was in a crude,
   windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a peak
   just above his head, and with a curious slanting floor underfoot.
   Propped level on that floor were low cases full of books of every
   degree of antiquity and disintegration, and in the centre were a table
   and bench, both apparently fastened in place. Small objects of unknown
   shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases, and in the
   flaming violet light Gilman thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky
   image which had puzzled him so horribly. On the left the floor fell
   abruptly away, leaving a black triangular gulf out of which, after a
   second's dry rattling, there presently climbed the hateful little furry
   thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human face.

   The evilly-grinning beldame still clutched him, and beyond the table
   stood a figure he had never seen before--a tall, lean man of dead black
   colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features: wholly
   devoid of either hair or beard, and wearing as his only garment a
   shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric. His feet were
   indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been
   shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position. The man
   did not speak, and bore no trace of expression on his small, regular
   features. He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open
   on the table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman's
   right hand. Over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear, and
   the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamer's
   clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm, finally biting
   him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff. As the blood spurted from
   this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint.

   He awaked on the morning of the twenty-second with a pain in his left
   wrist, and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood. His
   recollections were very confused, but the scene with the black man in
   the unknown space stood out vividly. The rats must have bitten him as
   he slept, giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream. Opening
   the door, he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed
   except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the
   other end of the garret. So he had not been sleep-walking this time.
   But something would have to be done about those rats. He would speak to
   the landlord about them. Again he tried to stop up the hole at the base
   of the slanting wall, wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about
   the right size. His ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual
   echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams.

   As he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed
   after the scene in the violet-litten space, but nothing definite would
   crystallize in his mind. That scene itself must have corresponded to
   the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so
   violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy. There were
   suggestions of the vague, twilight abysses, and of still vaster,
   blacker abysses beyond them--abysses in which all fixed suggestions
   were absent. He had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the
   little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had
   changed to wisps of mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness.
   Something else had gone on ahead--a larger wisp which now and then
   condensed into nameless approximations of form--and he thought that
   their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the
   alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws
   unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos.
   Eventually there had been a hint of vast, leaping shadows, of a
   monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous piping of
   an unseen flute--but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up that
   last conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the
   mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a black
   throne at the centre of Chaos.

   When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and
   Gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred
   to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had
   lain--which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and
   cuff. Had he been sleep-walking within his room, and had the rat bitten
   him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position?
   He looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains, but did not
   find any. He had better, he thought, spinkle flour within the room as
   well as outside the door--though after all no further proof of his
   sleep-walking was needed. He knew he did walk and the thing to do now
   was to stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the
   strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by
   another sensation even more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent
   impulse to fly away from his present situation, but held not a hint of
   the specific direction in which he wished to fly. As he picked up the
   strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull
   grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the
   newer and more bewildering urge.

   He took the spiky image down to Elwood's room, steeling himself against
   the whines of the loom-fixer which welled up from the ground floor.
   Elwood was in, thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There
   was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and
   college, so Gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent
   dreams and fears. His host was very sympathetic, and agreed that
   something ought to be done. He was shocked by his guest's drawn,
   haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking sunburn which
   others had remarked during the past week.

   There was not much, though, that he could say. He had not seen Gilman
   on any sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious image
   could be. He had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just
   under Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each
   other how badly they dreaded the coming of Walpurgis Night, now only a
   few days off; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor,
   doomed young gentleman. Desrochers, the fellow under Gilman's room, had
   spoken of nocturnal footsteps shod and unshod, and of the violet light
   he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through
   Gilman's keyhole. He had not dared to peer, he told Mazurewicz, after
   he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door. There
   had been soft talking, too--and as he began to describe it his voice
   had sunk to an inaudible whisper.

   Elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures
   gossiping, but supposed their imaginations had been roused by Gilman's
   late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand, and by
   the nearness of traditionally-feared May Eve on the other hand. That
   Gilman talked in his sleep was plain, and it was obviously from
   Desrochers' keyhole listenings that the delusive notion of the violet
   dream-light had got abroad. These simple people were quick to imagine
   they had seen any odd thing they had heard about. As for a plan of
   action--Gilman had better move down to Elwood's room and avoid sleeping
   alone. Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or
   rise in his sleep. Very soon, too, he must see the specialist.
   Meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums
   and to certain professors; seeking identification and stating that it
   had been found in a public rubbish-can. Also, Dombrowski must attend to
   the poisoning of those rats in the walls.

   Braced up by Elwood's companionship, Gilman attended classes that day.
   Strange urges still tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with
   considerable success. During a free period he showed the queer image to
   several professors, all of whom were intensely interested, though none
   of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin. That night he
   slept on a couch which Elwood had had the landlord bring to the
   second-storey room, and for the first time in weeks was wholly free
   from disquieting dreams. But the feverishness still hung on, and the
   whines of the loom-fixer were an unnerving influence.

   During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from
   morbid manifestations. He had, Elwood said, showed no tendency to talk
   or rise in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting rat-poison
   everywhere. The only disturbing element was the talk among the
   superstitious foreigners, whose imaginations had become highly excited.
   Mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix, and finally
   forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good Father
   Iwanicki. Desrochers, too, had something to say; in fact, he insisted
   that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the
   first and second nights of Gilinan's absence from it. Paul Choynski
   thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night, and
   claimed that his door had been softly tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski
   vowed she had seen Brown Jenkin for the first time since All-Hallows.
   But such naïve reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap
   metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his host's dresser.

   For three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an
   effort to identify the strange spiky image, but always without success.
   In every quarter, however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage
   of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity. One of
   the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical
   analysis. Professor Ellery found platinum, iron and tellurium in the
   strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent
   elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless
   to classify. Not only did they fail to correspond with any known
   element, but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for
   probable elements in the periodic system. The mystery remains unsolved
   to this day, though the image is on exhibition at the museum of
   Miskatonic University.

   On the morning of April twenty-seventh a fresh rat-hole appeared in the
   room where Gilman was a guest, but Dombrowski tinned it up during the
   day. The poison was not having much effect, for scratchings and
   scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished.

   Elwood was out late that night, and Gilman waited up for him. He did
   not wish to go to sleep in a room alone--especially since he thought he
   had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose
   image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams. He wondered who
   she was, and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a
   rubbish-heap at the mouth of a squalid courtyard. The crone had seemed
   to notice him and leer evilly at him--though perhaps this was merely
   his imagination.

   The next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep
   like logs when night came. In the evening they drowsily discussed the
   mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully
   engrossed Gilman, and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic
   and folklore which seemed so darkly probable. They spoke of old Keziah
   Mason, and Elwood agreed that Gilman had good scientific grounds for
   thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant
   information. The hidden cults to which these witches belonged often
   guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder, forgotten eons;
   and it was by no means impossible that Keziah had actually mastered the
   art of passing through dimensional gates. Tradition emphasizes the
   uselessness of material barriers in halting a witch's notions, and who
   can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the
   night?

   Whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from
   mathematical research alone, was still to be seen. Success, Gilman
   added, might lead to dangerous and unthinkable situations, for who
   could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally
   inaccessible dimension? On the other hand, the picturesque
   possibilities were enormous. Time could not exist in certain belts of
   space, and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve
   one's life and age indefinitely; never suffering organic metabolism or
   deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to one's
   own or similar planes. One might, for example, pass into a timeless
   dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earth's history as
   young as before.

   Whether anybody had ever managed to do this, one could hardly
   conjecture with any degree of authority. Old legends are hazy and
   ambiguous, and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden
   gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and
   messengers from outside. There was the immemorial figure of the deputy
   or messenger of hidden and terrible powers--the "Black Man" of the
   witch-cult, and the "Nyarlathotep" of the Necronomicon. There was, too,
   the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediaries--the
   quasi-animals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches'
   familiars. As Gilman and Elwood retired, too sleepy to argue further,
   they heard Joe Mazurewicz reel into the house half drunk, and shuddered
   at the desperate wildness of his whining prayers.

   That night Gilman saw the violet light again. In his dream he had heard
   a scratching and gnawing in the partitions, and thought that someone
   fumbled clumsily at the latch. Then he saw the old woman and the small
   furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor. The beldame's
   face was alight with inhuman exultation, and the little yellow-toothed
   morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavily-sleeping form
   of Elwood on the other couch across the room. A paralysis of fear
   stifled all attempts to cry out. As once before, the hideous crone
   seized Gilman by the shoulders, yanking him out of bed and into empty
   space. Again the infinitude of the shrieking abysses flashed past him,
   but in another second he thought he was in a dark, muddy, unknown alley
   of foetid odors with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on
   every hand.

   Ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the
   other dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning
   and grimacing imperiously. Brown Jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind
   of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man, which
   the deep mud largely concealed. There was a dark open doorway on the
   right, to which the black man silently pointed. Into this the grinning
   crone started, dragging Gilman after her by his pajama sleeves. There
   were evil-smelling staircases which creaked ominously, and on which the
   old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light; and finally a door
   leading off a landing. The crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the
   door open, motioning to Gilman to wait, and disappearing inside the
   black aperture.

   The youth's over-sensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry, and
   presently the beldame came out of the room bearing a small, senseless
   form which she thrust at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it.
   The sight of this form, and the expression on its face, broke the
   spell. Still too dazed to cry out, he plunged recklessly down the
   noisome staircase and into the mud outside, halting only when seized
   and choked by the waiting black man. As consciousness departed he heard
   the faint, shrill tittering of the fanged, rat-like abnormality.

   On the morning of the twenty-ninth Gilman awaked into a maelstrom of
   horror. The instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly
   wrong, for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall
   and ceiling, sprawled on the now unmade bed. His throat was aching
   inexplicably, and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with
   growing fright that his feet and pajama bottoms were brown with caked
   mud. For the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew
   at least that he must have been sleep-walking. Elwood had been lost too
   deeply in slumber to hear and stop him. On the floor were confused
   muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the
   door. The more Gilman looked at them, the more peculiar they seemed;
   for in addition to those he could recognize as his there were some
   smaller, almost round markings--such as the legs of a large chair or a
   table might make, except that most of them tended to be divided into
   halves. There were also some curious muddy rat-tracks leading out of a
   fresh hole and back into it again. Utter bewilderment and the fear of
   madness racked Gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there
   were no muddy prints outside. The more he remembered of his hideous
   dream the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to
   hear Joe Mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below.

   Descending to Elwood's room he roused his still-sleeping host and began
   telling of how he had found himself, but Elwood could form no idea of
   what might really have happened. Where Gilman could have been, how he
   got back to his room without making tracks in the hall, and how the
   muddy, furniture-like prints came to be mixed with his in the garret
   chamber, were wholly beyond conjecture. Then there were those dark,
   livid marks on his throat, as if he had tried to strangle himself. He
   put his hands up to them, but found that they did not even
   approximately fit. While they were talking, Desrochers dropped in to
   say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small
   hours. No, there had been no one on the stairs after midnight, though
   just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret, and
   cautiously descending steps he did not like. It was, he added, a very
   bad time of year for Arkham. The young gentleman had better be sure to
   wear the crucifix Joe Mazurewicz had given him. Even the daytime was
   not safe, for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the
   house--especially a thin, childish wail hastily choked off.

   Gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly
   unable to fix his mind on his studies. A mood of hideous apprehension
   and expectancy had seized him, and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of
   some annihilating blow. At noon he lunched at the University spa,
   picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert. But he
   never ate that dessert; for an item on the paper's first page left him
   limp, wild-eyed, and able only to pay his check and stagger back to
   Elwood's room.

   There had been a strange kidnapping the night before in Orne's Gangway,
   and the two-year-old child of a clod-like laundry worker named
   Anastasia Wolejko had completely vanished from sight. The mother, it
   appeared, had feared the event for some time; but the reasons she
   assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them
   seriously. She had, she said, seen Brown Jenkin about the place now and
   then ever since early in March, and knew from its grimaces and
   titterings that little Ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the
   awful Sabbat on Walpurgis Night. She had asked her neighbour Mary
   Czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child, but Mary had
   not dared. She could not tell the police, for they never believed such
   things. Children had been taken that way every year ever since she
   could remember. And her friend Pete Stowacki would not help because he
   wanted the child out of the way.

   But what threw Gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair
   of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just
   after midnight. They admitted they had been drunk, but both vowed they
   had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway.
   There had, they said, been a huge robed negro, a little old woman in
   rags, and a young white man in his night-clothes. The old woman had
   been dragging the youth, while around the feet of the negro a tame rat
   was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud.

   Gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and Elwood--who had meanwhile
   seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them--found him
   thus when he came home. This time neither could doubt but that
   something hideously serious was closing in around them. Between the
   phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a
   monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallizing, and only
   stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments.
   Gilman must see a specialist sooner or later, but not just now, when
   all the papers were full of this kidnapping business.

   Just what had really happened was maddeningly obscure, and for a moment
   both Gilman and Elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest
   kind. Had Gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his
   studies of space and its dimensions? Had he actually slipped outside
   our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable? Where--if
   anywhere--had he been on those nights of demoniac alienage? The roaring
   twilight abysses--the green hillside--the blistering terrace--the pulls
   from the stars--the ultimate black vortex--the black man--the muddy
   alley and the stairs--the old witch and the fanged, furry horror--the
   bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron--the strange sunburn--the
   wrist-wound--the unexplained image--the muddy feet--the throat
   marks--the tales and fears of the superstitious foreigners--what did
   all this mean? To what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a
   case?

   There was no sleep for either of them that night, but next day they
   both cut classes and drowsed. This was April thirtieth, and with the
   dusk would come the hellish Sabbat-time which all the foreigners and
   the superstitious old folk feared. Mazurewicz came home at six o'clock
   and said people at the mill were whispering that the Walpurgis revels
   would be held in the dark ravine beyond Meadow Hill where the old white
   stone stands in a place queerly devoid of all plant-life. Some of them
   had even told the police and advised them to look there for the missing
   Wolejko child, but they did not believe anything would be done. Joe
   insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his nickel-chained
   crucifix, and Gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to
   humour the fellow.

   Late at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs, lulled by
   the praying of the loom-fixer on the floor below. Gilman listened as he
   nodded, his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for
   some subtle, dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house.
   Unwholesome recollections of things in the Necronomicon and the Black
   Book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said
   to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the Sabbat and to have an
   origin outside the time and space we comprehend.

   Presently he realized what he was listening for--the hellish chant of
   the celebrants in the distant black valley. How did he know so much
   about what they expected? How did he know the time when Nahab and her
   acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black
   cock and the black goat? He saw that Elwood had dropped asleep, and
   tried to call out and waken him. Something, however, closed his throat.
   He was not his own master. Had he signed the black man's book after
   all?

   Then his fevered, abnormal hearing caught the distant, windborne notes.
   Over miles of hill and field and alley they came, but he recognized
   them none the less. The fires must be lit, and the dancers must be
   starting in. How could he keep himself from going? What was it that had
   enmeshed him? Mathematics--folklore--the house--old Keziah--Brown
   Jenkin ... and now he saw that there was a fresh rat-hole in the wall
   near his couch. Above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of
   Joe Mazurewicz came another sound--a stealthy, determined scratching in
   the partitions. He hoped the electric lights would not go out. Then he
   saw the fanged, bearded little face in the rat-hole--the accursed
   little face which he at last realized bore such a shocking, mocking
   resemblance to old Keziah's--and heard the faint fumbling at the door.

   The screaming twilight abysses flashed before him, and he felt himself
   helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubble-congeries.
   Ahead raced the small, kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the
   churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague
   tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and
   unendurable climax. He seemed to know what was coming--the monstrous
   burst of Walpurgis-rhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated
   all the primal, ultimate space-time seethings which lie behind the
   massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured
   reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give
   hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods.

   But all this vanished in a second. He was again in the cramped,
   violet-litten peaked space with the slanting floor, the low cases of
   ancient books, the bench and table, the queer objects, and the
   triangular gulf at one side. On the table lay a small white figure--an
   infant boy, unclothed and unconscious--while on the other side stood
   the monstrous, leering old woman with a gleaming, grotesque-hafted
   knife in her right hand, and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl
   covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral
   handles in her left. She was intoning some croaking ritual in a
   language which Gilman could not understand, but which seemed like
   something guardedly quoted in the Necronomicon.

   As the scene grew clearer he saw the ancient crone bend forward and
   extend the empty bowl across the table--and unable to control his own
   emotions, he reached far forward and took it in both hands, noticing as
   he did so its comparative lightness. At the same moment the disgusting
   form of Brown Jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular
   black gulf on his left. The crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in
   a certain position while she raised the huge, grotesque knife above the
   small white victim as high as her right hand could reach. The fanged,
   furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual, while
   the witch croaked loathsome responses. Gilman felt a gnawing poignant
   abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis, and the
   light metal bowl shook in his grasp. A second later the downward motion
   of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a
   resounding bell-like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to
   stop the monstrous deed.

   In an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the
   table and wrenched the knife from the old woman's claws; sending it
   clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf. In another
   instant, however, matters were reversed; for those murderous claws had
   locked themselves tightly around his own throat, while the wrinkled
   face was twisted with insane fury. He felt the chain of the cheap
   crucifix grinding into his neck, and in his peril wondered how the
   sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature. Her strength
   was altogether superhuman, but as she continued her choking he reached
   feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol, snapping the chain
   and pulling it free.

   At sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic, and her grip
   relaxed long enough to give Gilman a chance to break it entirely. He
   pulled the steel-like claws from his neck, and would have dragged the
   beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh
   access of strength and closed in again. This time he resolved to reply
   in kind, and his own hands reached out for the creature's throat.
   Before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix
   twisted about her neck, and a moment later he had tightened it enough
   to cut off her breath. During her last struggle he felt something bite
   at his ankle, and saw that Brown Jenkin had come to her aid. With one
   savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard
   it whimper on some level far below.

   Whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know, but he let her
   rest on the floor where she had fallen. Then, as he turned away, he saw
   on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his
   reason. Brown Jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of
   demoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him,
   and his efforts had been in vain. What he had prevented the knife from
   doing to the victim's chest, the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy
   had done to a wrist--and the bowl so lately on the floor stood full
   beside the small lifeless body.

   In his dream-delirium Gilman heard the hellish alien-rhythmed chant of
   the Sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man
   must be there. Confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics,
   and he believed his subconscious mind held the angles which he needed
   to guide him back to the normal world alone and unaided for the first
   time. He felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own
   room, but whether he could ever escape through the slanting floor or
   the long-stooped egress he doubted greatly. Besides, would not an
   escape from a dream-loft bring him merely into a dream-house--an
   abnormal projection of the actual place he sought? He was wholly
   bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his
   experiences.

   The passage through the vague abysses would be frightful, for the
   Walpurgis-rhythm would be vibrating, and at last he would have to hear
   that hitherto-veiled cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded. Even
   now he could detect a low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected
   all too well. At Sabbat-time it always mounted and reached through to
   the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites. Half the chants of
   the Sabbat were patterned on this faintly overheard pulsing which no
   earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness. Gilman
   wondered, too, whether he could trust his instincts to take him back to
   the right part of space. How could he be sure he would not land on that
   green-litten hillside of a far planet, on the tessellated terrace above
   the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the
   spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of Chaos where reigns the
   mindless demon-sultan Azathoth?

   Just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him
   in utter blackness. The witch--old Keziah--Nahab--that must have meant
   her death. And mixed with the distant chant of the Sabbat and the
   whimpers of Brown Jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard another
   and wilder whine from unknown depths. Joe Mazurewicz--the prayers
   against the Crawling Chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant
   shriek--worlds of sardonic actuality impinging on vortices of febrile
   dream--Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young...

   They found Gilman on the floor of his queerly-angled old garret room
   long before dawn, for the terrible cry had brought Desrochers and
   Choynski and Dombrowski and Mazurewicz at once, and had even wakened
   the soundly sleeping Elwood in his chair. He was alive, and with open,
   staring eyes, but seemed largely unconscious. On his throat were the
   marks of murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing
   rat-bite. His clothing was badly rumpled and Joe's crucifix was
   missing, Elwood trembled, afraid even to speculate what new form his
   friend's sleep-walking had taken. Mazurewicz seemed half dazed because
   of a "sign" he said he had had in response to his prayers, and he
   crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat
   sounded from beyond the slanting partition.

   When the dreamer was settled on his couch in Elwood's room they sent
   for Doctor Malkowski--a local practitioner who would repeat no tales
   where they might prove embarrassing--and he gave Gilman two hypodermic
   injections which caused him to relax in something like natural
   drowsiness. During the day the patient regained consciousness at times
   and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to Elwood. It was a painful
   process, and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting
   fact.

   Gilman--whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal
   sensitiveness--was now stone-deaf. Doctor Malkowski, summoned again in
   haste, told Elwood that both ear-drums were ruptured, as if by the
   impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception or
   endurance. How such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours
   without arousing all the Miskatonic Valley was more than the honest
   physician could say.

   Elwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper, so that a fairly easy
   communication was maintained. Neither knew what to make of the whole
   chaotic business, and decided it would be better if they thought as
   little as possible about it. Both, though, agreed that they must leave
   this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged.
   Evening papers spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a
   ravine beyond Meadow Hill just before dawn, and mentioned that the
   white stone there was an object of age-long superstitious regard.
   Nobody had been caught, but among the scattering fugitives had been
   glimpsed a huge negro. In another column it was stated that no trace of
   the missing child Ladislas Wolejko had been found.

   The crowning horror came that very night. Elwood will never forget it,
   and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of
   the resulting nervous breakdown. He had thought he heard rats in the
   partition all the evening, but paid little attention to them. Then,
   long after both he and Gilman had retired, the atrocious shrieking
   began. Elwood jumped up, turned on the lights and rushed over to his
   guest's couch. The occupant was emitting sounds of veritably inhuman
   nature, as if racked by some torment beyond description. He was
   writhing under the bedclothes, and a great stain was beginning to
   appear on the blankets.

   Elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and
   writhing subsided. By this time Dombrowski, Choynski, Desrochers,
   Mazurewicz, and the top-floor lodger were all crowding into the
   doorway, and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for
   Doctor Malkowski. Everybody shrieked when a large rat-like form
   suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and
   scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by. When the
   doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers Walter
   Gilman was dead.

   It would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed Gilman.
   There had been virtually a tunnel through his body--something had eaten
   his heart out. Dombrowski, frantic at the failure of his rat-poisoning
   efforts, cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had
   moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in
   Walnut Street. The worst thing for a while was keeping Joe Mazurewicz
   quiet; for the brooding loom-fixer would never stay sober, and was
   constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible things.

   It seems that on that last hideous night Joe had stooped to look at the
   crimson rat-tracks which led from Gilman's couch to the near-by hole.
   On the carpet they were very indistinct, but a piece of open flooring
   intervened between the carpet's edge and the baseboard. There
   Mazurewicz had found something monstrous--or thought he had, for no one
   else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the
   prints. The tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the
   average prints of a rat but even Choynski and Desrochers would not
   admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands.

   The house was never rented again. As soon as Dombrowski left it the
   pall of its final desolation began to descend, for people shunned it
   both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid
   odour. Perhaps the ex-landlord's rat-poison had worked after all, for
   not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance.
   Health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside
   the eastern garret room, and agreed that the number of dead rats must
   be enormous. They decided, however, that it was not worth their while
   to hew open and disinfect the long-sealed spaces; for the foetor would
   soon be over, and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious
   standards. Indeed, there were always vague local tales of unexplained
   stenches upstairs in the Witch-House just after May-Eve and Hallowmass.
   The neighbours acquiesced in the inertia--but the foetor none the less
   formed an additional count against the place. Toward the last the house
   was condemned as a habitation by the building inspector.

   Gilman's dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been
   explained. Elwood, whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes
   almost maddening, came back to college the next autumn and was
   graduated in the following June. He found the spectral gossip of the
   town much disminished, and it is indeed a fact that--notwithstanding
   certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which
   lasted almost as long as that edifice itself--no fresh appearances
   either of Old Keziah or of Brown Jenkin have been muttered of since
   Gilman's death. It is rather fortunate that Elwood was not in Arkham in
   that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers
   about elder horrors. Of course he heard about the matter afterward and
   suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation; but even
   that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights
   would have been.

   In March, 1931, a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant
   Witch-House, so that a chaos of crumbling bricks, blackened, moss-grown
   shingles, and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and
   broke through the floor beneath. The whole attic storey was choked with
   debris from above, but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before
   the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure. That ultimate step
   came in the following December, and it was when Gilman's old room was
   cleared out by reluctant, apprehensive workmen that the gossip began.

   Among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting
   ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in
   the police. Later the police in turn called in the coroner and several
   professors from the university. There were bones--badly crushed and
   splintered, but clearly recognizable as human--whose manifestly modern
   date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only
   possible lurking place, the low, slant-floored loft overhead, had
   supposedly been sealed from all human access. The coroner's physician
   decided that some belonged to a small child, while certain
   others--found mixed with shreds of rotten brownish cloth--belonged to a
   rather undersized, bent female of advanced years. Careful sifting of
   debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse,
   as well as older rat-bones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and
   then highly productive of controversy and reflection.

   Other objects found included the mangled fragments of many books and
   papers, together with a yellowish dust left from the total
   disintegration of still older books and papers. All, without exception,
   appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible
   forms; and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a
   mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones. An even greater
   mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed, archaic writing
   found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest
   age differences of at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred years.
   To some, though, the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly
   inexplicable objects--objects whose shapes, materials, types of
   workmanship, and purposes baffle all conjecture--found scattered amidst
   the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury. One of these
   things--which excited several Miskatonic professors profoundly--is a
   badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which
   Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is large, wrought of
   some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a
   singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics.

   Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the
   bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner
   side bore ominous brownish stains when found. Foreigners and credulous
   grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix
   with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by
   Joe Mazurewicz as that which he had given poor Gilman many years
   before. Some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by
   rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner
   of Gilman's old room at the time. Still others, including Joe himself,
   have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence.

   When the slanting wall of Gilman's room was torn out, the once-sealed
   triangular space between that partition and the house's north wall was
   found to contain much less structural debris, even in proportion to its
   size, than the room itself, though it had a ghastly layer of older
   materials which paralyzed the wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor
   was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small children--some fairly
   modern, but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so
   remote that crumbling was almost complete. On this deep bony layer
   rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate,
   and exotic design--above which the debris was piled.

   In the midst of this debris, wedged between a fallen plank and a
   cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney, was an object
   destined to cause more bafflement, veiled fright, and openly
   superstitious talk in Arkham than anything else discovered in the
   haunted and accursed building.

   This object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat,
   whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of
   singular reticence among the members of Miskatonic's department of
   comparative anatomy. Very little concerning this skeleton has leaked
   out, but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the
   long, brownish hairs with which it was associated.

   The bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile
   characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat,
   while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost
   anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature,
   monstrously degraded parody of a human skull. The workmen crossed
   themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy, but later
   burned candles of gratitude in St. Stanislaus' Church because of the
   shrill, ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again.

The Dunwich Horror

   The Dunwich Horror
   by H.P. Lovecraft
   Chapter I->

     The Dunwich Horror is a short story by H. P. Lovecraft. Written in
     1928, it was first published in the April 1929 issue of Weird Tales
    (pp. 481-508). -- Excerpted from The Dunwich Horror on Wikipedia, the
                             free encyclopedia.

   886The Dunwich HorrorH.P. Lovecraft

   Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimaeras--dire stories of Celaeno and the
   Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition--but
   they were there before. They are transcripts, types--the archetypes are
   in us, and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know
   in a waking sense to be false come to affect us at all? Is it that we
   naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their
   capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of
   all! These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body--or
   without the body, they would have been the same... That the kind of
   fear here treated is purely spiritual--that it is strong in proportion
   as it is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our
   sinless infancy--are difficulties the solution of which might afford
   some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a peep at
   least into the shadowland of pre-existence.

                             --Charles Lamb: Witches and Other Night-Fears

   Castro1929

   For one who has never faced the danger of legal execution, I have a
   rather queer horror of the electric chair as a subject. Indeed, I think
   the topic gives me more of a shudder than it gives many a man who has
   been on trial for his life. The reason is that I associate the thing
   with an incident of forty years ago--a very strange incident which
   brought me close to the edge of the unknown's black abyss. In 1889 I
   was an auditor and investigator connected with the Tlaxcala Mining
   Company of San Francisco, which operated several small silver and
   copper properties in the San Mateo Mountains in Mexico. There had been
   some trouble at Mine No. 3, which had a surly, furtive assistant
   superintendent named Arthur Feldon; and on August 6th the firm received
   a telegram saying that Feldon had decamped, taking with him all the
   stock records, securities, and private papers, and leaving the whole
   clerical and financial situation in dire confusion. This development
   was a severe blow to the company, and late in the afternoon President
   McComb called me into his office to give orders for the recovery of the
   papers at any cost. There were, he knew, grave drawbacks. I had never
   seen Feldon, and there were only very indifferent photographs to go by.
   Moreover, my own wedding was set for Thursday of the following
   week--only nine days ahead--so that I was naturally not eager to be
   hurried off to Mexico on a man-hunt of indefinite length. The need,
   however, was so great that McComb felt justified in asking me to go at
   once; and I for my part decided that the effect on my status with the
   company would make ready acquiescence eminently worth while.

   I was to start that night, using the president's private car as far as
   Mexico City, after which I would have to take a narrow-gauge railway to
   the mines. Jackson, the superintendent of No. 3, would give me all
   details and any possible clues upon my arrival; and then the search
   would begin in earnest--through the mountains, down to the coast, or
   among the byways of Mexico City, as the case might be. I set out with a
   grim determination to get the matter done--and successfully done--as
   swiftly as possible; and tempered my discontent with pictures of an
   early return with papers and culprit, and of a wedding which would be
   almost a triumphal ceremony. Having notified my family, fiancée, and
   principal friends, and made hasty preparations for the trip, I met
   President McComb at eight p.m. at the Southern Pacific depot, received
   from him some written instructions and a check-book, and left in his
   car attached to the 8:15 eastbound transcontinental train. The journey
   that followed seemed destined for uneventfulness, and after a good
   night's sleep I revelled in the ease of the private car so thoughtfully
   assigned me; reading my instructions with care, and formulating plans
   for the capture of Feldon and the recovery of the documents. I knew the
   Tlaxcala country quite well--probably much better than the missing
   man--hence had a certain amount of advantage in my search unless he had
   already used the railway.

   According to the instructions, Feldon had been a subject of worry to
   Superintendent Jackson for some time; acting secretively, and working
   unaccountably in the company's laboratory at odd hours. That he was
   implicated with a Mexican boss and several peons in some thefts of ore
   was strongly suspected; but though the natives had been discharged,
   there was not enough evidence to warrant any positive step regarding
   the subtle official. Indeed, despite his furtiveness, there seemed to
   be more of defiance than of guilt in the man's bearing. He wore a chip
   on his shoulder, and talked as if the company were cheating him instead
   of his cheating the company. The obvious surveillance of his
   colleagues, Jackson wrote, appeared to irritate him increasingly; and
   now he had gone with everything of importance in the office. Of his
   possible whereabouts no guess could be made; though Jackson's final
   telegram suggested the wild slopes of the Sierra de Malinche, that
   tall, myth-surrounded peak with the corpse-shaped silhouette, from
   whose neighbourhood the thieving natives were said to have come.

   At El Paso, which we reached at two a.m. of the night following our
   start, my private car was detached from the transcontinental train and
   joined to an engine specially ordered by telegraph to take it southward
   to Mexico City. I continued to drowse till dawn, and all the next day
   grew bored on the flat, desert Chihuahua landscape. The crew had told
   me we were due in Mexico City at noon Friday, but I soon saw that
   countless delays were wasting precious hours. There were waits on
   sidings all along the single-tracked route, and now and then a hot-box
   or other difficulty would further complicate the schedule.

   At Torreón we were six hours late, and it was almost eight o'clock on
   Friday evening--fully twelve hours behind schedule--when the conductor
   consented to do some speeding in an effort to make up time. My nerves
   were on edge, and I could do nothing but pace the car in desperation.
   In the end I found that the speeding had been purchased at a high cost
   indeed, for within a half-hour the symptoms of a hot-box had developed
   in my car itself; so that after a maddening wait the crew decided that
   all the bearings would have to be overhauled after a quarter-speed limp
   ahead to the next station with shops--the factory town of Querétaro.
   This was the last straw, and I almost stamped like a child. Actually I
   sometimes caught myself pushing at my chair-arm as if trying to urge
   the train forward at a less snail-like pace.

   It was almost ten in the evening when we drew into Querétaro, and I
   spent a fretful hour on the station platform while my car was
   sidetracked and tinkered at by a dozen native mechanics. At last they
   told me the job was too much for them, since the forward truck needed
   new parts which could not be obtained nearer than Mexico City.
   Everything indeed seemed against me, and I gritted my teeth when I
   thought of Feldon getting farther and farther away--perhaps to the easy
   cover of Vera Cruz with its shipping or Mexico City with its varied
   rail facilities--while fresh delays kept me tied and helpless. Of
   course Jackson had notified the police in all the cities around, but I
   knew with sorrow what their efficiency amounted to.

   The best I could do, I soon found out, was to take the regular night
   express for Mexico City, which ran from Aguas Calientes and made a
   five-minute stop at Querétaro. It would be along at one a.m. if on
   time, and was due in Mexico City at five o'clock Saturday morning. When
   I purchased my ticket I found that the train would be made up of
   European compartment carriages instead of long American cars with rows
   of two-seat chairs. These had been much used in the early days of
   Mexican railroading, owing to the European construction interests back
   of the first lines; and in 1889 the Mexican Central was still running a
   fair number of them on its shorter trips. Ordinarily I prefer the
   American coaches, since I hate to have people facing me; but for this
   once I was glad of the foreign carriage. At such a time of night I
   stood a good chance of having a whole compartment to myself, and in my
   tired, nervously hypersensitive state I welcomed the solitude--as well
   as the comfortably upholstered seat with soft arm-rests and
   head-cushion, running the whole width of the vehicle. I bought a
   first-class ticket, obtained my valise from the sidetracked private
   car, telegraphed both President McComb and Jackson of what had
   happened, and settled down in the station to wait for the night express
   as patiently as my strained nerves would let me. For a wonder, the
   train was only half an hour late; though even so, the solitary station
   vigil had about finished my endurance. The conductor, shewing me into a
   compartment, told me he expected to make up the delay and reach the
   capital on time; and I stretched myself comfortably on the
   forward-facing seat in the expectation of a quiet three-and-a-half-hour
   run. The light from the overhead oil lamp was soothingly dim, and I
   wondered whether I could snatch some much-needed sleep in spite of my
   anxiety and nerve-tension. It seemed, as the train jolted into motion,
   that I was alone; and I was heartily glad of it. My thoughts leaped
   ahead to my quest, and I nodded with the accelerating rhythm of the
   speeding string of carriages.

   Then suddenly I perceived that I was not alone after all. In the corner
   diagonally opposite me, slumped down so that his face was invisible,
   sat a roughly clad man of unusual size, whom the feeble light had
   failed to reveal before. Beside him on the seat was a huge valise,
   battered and bulging, and tightly gripped even in his sleep by one of
   his incongruously slender hands. As the engine whistled sharply at some
   curve or crossing, the sleeper started nervously into a kind of
   watchful half-awakening; raising his head and disclosing a handsome
   face, bearded and clearly Anglo-Saxon, with dark, lustrous eyes. At
   sight of me his wakefulness became complete, and I wondered at the
   rather hostile wildness of his glance. No doubt, I thought, he resented
   my presence when he had hoped to have the compartment alone all the
   way; just as I was myself disappointed to find strange company in the
   half-lighted carriage. The best we could do, however, was to accept the
   situation gracefully; so I began apologising to the man for my
   intrusion. He seemed to be a fellow-American, and we could both feel
   more at ease after a few civilities. Then we could leave each other in
   peace for the balance of the journey.

   To my surprise, the stranger did not respond to my courtesies with so
   much as a word. Instead, he kept staring at me fiercely and almost
   appraisingly, and brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a cigar with
   a nervous lateral movement of his disengaged hand. His other hand still
   tensely clutched the great, worn valise, and his whole person seemed to
   radiate some obscure malignity. After a time he abruptly turned his
   face toward the window, though there was nothing to see in the dense
   blackness outside. Oddly, he appeared to be looking at something as
   intently as if there really were something to look at. I decided to
   leave him to his own curious devices and meditations without further
   annoyance; so settled back in my seat, drew the brim of my soft hat
   over my face, and closed my eyes in an effort to snatch the sleep I had
   half counted on.

   I could not have dozed very long or very fully when my eyes fell open
   as if in response to some external force. Closing them again with some
   determination, I renewed my quest of a nap, yet wholly without avail.
   An intangible influence seemed bent on keeping me awake; so raising my
   head, I looked about the dimly lighted compartment to see if anything
   were amiss. All appeared normal, but I noticed that the stranger in the
   opposite corner was looking at me very intently--intently, though
   without any of the geniality or friendliness which would have implied a
   change from his former surly attitude. I did not attempt conversation
   this time, but leaned back in my previous sleepy posture; half closing
   my eyes as if I had dozed off once more, yet continuing to watch him
   curiously from beneath my down-turned hat brim. As the train rattled
   onward through the night I saw a subtle and gradual metamorphosis come
   over the expression of the staring man. Evidently satisfied that I was
   asleep, he allowed his face to reflect a curious jumble of emotions,
   the nature of which seemed anything but reassuring. Hatred, fear,
   triumph, and fanaticism flickered compositely over the lines of his
   lips and the angles of his eyes, while his gaze became a glare of
   really alarming greed and ferocity. Suddenly it dawned upon me that
   this man was mad, and dangerously so. I will not pretend that I was
   anything but deeply and thoroughly frightened when I saw how things
   stood. Perspiration started out all over me, and I had hard work to
   maintain my attitude of relaxation and slumber. Life had many
   attractions for me just then, and the thought of dealing with a
   homicidal maniac--possibly armed and certainly powerful to a marvellous
   degree--was a dismaying and terrifying one. My disadvantage in any sort
   of struggle was enormous; for the man was a virtual giant, evidently in
   the best of athletic trim, while I have always been rather frail, and
   was then almost worn out with anxiety, sleeplessness, and nervous
   tension. It was undeniably a bad moment for me, and I felt pretty close
   to a horrible death as I recognised the fury of madness in the
   stranger's eyes. Events from the past came up into my consciousness as
   if for a farewell--just as a drowning man's whole life is said to
   resurrect itself before him at the last moment.

   Of course I had my revolver in my coat pocket, but any motion of mine
   to reach and draw it would be instantly obvious. Moreover, if I did
   secure it, there was no telling what effect it would have on the
   maniac. Even if I shot him once or twice he might have enough remaining
   strength to get the gun from me and deal with me in his own way; or if
   he were armed himself he might shoot or stab without trying to disarm
   me. One can cow a sane man by covering him with a pistol, but an insane
   man's complete indifference to consequences gives him a strength and
   menace quite superhuman for the time being. Even in those pre-Freudian
   days I had a common-sense realisation of the dangerous power of a
   person without normal inhibitions. That the stranger in the corner was
   indeed about to start some murderous action, his burning eyes and
   twitching facial muscles did not permit me to doubt for a moment.

   Suddenly I heard his breath begin to come in excited gasps, and saw his
   chest heaving with mounting excitement. The time for a showdown was
   close, and I tried desperately to think of the best thing to do.
   Without interrupting my pretence of sleep, I began to slide my right
   hand gradually and inconspicuously toward the pocket containing my
   pistol; watching the madman closely as I did so, to see if he would
   detect any move. Unfortunately he did--almost before he had time to
   register the fact in his expression. With a bound so agile and abrupt
   as to be almost incredible in a man of his size, he was upon me before
   I knew what had happened; looming up and swaying forward like a giant
   ogre of legend, and pinioning me with one powerful hand while with the
   other he forestalled me in reaching the revolver. Taking it from my
   pocket and placing it in his own, he released me contemptuously, well
   knowing how fully his physique placed me at his mercy. Then he stood up
   at his full height--his head almost touching the roof of the
   carriage--and stared down at me with eyes whose fury had quickly turned
   to a look of pitying scorn and ghoulish calculation.

   I did not move, and after a moment the man resumed his seat opposite
   me; smiling a ghastly smile as he opened his great bulging valise and
   extracted an article of peculiar appearance--a rather large cage of
   semi-flexible wire, woven somewhat like a baseball catcher's mask, but
   shaped more like the helmet of a diving-suit. Its top was connected
   with a cord whose other end remained in the valise. This device he
   fondled with obvious affection, cradling it in his lap as he looked at
   me afresh and licked his bearded lips with an almost feline motion of
   the tongue. Then, for the first time, he spoke--in a deep, mellow voice
   of softness and cultivation startlingly at variance with his rough
   corduroy clothes and unkempt aspect.

   "You are fortunate, sir. I shall use you first of all. You shall go
   into history as the first fruits of a remarkable invention. Vast
   sociological consequences--I shall let my light shine, as it were. I'm
   radiating all the time, but nobody knows it. Now you shall know.
   Intelligent guinea-pig. Cats and burros--it worked even with a burro. .
   . ."

   He paused, while his bearded features underwent a convulsive motion
   closely synchronised with a vigorous gyratory shaking of the whole
   head. It was as though he were shaking clear of some nebulous
   obstructing medium, for the gesture was followed by a clarification or
   subtilisation of expression which hid the more obvious madness in a
   look of suave composure through which the craftiness gleamed only
   dimly. I glimpsed the difference at once, and put in a word to see if I
   could lead his mind into harmless channels. "You seem to have a
   marvellously fine instrument, if I'm any judge. Won't you tell me how
   you came to invent it?" He nodded.

   "Mere logical reflection, dear sir. I consulted the needs of the age
   and acted upon them. Others might have done the same had their minds
   been as powerful--that is, as capable of sustained concentration--as
   mine. I had the sense of conviction--the available will power--that is
   all. I realised, as no one else has yet realised, how imperative it is
   to remove everybody from the earth before Quetzalcoatl comes back, and
   realised also that it must be done elegantly. I hate butchery of any
   kind, and hanging is barbarously crude. You know last year the New York
   legislature voted to adopt electric execution for condemned men--but
   all the apparatus they have in mind is as primitive as Stephenson's
   `Rocket' or Davenport's first electric engine. I knew of a better way,
   and told them so, but they paid no attention to me. God, the fools! As
   if I didn't know all there is to know about men and death and
   electricity--student, man, and boy--technologist and engineer--soldier
   of fortune. . . ."

   He leaned back and narrowed his eyes.

   "I was in Maximilian's army twenty years and more ago. They were going
   to make me a nobleman. Then those damned greasers killed him and I had
   to go home. But I came back--back and forth, back and forth. I live in
   Rochester, N.Y. . . ."

   His eyes grew deeply crafty, and he leaned forward, touching me on the
   knee with the fingers of a paradoxically delicate hand. "I came back, I
   say, and I went deeper than any of them. I hate greasers, but I like
   Mexicans! A puzzle? Listen to me, young fellow--you don't think Mexico
   is really Spanish, do you? God, if you knew the tribes I know! In the
   mountains--in the mountains--Anahuac--Tenochtitlan--the old ones. . .
   ."

   His voice changed to a chanting and not unmelodious howl.

   "I?! Huitzilopotchli! . . . Nahuatlacatl! Seven, seven, seven . . .
   Xochimilca, Chalca, Tepaneca, Acolhua, Tlahuica, Tlascalteca, Azteca! .
   . . I?! I?! I have been to the Seven Caves of Chicomoztoc, but no one
   shall ever know! I tell you because you will never repeat it.

   He subsided, and resumed a conversational tone.

   "It would surprise you to know what things are told in the mountains.
   Huitzilopotchli is coming back . . . of that there can be no doubt. Any
   peon south of Mexico City can tell you that. But I meant to do nothing
   about it. I went home, as I tell you, again and again, and was going to
   benefit society with my electric executioner when that cursed Albany
   legislature adopted the other way. A joke, sir, a joke! Grandfather's
   chair--sit by the fireside--Hawthorne--"

   The man was chuckling with a morbid parody of good nature.

   "Why, sir, I'd like to be the first man to sit in their damned chair
   and feel their little two-bit battery current! It wouldn't make a
   frog's legs dance! And they expect to kill murderers with it--reward of
   merit--everything! But then, young man, I saw the uselessness--the
   pointless illogicality, as it were--of killing just a few. Everybody is
   a murderer--they murder ideas--steal inventions--stole mine by
   watching, and watching, and watching--"

   The man choked and paused, and I spoke soothingly.

   "I'm sure your invention was much the better, and probably they'll come
   to use it in the end."

   Evidently my tact was not great enough, for his response shewed fresh
   irritation.

   "`Sure,' are you? Nice, mild, conservative assurance! Cursed lot you
   care--but you'll soon know! Why, damn you, all the good there ever will
   be in that electric chair will have been stolen from me. The ghost of
   Nezahualpilli told me that on the sacred mountain. They watched, and
   watched, and watched--"

   He choked again, then gave another of those gestures in which he seemed
   to shake both his head and his facial expression. That seemed
   temporarily to steady him.

   "What my invention needs is testing. That is it--here. The wire hood or
   head-net is flexible, and slips on easily. Neckpiece binds but doesn't
   choke. Electrodes touch forehead and base of cerebellum--all that's
   necessary. Stop the head, and what else can go? The fools up at Albany,
   with their carved oak easy-chair, think they've got to make it a
   head-to-foot affair. Idiots!--don't they know that you don't need to
   shoot a man through the body after you've plugged him through the
   brain? I've seen men die in battle--I know better. And then their silly
   high-power circuit--dynamos--all that. Why didn't they see what I've
   done with the storage-battery? Not a hearing--nobody knows--I alone
   have the secret--that's why I and Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopotchli will
   rule the world alone--I and they, if I choose to let them. . . . But I
   must have experimental subjects--subjects--do you know whom I've chosen
   for the first?"

   I tried jocoseness, quickly merging into friendly seriousness, as a
   sedative. Quick thought and apt words might save me yet.

   "Well, there are lots of fine subjects among the politicians of San
   Francisco, where I come from! They need your treatment, and I'd like to
   help you introduce it! But really, I think I can help you in all truth.
   I have some influence in Sacramento, and if you'll go back to the
   States with me after I'm through with my business in Mexico, I'll see
   that you get a hearing."

   He answered soberly and civilly.

   "No--I can't go back. I swore not to when those criminals at Albany
   turned down my invention and set spies to watch me and steal from me.
   But I must have American subjects. Those greasers are under a curse,
   and would be too easy; and the full-blood Indians--the real children of
   the feathered serpent--are sacred and inviolate except for proper
   sacrificial victims . . . and even those must be slain according to
   ceremony. I must have Americans without going back--and the first man I
   choose will be signally honoured. Do you know who he is?" I temporised
   desperately.

   "Oh, if that's all the trouble, I'll find you a dozen first-rate Yankee
   specimens as soon as we get to Mexico City! I know where there are lots
   of small mining men who wouldn't be missed for days--"

   But he cut me short with a new and sudden air of authority which had a
   touch of real dignity in it.

   "That'll do--we've trifled long enough. Get up and stand erect like a
   man. You're the subject I've chosen, and you'll thank me for the honour
   in the other world, just as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest
   for transferring him to eternal glory. A new principle--no other man
   alive has dreamed of such a battery, and it might never again be hit on
   if the world experimented a thousand years. Do you know that atoms
   aren't what they seem? Fools! A century after this some dolt would be
   guessing if I were to let the world live!" As I arose at his command,
   he drew additional feet of cord from the valise and stood erect beside
   me; the wire helmet outstretched toward me in both hands, and a look of
   real exaltation on his tanned and bearded face. For an instant he
   seemed like a radiant Hellenic mystagogue or hierophant.

   "Here, O Youth--a libation! Wine of the cosmos--nectar of the starry
   spaces--Linos--Iacchus--Ialmenos--Zagreus--Dionysos--Atys--Hylas--sprun
   g from Apollo and slain by the hounds of Argos--seed of Psamathe--child
   of the sun--Evoë! Evoë!"

   He was chanting again, and this time his mind seemed far back amongst
   the classic memories of his college days. In my erect posture I noticed
   the nearness of the signal cord overhead, and wondered whether I could
   reach it through some gesture of ostensible response to his ceremonial
   mood. It was worth trying, so with an antiphonal cry of "Evoë!" I put
   my arms forward and upward toward him in a ritualistic fashion, hoping
   to give the cord a tug before he could notice the act. But it was
   useless. He saw my purpose, and moved one hand toward the right-hand
   coat pocket where my revolver lay. No words were needed, and we stood
   for a moment like carven figures. Then he quietly said, "Make haste!"

   Again my mind rushed frantically about seeking avenues of escape. The
   doors, I knew, were not locked on Mexican trains; but my companion
   could easily forestall me if I tried to unlatch one and jump out.
   Besides, our speed was so great that success in that direction would
   probably be as fatal as failure. The only thing to do was to play for
   time. Of the three-and-a-half-hour trip a good slice was already worn
   away, and once we got to Mexico City the guards and police in the
   station would provide instant safety.

   There would, I thought, be two distinct times for diplomatic stalling.
   If I could get him to postpone the slipping on of the hood, that much
   time would be gained. Of course I had no belief that the thing was
   really deadly; but I knew enough of madmen to understand what would
   happen when it failed to work. To his disappointment would be added a
   mad sense of my responsibility for the failure, and the result would be
   a red chaos of murderous rage. Therefore the experiment must be
   postponed as long as possible. Yet the second opportunity did exist,
   for if I planned cleverly I might devise explanations for the failure
   which would hold his attention and lead him into more or less extended
   searches for corrective influences. I wondered just how far his
   credulity went, and whether I could prepare in advance a prophecy of
   failure which would make the failure itself stamp me as a seer or
   initiate, or perhaps a god. I had enough of a smattering of Mexican
   mythology to make it worth trying; though I would try other delaying
   influences first and let the prophecy come as a sudden revelation.
   Would he spare me in the end if I could make him think me a prophet or
   divinity? Could I "get by" as Quetzalcoatl or Huitzilopotchli? Anything
   to drag matters out till five o'clock, when we were due in Mexico City.

   But my opening "stall" was the veteran will-making ruse. As the maniac
   repeated his command for haste, I told him of my family and intended
   marriage, and asked for the privilege of leaving a message and
   disposing of my money and effects. If, I said, he would lend me some
   paper and agree to mail what I should write, I could die more
   peacefully and willingly. After some cogitation he gave a favourable
   verdict and fished in his valise for a pad, which he handed me solemnly
   as I resumed my seat. I produced a pencil, artfully breaking the point
   at the outset and causing some delay while he searched for one of his
   own. When he gave me this, he took my broken pencil and proceeded to
   sharpen it with a large, horn-handled knife which had been in his belt
   under his coat. Evidently a second pencil-breaking would not profit me
   greatly.

   What I wrote, I can hardly recall at this date. It was largely
   gibberish, and composed of random scraps of memorised literature when I
   could think of nothing else to set down. I made my handwriting as
   illegible as I could without destroying its nature as writing; for I
   knew he would be likely to look at the result before commencing his
   experiment, and realised how he would react to the sight of obvious
   nonsense. The ordeal was a terrible one, and I chafed each second at
   the slowness of the train. In the past I had often whistled a brisk
   gallop to the sprightly "tac" of wheels on rails, but now the tempo
   seemed slowed down to that of a funeral march--my funeral march, I
   grimly reflected.

   My ruse worked till I had covered over four pages, six by nine; when at
   last the madman drew out his watch and told me I could have but five
   minutes more. What should I do next? I was hastily going through the
   form of concluding the will when a new idea struck me. Ending with a
   flourish and handing him the finished sheets, which he thrust
   carelessly into his left-hand coat pocket, I reminded him of my
   influential Sacramento friends who would be so much interested in his
   invention.

   "Oughtn't I to give you a letter of introduction to them?" I said
   "Oughtn't I to make a signed sketch and description of your executioner
   so that they'll grant you a cordial hearing? They can make you famous,
   you know--and there's no question at all but that they'll adopt your
   method for the state of California if they hear of it through someone
   like me, whom they know and trust."

   I was taking this tack on the chance that his thoughts as a
   disappointed inventor would let him forget the Aztec-religious side of
   his mania for a while. When he veered to the latter again, I reflected,
   I would spring the "revelation" and "prophecy". The scheme worked, for
   his eyes glowed an eager assent, though he brusquely told me to be
   quick. He further emptied the valise, lifting out a queer-looking
   congeries of glass cells and coils to which the wire from the helmet
   was attached, and delivering a fire of running comment too technical
   for me to follow yet apparently quite plausible and straightforward. I
   pretended to note down all he said, wondering as I did so whether the
   queer apparatus was really a battery after all. Would I get a slight
   shock when he applied the device? The man surely talked as if he were a
   genuine electrician. Description of his own invention was clearly a
   congenial task for him, and I saw he was not as impatient as before.
   The hopeful grey of dawn glimmered red through the windows before he
   wound up, and I felt at last that my chance of escape had really become
   tangible.

   But he, too, saw the dawn, and began glaring wildly again. He knew the
   train was due in Mexico City at five, and would certainly force quick
   action unless I could override all his judgment with engrossing ideas.
   As he rose with a determined air, setting the battery on the seat
   beside the open valise, I reminded him that I had not made the needed
   sketch; and asked him to hold the headpiece so that I could draw it
   near the battery. He complied and resumed his seat, with many
   admonitions to me to hurry. After another moment I paused for some
   information, asking him how the victim was placed for execution, and
   how his presumable struggles were overcome.

   "Why," he replied, "the criminal is securely strapped to a post. It
   does not matter how much he tosses his head, for the helmet fits
   tightly and draws even closer when the current comes on. We turn the
   switch gradually--you see it here, a carefully arranged affair with a
   rheostat."

   A new idea for delay occurred to me as the tilled fields and
   increasingly frequent houses in the dawnlight outside told of our
   approach to the capital at last.

   "But," I said, "I must draw the helmet in place on a human head as well
   as beside the battery. Can't you slip it on yourself a moment so that I
   can sketch you with it? The papers as well as the officials will want
   all this, and they are strong on completeness." I had, by chance, made
   a better shot than I had planned; for at my mention of the press the
   madman's eyes lit up afresh. "The papers? Yes--damn them, you can make
   even the papers give me a hearing! They all laughed at me and wouldn't
   print a word. Here, you, hurry up! We've not a second to lose!"

   He had slipped the headpiece on and was watching my flying pencil
   avidly. The wire mesh gave him a grotesque, comic look as he sat there
   with nervously twitching hands.

   "Now, curse 'em, they'll print pictures! I'll revise your sketch if you
   make any blunders--must be accurate at any cost. Police will find you
   afterward--they'll tell how it works. Associated Press item--back up
   your letter--immortal fame. . . . Hurry, I say--hurry, confound you!"
   The train was lurching over the poorer roadbed near the city and we
   swayed disconcertingly now and then. With this excuse I managed to
   break the pencil again, but of course the maniac at once handed me my
   own which he had sharpened. My first batch of ruses was about used up,
   and I felt that I should have to submit to the headpiece in a moment.
   We were still a good quarter-hour from the terminal, and it was about
   time for me to divert my companion to his religious side and spring the
   divine prophecy.

   Mustering up my scraps of Nahuan-Aztec mythology, I suddenly threw down
   pencil and paper and commenced to chant.

   "I?! I?! Tloquenahuaque, Thou Who Art All In Thyself! Thou too,
   Ipalnemoan, By Whom We Live! I hear, I hear! I see, I see!
   Serpent-bearing Eagle, hail! A message! A message! Huitzilopotchli, in
   my soul echoes thy thunder!"

   At my intonations the maniac stared incredulously through his odd mask,
   his handsome face shewn in a surprise and perplexity which quickly
   changed to alarm. His mind seemed to go blank a moment, and then to
   recrystallise in another pattern. Raising his hands aloft, he chanted
   as if in a dream.

   "Mictlanteuctli, Great Lord, a sign! A sign from within thy black cave!
   I?! Tonatiuh-Metztli! Cthulhutl! Command, and I serve!" Now in all this
   responsive gibberish there was one word which struck an odd chord in my
   memory. Odd, because it never occurs in any printed account of Mexican
   mythology, yet had been overheard by me more than once as an awestruck
   whisper amongst the peons in my own firm's Tlaxcala mines. It seemed to
   be part of an exceedingly secret and ancient ritual; for there were
   characteristic whispered responses which I had caught now and then, and
   which were as unknown as itself to academic scholarship. This maniac
   must have spent considerable time with the hill peons and Indians, just
   as he had said; for surely such unrecorded lore could have come from no
   mere book-learning. Realising the importance he must attach to this
   doubly esoteric jargon, I determined to strike at his most vulnerable
   spot and give him the gibberish responses the natives used.

   "Ya-R'lyeh! Ya-R'lyeh!" I shouted. "Cthulhutl fhtaghn! Niguratl-Yig!
   Yog-Sototl--"

   But I never had a chance to finish. Galvanised into a religious
   epilepsy by the exact response which his subconscious mind had probably
   not really expected, the madman scrambled down to a kneeling posture on
   the floor, bowing his wire-helmeted head again and again, and turning
   it to the right and left as he did so. With each turn his obeisances
   became more profound, and I could hear his foaming lips repeating the
   syllable "kill, kill, kill," in a rapidly swelling monotone. It
   occurred to me that I had overreached myself, and that my response had
   unloosed a mounting mania which would rouse him to the slaying-point
   before the train reached the station.

   As the arc of the madman's turnings gradually increased, the slack in
   the cord from his headpiece to the battery had naturally been taken up
   more and more. Now, in an all-forgetting delirium of ecstasy, he began
   to magnify his turns to complete circles, so that the cord wound round
   his neck and began to tug at its moorings to the battery on the seat. I
   wondered what he would do when the inevitable would happen, and the
   battery would be dragged to presumable destruction on the floor.

   Then came the sudden cataclysm. The battery, yanked over the seat's
   edge by the maniac's last gesture of orgiastic frenzy, did indeed fall;
   but it did not seem to have wholly broken. Instead, as my eye caught
   the spectacle in one too-fleeting instant, the actual impact was borne
   by the rheostat, so that the switch was jerked over instantly to full
   current. And the marvellous thing is that there was a current. The
   invention was no mere dream of insanity.

   I saw a blinding blue auroral coruscation, heard an ululating shriek
   more hideous than any of the previous cries of that mad, horrible
   journey, and smelled the nauseous odour of burning flesh. That was all
   my overwrought consciousness could bear, and I sank instantly into
   oblivion.

   When the train guard at Mexico City revived me, I found a crowd on the
   station platform around my compartment door. At my involuntary cry the
   pressing faces became curious and dubious, and I was glad when the
   guard shut out all but the trim doctor who had pushed his way through
   to me. My cry was a very natural thing, but it had been prompted by
   something more than the shocking sight on the carriage floor which I
   had expected to see. Or should say, by something less, because in truth
   there was not anything on the floor at all.

   Nor, said the guard, had there been when he opened the door and found
   me unconscious within. My ticket was the only one sold for that
   compartment, and I was the only person found within it. Just myself and
   my valise, nothing more. I had been alone all the way from Querétaro.
   Guard, doctor, and spectators alike tapped their foreheads
   significantly at my frantic and insistent questions.

   Had it all been a dream, or was I indeed mad? I recalled my anxiety and
   overwrought nerves, and shuddered. Thanking the guard and doctor, and
   shaking free of the curious crowd, I staggered into a cab and was taken
   to the Fonda Nacional, where, after telegraphing Jackson at the mine, I
   slept till afternoon in an effort to get a fresh grip on myself. I had
   myself called at one o'clock, in time to catch the narrow-gauge for the
   mining country, but when I got up I found a telegram under the door. It
   was from Jackson, and said that Feldon had been found dead in the
   mountains that morning, the news reaching the mine about ten o'clock.
   The papers were all safe, and the San Francisco office had been duly
   notified. So the whole trip, with its nervous haste and harrowing
   mental ordeal, had been for nothing! Knowing that McComb would expect a
   personal report despite the course of events, I sent another wire ahead
   and took the narrow-gauge after all. Four hours later I was rattled and
   jolted into the station of Mine No. 3, where Jackson was waiting to
   give a cordial greeting. He was so full of the affair at the mine that
   he did not notice my still shaken and seedy appearance.

   The superintendent's story was brief, and he told me it as he led me
   toward the shack up the hillside above the arrastre, where Feldon's
   body lay. Feldon, he said, had always been a queer, sullen character,
   ever since he was hired the year before; working at some secret
   mechanical device and complaining of constant espionage, and being
   disgustingly familiar with the native workmen. But he certainly knew
   the work, the country, and the people. He used to make long trips into
   the hills where the peons lived, and even to take part in some of their
   ancient, heathenish ceremonies. He hinted at odd secrets and strange
   powers as often as he boasted of his mechanical skill. Of late he had
   disintegrated rapidly; growing morbidly suspicious of his colleagues,
   and undoubtedly joining his native friends in ore-thieving after his
   cash got low. He needed unholy amounts of money for something or
   other--was always having boxes come from laboratories and machine shops
   in Mexico City or the States.

   As for the final absconding with all the papers--it was only a crazy
   gesture of revenge for what he called "spying". He was certainly stark
   mad, for he had gone across country to a hidden cave on the wild slope
   of the haunted Sierra de Malinche, where no white men live, and had
   done some amazingly queer things. The cave, which would never have been
   found but for the final tragedy, was full of hideous old Aztec idols
   and altars; the latter covered with the charred bones of recent
   burnt-offerings of doubtful nature. The natives would tell
   nothing--indeed, they swore they knew nothing--but it was easy to see
   that the cave was an old rendezvous of theirs, and that Feldon had
   shared their practices to the fullest extent.

   The searchers had found the place only because of the chanting and the
   final cry. It had been close to five that morning, and after an
   all-night encampment the party had begun to pack up for its
   empty-handed return to the mines. Then somebody had heard faint rhythms
   in the distance, and knew that one of the noxious old native rituals
   was being howled from some lonely spot up the slope of the
   corpse-shaped mountain. They heard the same old names--Mictlanteuctli,
   Tonatiuh-Metzli, Cthulhutl, Ya-R'lyeh, and all the rest--but the queer
   thing was that some English words were mixed with them. Real white
   man's English, and no greaser patter. Guided by the sound, they had
   hastened up the weed-entangled mountainside toward it, when after a
   spell of quiet the shriek had burst upon them. It was a terrible
   thing--a worse thing than any of them had ever heard before. There
   seemed to be some smoke, too, and a morbid acrid smell.

   Then they stumbled on the cave, its entrance screened by scrub
   mesquites, but now emitting clouds of foetid smoke. It was lighted
   within, the horrible altars and grotesque images revealed flickeringly
   by candles which must have been changed less than a half-hour before;
   and on the gravelly floor lay the horror that made all the crowd reel
   backward. It was Feldon, head burned to a crisp by some odd device he
   had slipped over it--a kind of wire cage connected with a rather
   shaken-up battery which had evidently fallen to the floor from a nearby
   altar-pot. When the men saw it they exchanged glances, thinking of the
   "electric executioner" Feldon had always boasted of inventing--the
   thing which everyone had rejected, but had tried to steal and copy. The
   papers were safe in Feldon's open portmanteau which stood close by, and
   an hour later the column of searchers started back for No. 3 with a
   grisly burden on an improvised stretcher.

   That was all, but it was enough to make me turn pale and falter as
   Jackson led me up past the arrastre to the shed where he said the body
   lay. For I was not without imagination, and knew only too well into
   what hellish nightmare this tragedy somehow supernaturally dovetailed.
   I knew what I should see inside that gaping door around which the
   curious miners clustered, and did not flinch when my eyes took in the
   giant form, the rough corduroy clothes, the oddly delicate hands, the
   wisps of burnt beard, and the hellish machine itself--battery slightly
   broken, and headpiece blackened by the charring of what was inside. The
   great, bulging portmanteau did not surprise me, and I quailed only at
   two things--the folded sheets of paper sticking out of the left-hand
   pocket, and the queer sagging of the corresponding right-hand pocket.
   In a moment when no one was looking I reached out and seized the too
   familiar sheets, crushing them in my hand without daring to look at
   their penmanship. I ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic fear
   made me burn them that night with averted eyes. They would have been a
   positive proof or disproof of something--but for that matter I could
   still have had proof by asking about the revolver the coroner afterward
   took from that sagging right-hand coat pocket. I never had the courage
   to ask about that--because my own revolver was missing after the night
   on the train. My pocket pencil, too, shewed signs of a crude and hasty
   sharpening unlike the precise pointing I had given it Friday afternoon
   on the machine in President McComb's private car.

   So in the end I went home still puzzled--mercifully puzzled, perhaps.
   The private car was repaired when I got back to Querétaro, but my
   greatest relief was crossing the Rio Grande into El Paso and the
   States. By the next Friday I was in San Francisco again, and the
   postponed wedding came off the following week.

   As to what really happened that night--as I've said, I simply don't
   dare to speculate. That chap Feldon was insane to start with, and on
   top of his insanity he had piled a lot of prehistoric Aztec witch-lore
   that nobody has any right to know. He was really an inventive genius,
   and that battery must have been the genuine stuff. I heard later how he
   had been brushed aside in former years by press, public, and potentates
   alike. Too much disappointment isn't good for men of a certain kind.
   Anyhow, some unholy combination of influences was at work. He had
   really, by the way, been a soldier of Maximilian's.

   When I tell my story most people call me a plain liar. Others lay it to
   abnormal psychology--and heaven knows I was overwrought--while still
   others talk of "astral projection" of some sort. My zeal to catch
   Feldon certainly sent my thoughts ahead toward him, and with all his
   Indian magic he'd be about the first one to recognise and meet them.
   Was he in the railway carriage or was I in the cave on the
   corpse-shaped haunted mountain? What would have happened to me, had I
   not delayed him as I did? I'll confess I don't know, and I'm not sure
   that I want to know. I've never been in Mexico since--and as I said at
   the start, I don't enjoy hearing about electric executions.

   The Evil Clergyman
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   8533The Evil ClergymanH. P. Lovecraft

   I was shown into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man
   with quiet clothes and an iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in this
   fashion:

   "Yes, he lived here - but I don't advise your doing anything. Your
   curiosity makes you irresponsible. We never come here at night, and
   it's only because of his will that we keep it this way. You know what
   he did. That abominable society took charge at last, and we don't know
   where he is buried. There was no way the law or anything else could
   reach the society.

   "I hope you won't stay till after dark. And I beg of you to let that
   thing on the table - the thing that looks like a match-box - alone. We
   don't know what it is, but we suspect it has something to do with what
   he did. We even avoid looking at it very steadily."

   After a time the man left me alone in the attic room. It was very dingy
   and dusty, and only primitively furnished, but it had a neatness which
   showed it was not a slum-denizen's quarters. There were shelves full of
   theological and classical books, and another bookcase containing
   treatises on magic -- Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes
   Trismegistus, Borellus, and others in a strange alphabet whose titles I
   could not decipher. The furniture was very plain. There was a door, but
   it led only into a closet. The only egress was the aperture in the
   floor up to which the crude, steep staircase led. The windows were of
   bull's-eye pattern, and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable
   antiquity. Plainly, this house was of the Old World. I seemed to know
   where I was, but cannot recall what I then knew. Certainly the town was
   not London. My impression is of a small seaport.

   The small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know
   what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light - or what looked
   like one - out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes. The light
   was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like
   some radioactive bombardment. I recall that I did not regard it as a
   common flashlight - indeed, I had a common flashlight in another
   pocket.

   It was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside
   looked very queer through the bull's-eye window-panes. Finally I
   summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table
   against a book - then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon
   it. The light seemed now to be more like a rain of hail or small violet
   particles than like a continuous beam. As the particles struck the
   glassy surface at the center of the strange device, they seemed to
   produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through
   which sparks are passed. The dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish
   glow, and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its center.
   Then I noticed that I was not alone in the room - and put the
   ray-projector back in my pocket.

   But the newcomer did not speak - nor did I hear any sound whatever
   during all the immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy
   pantomime, as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze
   - although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers
   loomed large and close, as if both near and distant, according to some
   abnormal geometry.

   The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the
   clerical garb of the Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty
   years old, with a sallow, olive complexion and fairly good features,
   but an abnormally high forehead. His black hair was well cut and neatly
   brushed, and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy
   growth of beard. He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows. His build
   and lower facial features were like other clergymen I had seen, but he
   had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more
   intelligent-looking - also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking. At
   the present moment - having just lighted a faint oil lamp - he looked
   nervous, and before I knew it he was casting all his magical books into
   a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted
   sharply) which I had not noticed before. The flames devoured the
   volumes greedily - leaping up in strange colors and emitting
   indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and
   wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element. All at once I saw
   there were others in the room - grave-looking men in clerical costume,
   one of whom wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop. Though I
   could hear nothing, I could see that they were bringing a decision of
   vast import to the first-comer. They seemed to hate and fear him at the
   same time, and he seemed to return these sentiments. His face set
   itself into a grim expression, but I could see his right hand shaking
   as he tried to grip the back of a chair. The bishop pointed to the
   empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down amidst
   a charred, non-committal mass), and seemed filled with a peculiar
   loathing. The first-comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with
   his left hand toward the small object on the table. Everyone then
   seemed frightened. The procession of clerics began filing down the
   steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor, turning and making
   menacing gestures as they left. The bishop was last to go.

   The first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room
   and extracted a coil of rope. Mounting a chair, he attached one end of
   the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak, and
   began making a noose with the other end. Realizing he was about to hang
   himself, I started forward to dissuade or save him. He saw me and
   ceased his preparations, looking at me with a kind of triumph which
   puzzled and disturbed me. He slowly stepped down from the chair and
   began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark,
   thin-lipped face.

   I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector
   as a weapon of defense. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know.
   I turned it on - full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow
   first with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of
   wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear
   - which did not, however, wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in
   his tracks - then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to
   stagger backwards. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in
   the floor, and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In
   another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was
   lost to view.

   I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get
   there I found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a
   clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal
   silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as
   normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this
   place. Had there been a noise I had not heard?

   Presently the two people (simple villagers, apparently) farthest in the
   lead saw me - and stood paralyzed. One of them shrieked loudly and
   reverberantly:

   "Ahrrh!  . . . It be'ee, zur? Again?"

   Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When
   the crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to
   this place - standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me
   gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to
   ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic. He spoke:

   "So you didn't let it alone! I'm sorry. I know what has happened. It
   happened once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You
   ought not to have made him come back. You know what he wants. But you
   mustn't get frightened like the other man he got. Something very
   strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn't get far enough
   to hurt your mind and personality. If you'll keep cool, and accept the
   need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can
   keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship.
   But you can't live here - and I don't think you'll wish to go back to
   London. I'd advise America.

   "You mustn't try anything more with that-- thing. Nothing can be put
   back now. It would only make matters worse to do - or summon -
   anything. You are not as badly off as you might be - but you must get
   out of here at once and stay away. You'd better thank Heaven it didn't
   go further . . .

   "I'm going to prepare you as bluntly as I can. There's been a certain
   change - in your personal appearance. He always causes that. But in a
   new country you can get used to it. There's a mirror up at the other
   end of the room, and I'm going to take you to it. You'll get a shock -
   though you will see nothing repulsive."

   I was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to
   hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint
   lamp (i.e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern
   he had brought) in his free hand. This is what I saw in the glass:

   A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the
   Anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed
   glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height.

   It was the silent first-comer who had burned his books.

   For all the rest of my life, in outward form, I was to be that man!

   Efficiunt Daemones, ut quae non sunt, sic tamen quasi sint,
   conspicienda hominibus exhibeant.
   (Devils so work that things which are not appear to men as if they were
   real.)

   --Lactantius

   I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In
   the twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just
   over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing
   sky and the first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called
   me to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen
   snow along the road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled
   among the trees; on toward the very ancient town I had never seen but
   often dreamed of.

   It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their
   hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and
   mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea
   town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when
   festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to
   keep festival once every century, that the memory of primal secrets
   might not be forgotten. Mine were an old people, and were old even when
   this land was settled three hundred years before. And they were
   strange, because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate
   southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another tongue before they
   learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers. And now they were
   scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living
   could understand. I was the only one who came back that night to the
   old fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and the lonely
   remember.

   Then beyond the hill's crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the
   gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples,
   ridgepoles and chimney-pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees
   and graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets,
   and dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch;
   ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles
   and levels like a child's disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey
   wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and
   small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join
   Orion and the archaic stars. And against the rotting wharves the sea
   pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come
   in the elder time.

   Beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and
   windswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black
   gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed
   fingernails of a gigantic corpse. The printless road was very lonely,
   and sometimes I thought I heard a distant horrible creaking as of a
   gibbet in the wind. They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft
   in 1692, but I did not know just where.

   As the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry
   sounds of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought
   of the season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have
   Christmas customs strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer.
   So after that I did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers,
   kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls
   to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt
   breeze, and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along
   deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little, curtained windows.

   I had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my
   people. It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village
   legend lives long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle Court,
   and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the
   town, to where Green Lane leads off behind the Market House. The old
   maps still held good, and I had no trouble; though at Arkham they must
   have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place, since I saw
   not a wire overhead. Snow would have hid the rails in any case. I was
   glad I had chosen to walk, for the white village had seemed very
   beautiful from the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door of my
   people, the seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an ancient
   peaked roof and jutting second storey, all built before 1650.

   There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from
   the diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its
   antique state. The upper part overhung the narrow grass-grown street
   and nearly met the over-hanging part of the house opposite, so that I
   was almost in a tunnel, with the low stone doorstep wholly free from
   snow. There was no sidewalk, but many houses had high doors reached by
   double flights of steps with iron railings. It was an odd scene, and
   because I was strange to New England I had never known its like before.
   Though it pleased me, I would have relished it better if there had been
   footprints in the snow, and people in the streets, and a few windows
   without drawn curtains.

   When I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear
   had been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my
   heritage, and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the
   silence in that aged town of curious customs. And when my knock was
   answered I was fully afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps
   before the door creaked open. But I was not afraid long, for the
   gowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that
   reassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a
   quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried.

   He beckoned me into a low, candle-lit room with massive exposed rafters
   and dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past
   was vivid there, for not an attribute was missing. There was a
   cavernous fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in
   loose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me, silently
   spinning despite the festive season. An indefinite dampness seemed upon
   the place, and I marvelled that no fire should be blazing. The
   high-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and
   seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did not like everything
   about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This fear grew
   stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I looked at the
   old man's bland face the more its very blandness terrified me. The eyes
   never moved, and the skin was too much like wax. Finally I was sure it
   was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask. But the flabby
   hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the tablet and told me I
   must wait a while before I could be led to the place of the festival.

   Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the
   room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and
   mouldy, and that they included old Morryster's wild Marvels of Science,
   the terrible Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvil, published in
   1681, the shocking Daemonolatreja of Remigius, printed in 1595 at
   Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab
   Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius' forbidden Latin translation; a book
   which I had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things
   whispered. No one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs
   in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old
   woman continued her silent spinning, spinning. I thought the room and
   the books and the people very morbid and disquieting, but because an
   old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings, I
   resolved to expect queer things. So I tried to read, and soon became
   tremblingly absorbed by something I found in that accursed
   Necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or
   consciousness, but I disliked it when I fancied I heard the closing of
   one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been stealthily
   opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old
   woman's spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old woman
   was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking. After
   that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was
   reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and
   dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so
   that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the
   blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When eleven struck,
   however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive carved chest in a
   corner, and got two hooded cloaks; one of which he donned, and the
   other of which he draped round the old woman, who was ceasing her
   monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer door; the
   woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book
   I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving
   face or mask.

   We went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly
   ancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows
   disappeared one by one, and the Dog Star leered at the throng of
   cowled, cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and
   formed monstrous processions up this street and that, past the creaking
   signs and antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs and diamond-paned
   windows; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped
   and crumbled together; gliding across open courts and churchyards where
   the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations.

   Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by
   elbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and
   stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and
   hearing never a word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I saw
   that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of
   focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the
   town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it from the road's
   crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had made me
   shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the
   ghostly spire.

   There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with
   spectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of
   snow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having
   peaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs,
   revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows.
   Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the
   hill's summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the
   town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a lantern bobbed
   horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng
   that was now slipping speechlessly into the church. I waited till the
   crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till all the stragglers had
   followed. The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but I was determined to
   be the last. Crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown
   darkness, I turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard
   phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement. And as I
   did so I shuddered. For though the wind had not left much snow, a few
   patches did remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting
   backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of
   passing feet, not even mine.

   The church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it,
   for most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the
   aisle between the high pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned
   loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and were now squirming
   noiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the foot-worn steps and into the
   dark, suffocating crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of
   night-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into a
   venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed that the
   tomb's floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding, and in
   a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of rough-hewn
   stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous, that
   wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls
   of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar. It was a silent,
   shocking descent, and I observed after a horrible interval that the
   walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiselled out of the
   solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made
   no sound and set up no echoes. After more aeons of descent I saw some
   side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to
   this shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they became excessively numerous,
   like impious catacombs of nameless menace; and their pungent odour of
   decay grew quite unbearable. I knew we must have passed down through
   the mountain and beneath the earth of Kingsport itself, and I shivered
   that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil.

   Then I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious
   lapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the
   things that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no
   forefather had summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and the
   passage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery
   of a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the
   boundless vista of an inner world--a vast fungous shore litten by a
   belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river
   that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest
   gulfs of immemorial ocean.

   Fainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan
   toadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs
   forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite,
   older than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the
   solstice and of spring's promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire and
   evergreen, light and music. And in the stygian grotto I saw them do the
   rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the water
   handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in
   the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously
   squatted far away from the light, piping noisomely on a flute; and as
   the thing piped I thought I heard noxious muffled flutterings in the
   foetid darkness where I could not see. But what frightened me most was
   that flaming column; spouting volcanically from depths profound and
   inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame should, and coating
   the nitrous stone with a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all that
   seething combustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess of death and
   corruption.

   The man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the
   hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semi-circle he
   faced. At certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance,
   especially when he held above his head that abhorrent Necronomicon he
   had taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had been
   summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then the
   old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the darkness,
   which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder
   drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable
   and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth,
   transfixed with a dread not of this or any world, but only of the mad
   spaces between the stars.

   Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that
   cold flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river
   rolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a
   horde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could
   ever wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not
   altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats,
   nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not
   recall. They flopped limply along, half with their webbed feet and half
   with their membranous wings; and as they reached the throng of
   celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode off one
   by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and
   galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and
   undiscoverable cataracts.

   The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man
   remained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an
   animal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that
   the amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the
   beasts were patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man produced
   his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my
   fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient place; that it
   had been decreed I should come back, and that the most secret mysteries
   were yet to be performed. He wrote this in a very ancient hand, and
   when I still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a
   watch, both with my family arms, to prove that he was what he said. But
   it was a hideous proof, because I knew from old papers that that watch
   had been buried with my great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698.

   Presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family
   resemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that
   the face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were
   now scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the old man
   was nearly as restless himself. When one of the things began to waddle
   and edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of
   his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his
   head. And then, because that nightmare's position barred me from the
   stone staircase down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily
   underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea; flung
   myself into that putrescent juice of earth's inner horrors before the
   madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions
   these pest-gulfs might conceal.

   At the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport
   Harbour at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to
   save me. They told me I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the
   night before, and fallen over the cliffs at Orange Point; a thing they
   deduced from prints found in the snow. There was nothing I could say,
   because everything was wrong. Everything was wrong, with the broad
   windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was
   ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below.
   They insisted that this was Kingsport, and I could not deny it. When I
   went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old
   churchyard on Central Hill, they sent me to St Mary's Hospital in
   Arkham, where I could have better care. I liked it there, for the
   doctors were broad-minded, and even lent me their influence in
   obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred's objectionable
   Necronomicon from the library of Miskatonic University. They said
   something about a "psychosis" and agreed I had better get any harassing
   obsessions off my mind.

   So I read that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was
   indeed not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell what
   they might; and where it was I had seen it were best forgotten. There
   was no one--in waking hours--who could remind me of it; but my dreams
   are filled with terror, because of phrases I dare not quote. I dare
   quote only one paragraph, put into such English as I can make from the
   awkward Low Latin.

   "The nethermost caverns," wrote the mad Arab, "are not for the
   fathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific.
   Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and
   evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say,
   that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at
   night whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of old rumour that the
   soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and
   instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life
   springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and
   swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are digged where
   earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that
   ought to crawl."

   12049A GardenH. P. Lovecraft

   There's an ancient, ancient garden that I see sometimes in dreams,
   Where the very Maytime sunlight plays and glows with spectral gleams;
   Where the gaudy-tinted blossoms seem to wither into grey,
   And the crumbling walls and pillars waken thoughts of yesterday.
   There are vines in nooks and crannies, and there's moss about the pool,
   And the tangled weedy thicket chokes the arbour dark and cool:
   In the silent sunken pathways springs an herbage sparse and spare,
   Where the musty scent of dead things dulls the fragrance of the air.
   There is not a living creature in the lonely space around,
   And the hedge~encompass'd quiet never echoes to a sound.
   As I walk, and wait, and listen, I will often seek to find
   When it was I knew that garden in an age long left behind;
   I will oft conjure a vision of a day that is no more,
   As I gaze upon the grey, grey scenes I feel I knew before.
   Then a sadness settles o'er me, and a tremor seems to start -
   For I know the flow'rs are shrivell'd hopes - the garden is my heart.

   (INTRODUCTORY NOTE: The following very singular narrative, or record of
   impressions, was discovered under circumstances so extraordinary that
   they deserve careful description. On the evening of Wednesday, August
   27, 1913, at about eight-thirty o'clock, the population of the small
   seaside village of Potowonket, Maine, U.S.A., was aroused by a
   thunderous report accompanied by a blinding flash; and persons near the
   shore beheld a mammoth ball of fire dart from the heavens into the sea
   but a short distance out, sending up a prodigious column of water. The
   following Sunday a fishing party composed of John Richmond, Peter B.
   Carr, and Simon Canfield, caught in their trawl and dragged ashore a
   mass of metallic rock, weighing 360 pounds, and looking (as Mr.
   Canfield said) like a piece of slag. Most of the inhabitants agreed
   that this heavy body was none other than the fireball which had fallen
   from the sky four days before; and Dr. Richard M. Jones, the local
   scientific authority, allowed that it must be an aerolite or meteoric
   stone. In chipping off specimens to send to an expert Boston analyst,
   Dr. Jones discovered imbedded in the semi-metallic mass the strange
   book containing the ensuing tale, which is still in his possession.
         In form the discovery resembles an ordinary note-book, about 5 X
   3 inches in size, and containing thirty leaves. In material, however it
   presents marked peculiarities. The covers are apparently of some dark
   stony substance unknown to geologists, and unbreakable by any
   mechanical means. No chemical reagent seems to act upon them. The
   leaves are much the same, save that they are lighter in colour, and so
   infinitely thin as to be quite flexible. The whole is bound by some
   process not very clear to those who have observed it; a process
   involving the adhesion of the leaf substance to the cover substance.
   These substances cannot now be separated, nor can the leaves be torn by
   any amount of force. The writing is Greek of the purest classical
   quality, and several students of palaeography declare that the
   characters are in a cursive hand used about the second century B. C.
   There is little in the text to determine the date. The mechanical mode
   of writing cannot be deduced beyond the fact that it must have
   resembled that of the modern slate and slate-pencil. During the course
   of analytical efforts made by the late Professor Chambers of Harvard,
   several pages, mostly at the conclusion of the narrative, were blurred
   to the point of utter effacement before being read; a circumstance
   forming a well-nigh irreparable loss. What remains of the contents was
   done into modern Greek letters by the palaeographer, Rutherford, and in
   this form submitted to the translators.
         Professor Mayfield of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
   who examined samples of the strange stone, declares it a true
   meteorite; an opinion in which Dr. von Winterfeldt of Heidelberg
   (interned in 1918 as a dangerous enemy alien) does not concur.
   Professor Bradley of Columbia College adopts a less dogmatic ground;
   pointing out that certain utterly unknown ingredients are present in
   large quantities, and warning that no classification is as yet
   possible.
         The presence, nature, and message of the strange book form so
   momentous a problem, that no explanation can even be attempted. The
   text, as far as preserved, is here rendered as literally as our
   language permits, in the hope that some reader may eventually hit upon
   an interpretation and solve one of the greatest scientific mysteries of
   recent years.)
   It was a narrow place, and I was alone. On one side, beyond a margin of
   vivid waving green, was the sea; blue; bright, and billowy, and
   send-ing up vaporous exhalations which intoxicated me. So profuse,
   indeed, were these exhalations, that they gave me an odd impression of
   a coales-cence of sea and sky; for the heavens were likewise bright and
   blue. On the other side was the forest, ancient almost as the sea
   itself, and stretch-ing infinitely inland. It was very dark, for the
   trees were grotesquely huge and luxuriant, and incredibly numerous.
   Their giant trunks were of a horrible green which blended weirdly with
   the narrow green tract whereon I stood. At some distance away, on
   either side of me, the strange forest extended down to the water's
   edge, obliterating the shore line and completely hemming in the narrow
   tract. Some of the trees, I observed, stood in the water itself; as
   though impatient of any barrier to their progress.
         I saw no living thing, nor sign that any living thing save myself
   had ever existed. The sea and the sky and the wood encircled me, and
   reached off into regions beyond my imagination. Nor was there any sound
   save of the wind-tossed wood and of the sea.
         As I stood in this silent place, I suddenly commenced to tremble;
   for though I knew not how I came there, and could scarce remember what
   my name and rank had been, I felt that I should go mad if I could
   understand what lurked about me. I recalled things I had learned,
   things I had dreamed, things I had imagined and yearned for in some
   other distant life. I thought of long nights when I had gazed up at the
   stars of heaven and cursed the gods that my free soul could not
   traverse the vast abysses which were inaccessible to my body. I
   conjured up ancient blasphemies, and terrible delvings into the papri
   of Democritus; but as memories appeared, I shuddered in deeper fear,
   for I knew that I was alone - horribly alone. Alone, yet close to
   sentient impulses of vast, vague kind; which I prayed never to
   comprehend nor encounter. In the voice of the swaying green branches I
   fancied I could detect a kind of malignant hatred and demoniac triumph.
   Sometimes they struck me as being in horrible colloquy with ghastly and
   unthinkable things which the scaly green bodies of the trees half-hid;
   hid from sight but not from consciousness. The most oppressive of my
   sensations was a sinister feeling of alienage. Though I saw about me
   objects which I could name; trees, grass, sea, and sky; I felt that
   their relation to me was not the same as that of the trees, grass, sea,
   and sky I knew in another and dimly remembered life. The nature of the
   difference I could not tell, yet I shook in stark fright as it
   impressed itself upon me.
         And then, in a spot where I had before discerned nothing but the
   misty sea, I beheld the Green Meadow; separated from me by a vast
   expanse of blue rippling water with suntipped wavelets, yet strangely
   near. Often I would peep fearfully over my right shoulder at the trees,
   but I preferred to look at the Green Meadow, which affected me oddly.
         It was while my eyes were fixed upon this singular tract, that I
   first felt the ground in motion beneath me. Beginning with a kind of
   throbbing agitation which held a fiendish suggestion of conscious
   action, the bit of bank on which I stood detached itself from the
   grassy shore and commenced to float away; borne slowly onward as if by
   some current of resistless force. I did not move, astonished and
   startled as I was by the unprecedented phenomenon; but stood rigidly
   still until a wide lane of water yawned betwixt me and the land of
   trees. Then I sat down in a sort of daze, and again looked at the
   sun-tipped water and the Green Meadow.
         Behind me the trees and the things they may have been hiding
   seemed to radiate infinite menace. This I knew without turning to view
   them, for as I grew more used to the scene I became less and less
   depen-dent upon the five senses that once had been my sole reliance. I
   knew the green scaly forest hated me, yet now I was safe from it, for
   my bit of bank had drifted far from the shore.
         But though one peril was past, another loomed up before me.
   Pieces of earth were constantly crumbling from the floating isle which
   held me, so that death could not be far distant in any event. Yet even
   then I seemed to sense that death would be death to me no more, for I
   turned again to watch the Green Meadow, imbued with a curious feeling
   of security in strange contrast to my general horror.
         Then it was that I heard, at a distance immeasurable, the sound
   of falling water. Not that of any trival cascade such as I had known,
   but that which might be heard in the far Scythian lands if all the
   Mediterranean were poured down an unfathomable abyss. It was toward
   this sound that my shrinking island was drifting, yet I was content.
         Far in the rear were happening weird and terrible things; things
   which I turned to view, yet shivered to behold. For in the sky dark
   vaporous forms hovered fantastically, brooding over trees and seeming
   to answer the challenge of the waving green branches. Then a thick mist
   arose from the sea to join the sky-forms, and the shore was erased from
   my sight. Though the sun - what sun I knew not - shone brightly on the
   water around me, the land I had left seemed involved in a demoniac
   tempest where dashed the will of the hellish trees and what they hid,
   with that of the sky and the sea. And when the mist vanished, I saw
   only the blue sky and the blue sea, for the land and the trees were no
   more.
         It was at this point that my attention was arrested by the
   singing in the Green Meadow. Hitherto, as I have said, I had
   encountered no sign of human life; but now there arose to my ears a
   dull chant whose origin and nature were apparently unmistakable. While
   the words were utterly undistinguishable, the chant awaked in me a
   peculiar train of associations; and I was reminded of some vaguely
   disquieting lines I had once translated out of an Egyptian book, which
   in turn were taken from a papyrus of ancient Meroe. Through my brain
   ran lines that I fear to repeat; lines telling of very antique things
   and forms of life in the days when our earth was exceeding young. Of
   things which thought and moved and were alive, yet which gods and men
   would not consider alive. It was a strange book.
         As I listened, I became gradually conscious of a circumstance
   which had before puzzled me only subconsciously. At no time had my
   sight distinguished any definite objects in the Green Meadow, an
   impression of vivid homogeneous verdure being the sum total of my
   perception. Now, however, I saw that the current would cause my island
   to pass the shore at but a little distance; so that I might learn more
   of the land and of the singing thereon. My curiosity to behold the
   singers had mounted high, though it was mingled with apprehension.
         Bits of sod continued to break away from the tiny tract which
   carried me, but I heeded not their loss; for I felt that I was not to
   die with the body (or appearance of a body) which I seemed to possess.
   That everything about me, even life and death, was illusory; that I had
   overleaped the bounds of mortality and corporeal entity, becoming a
   free, detached thing; impressed me as almost certain. Of my location I
   knew nothing, save that I felt I could not be on the earth-planet once
   so familiar to me. My sensations, apart from a kind of haunting terror,
   were those of a traveller just embarked upon an unending voyage of
   discovery. For a moment I thought of the lands and persons I had left
   behind; and of strange ways whereby I might some day tell them of my
   adventurings, even though I might never return.
         I had now floated very near the Green Meadow, so that the voices
   were clear and distinct; but though I knew many languages I could not
   quite interpret the words of the chanting. Familiar they indeed were,
   as I had subtly felt when at a greater distance, but beyond a sensation
   of vague and awesome remembrance I could make nothing of them. A most
   extraordinary quality in the voices-a quality which I cannot
   describe-at once frightened and fascinated me. My eyes could now
   discern several things amidst the omnipresent verdure-rocks, covered
   with I bright green moss, shrubs of considerable height, and less
   definable shapes of great magnitude which seemed to move or vibrate
   amidst the shrubbery in a peculiar way. The chanting, whose authors I
   was so anxious to glimpse, seemed loudest, at points where these shapes
   were most numerous and most vigorously in motion.

   And then, as my island drifted closer and the sound of the distant
   waterfall grew louder, I saw clearly the source of the chanting, and in
   one horrible instant remembered everything. Of such things I cannot,
   dare not tell, for therein was revealed the hideous solution of all
   which had puzzled me; and that solution would drive you mad, even as it
   al-most drove me.... I knew now the change through which I had passed,
   and through which certain others who once were men had passed! and I
   knew the endless cycle of the future which none like me may escape... I
   shall live forever, be conscious forever, though my soul cries out to
   the gods for the boon of death and oblivion... All is before me: beyond
   the deafening torrent lies the land of Stethelos, where young men are
   infinitely old... The Green Meadow... I will send a message across the
   horrible immeasurable abyss....

   The Haunter of the Dark

   I have seen the dark universe yawning
   Where the black planets roll without aim,
   Where they roll in their horror unheeded,
   Without knowledge or lustre or name.

   --Nemesis.

   Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief
   that Robert Blake was killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous
   shock derived from an electrical discharge. It is true that the window
   he faced was unbroken, but nature has shown herself capable of many
   freakish performances. The expression on his face may easily have
   arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw,
   while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic
   imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old
   matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the
   deserted church of Federal Hill--the shrewd analyst is not slow in
   attributing them to some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at
   least some of which Blake was secretly connected.

   For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to
   the field of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his
   quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier
   stay in the city--a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to
   occult and forbidden lore as he--had ended amidst death and flame, and
   it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his
   home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old stories despite his
   statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped
   in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection.

   Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this
   evidence, there remain several who cling to less rational and
   commonplace theories. They are inclined to take much of Blake's diary
   at its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such as the
   undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the verified existence
   of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the
   recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named Edwin M.
   Lillibridge in 1893, and--above all--the look of monstrous,
   transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died. It was
   one of these believers who, moved to fanatical extremes, threw into the
   bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box
   found in the old church steeple--the black windowless steeple, and not
   the tower where Blake's diary said those things originally were. Though
   widely censured both officially and unofficially, this man--a reputable
   physician with a taste for odd folklore--averred that he had rid the
   earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it.

   Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself.
   The papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle,
   leaving for others the drawing of the picture as Robert Blake saw
   it--or thought he saw it--or pretended to see it. Now studying the
   diary closely, dispassionately, and at leisure, let us summarize the
   dark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief
   actor.

   Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking the
   upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College
   Street--on the crest of the great eastward hill near the Brown
   University campus and behind the marble John Hay Library. It was a cosy
   and fascinating place, in a little garden oasis of village-like
   antiquity where huge, friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient
   shed. The square Georgian house had a monitor roof, classic doorway
   with fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks of
   early nineteenth century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors,
   wide floor-boards, a curving colonial staircase, white Adam-period
   mantels, and a rear set of rooms three steps below the general level.

   Blake's study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden
   on one side, while its west windows--before one of which he had his
   desk--faced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view
   of the lower town's outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that
   flamed behind them. On the far horizon were the open countryside's
   purple slopes. Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral
   hump of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose
   remote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms as the
   smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious
   sense that he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might
   or might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter
   it in person.

   Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique
   furniture suitable for his quarters and settled down to write and
   paint--living alone, and attending to the simple housework himself. His
   studio was in a north attic room, where the panes of the monitor roof
   furnished admirable lighting. During that first winter he produced five
   of his best-known short stories--"The Burrower Beneath", "The Stairs in
   the Crypt", "Shaggai", "In the Vale of Pnath", and "The Feaster from
   the Stars"--and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhuman
   monsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.

   At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the
   outspread west--the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below, the
   Georgian court-house belfry, the lofty pinnacles of the downtown
   section, and that shimmering, spire-crowned mound in the distance whose
   unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy.
   From his few local acquaintances he learned that the far-off slope was
   a vast Italian quarter, though most of the houses were remnants of
   older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would train his
   field-glasses on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling
   smoke; picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples, and
   speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house.
   Even with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous,
   and linked to the unreal, intangible marvels of Blake's own tales and
   pictures. The feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into
   the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house floodlights and
   the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night
   grotesque.

   Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church
   most fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at
   certain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering
   steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on
   especially high ground; for the grimy façade, and the obliquely seen
   north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows,
   rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and
   chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of
   stone, stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and
   more. The style, so far as the glass could show, was that earliest
   experimental form of Gothic revival which preceded the stately Upjohn
   period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the
   Georgian age. Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815.

   As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with
   an oddly mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted,
   he knew that it must be vacant. The longer he watched, the more his
   imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious things. He
   believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the
   place, so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves.
   Around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of
   birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what he thought
   and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends,
   but none of them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the
   faintest notion of what the church was or had been.

   In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his
   long-planned novel--based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in
   Maine--but was strangely unable to make progress with it. More and more
   he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and
   the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate
   leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new
   beauty, but Blake's restlessness was merely increased. It was then that
   he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that
   fabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.

   Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made
   his first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown
   streets and the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the
   ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and
   blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known,
   unreachable world beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white
   street signs which meant nothing to him, and presently he noted the
   strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs over
   curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he
   find any of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he
   half fancied that the Federal Hill of that distant view was a
   dream-world never to be trod by living human feet.

   Now and then a battered church façade or crumbling spire came in sight,
   but never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper
   about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head, though he
   spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher, the region seemed
   stranger and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys
   leading eternally off to the south. He crossed two or three broad
   avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower. Again he asked
   a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this time he could
   have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man's face
   had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a
   curious sign with his right hand.

   Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his
   left, above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly
   alleys. Blake knew at once what it was, and plunged toward it through
   the squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice he lost
   his way, but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or
   housewives who sat on their doorsteps, or any of the children who
   shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes.

   At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone
   bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in a
   wind-swept open square, quaintly cobblestoned, with a high bank wall on
   the farther side. This was the end of his quest; for upon the wide,
   iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which the wall supported--a separate,
   lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streets--there
   stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despite Blake's new
   perspective, was beyond dispute.

   The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high
   stone buttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost
   among the brown, neglected weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows
   were largely unbroken, though many of the stone mullions were missing.
   Blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so
   well, in view of the known habits of small boys the world over. The
   massive doors were intact and tightly closed. Around the top of the
   bank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty iron fence whose
   gate--at the head of a flight of steps from the square--was visibly
   padlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely
   overgrown. Desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place, and
   in the birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of
   the dimly sinister beyond his power to define.

   There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at
   the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church.
   He was a great wholesome Irishman, and it seemed odd that he would do
   little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people
   never spoke of that building. When Blake pressed him he said very
   hurriedly that the Italian priest warned everybody against it, vowing
   that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark. He
   himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled
   certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood.

   There had been a bad sect there in the old days--an outlaw sect that
   called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a
   good priest to exorcise what had come, though there did be those who
   said that merely the light could do it. If Father O'Malley were alive
   there would be many a thing he could tell. But now there was nothing to
   do but let it alone. It hurt nobody now, and those that owned it were
   dead or far away. They had run away like rats after the threatening
   talk in '77, when people began to mind the way folks vanished now and
   then in the neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in and take the
   property for lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody's
   touching it. Better it be left alone for the years to topple, lest
   things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss.

   After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled
   pile. It excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to
   others as to him, and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind
   the old tales the bluecoat had repeated. Probably they were mere
   legends evoked by the evil look of the place, but even so, they were
   like a strange coming to life of one of his own stories.

   The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed
   unable to light up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that
   towered on its high plateau. It was odd that the green of spring had
   not touched the brown, withered growths in the raised, iron-fenced
   yard. Blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining
   the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress. There
   was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be
   resisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but round on the
   north side were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk
   round on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap.
   If the people feared the place so wildly, he would encounter no
   interference.

   He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone
   noticed him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square
   edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the
   shopkeeper in the avenue had made. Several windows were slammed down,
   and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children
   inside a rickety, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy
   to pass through, and before long Blake found himself wading amidst the
   rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here and there the worn
   stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in the
   field; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer bulk
   of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he
   conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the
   façade. All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the
   Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening.
   Even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of
   desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on
   automatically.

   A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the
   needed aperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and
   dust faintly litten by the western sun's filtered rays. Debris, old
   barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye,
   though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp
   outlines. The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace showed that the
   building had been used and kept in shape as late as mid-Victorian
   times.

   Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the
   window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn
   concrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions;
   and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black
   archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of
   oppression at being actually within the great spectral building, but
   kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about--finding a still-intact
   barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide
   for his exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide,
   cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half-choked with the
   omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached
   and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness.
   He had no light, but groped carefully with his hands. After a sharp
   turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little fumbling revealed its
   ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined
   corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling.

   Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All
   the inner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to
   room. The colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its driffs
   and mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hour-glass pulpit, and
   sounding-board and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the
   pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic
   columns. Over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light
   as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange,
   half-blackened panes of the great apsidal windows.

   The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake
   could scarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little
   he could make out he did not like them. The designs were largely
   conventional, and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much
   concerning some of the ancient patterns. The few saints depicted bore
   expressions distinctly open to criticism, while one of the windows
   seemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity
   scattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blake noticed
   that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind,
   but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.

   In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and
   ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the
   first time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the
   titles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden
   things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard
   of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded
   repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have
   trickled down the stream of time from the days of man's youth, and the
   dim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them--a
   Latin version of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis,
   the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the
   Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn's hellish
   De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he had known merely by
   reputation or not at all--the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan,
   and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable characters yet with
   certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognizable to the occult
   student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place
   had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the
   known universe.

   In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with
   entries in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing
   consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and
   anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts--the devices of
   the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs--here massed in
   solid pages of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that
   each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter.

   In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume
   in his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated
   him unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time.
   He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long. Was he
   the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly
   sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors?

   Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again
   through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he
   had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened
   tower and steeple--objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The
   ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders
   had done their worst in this constricted place. The staircase was a
   spiral with high, narrow wooden treads, and now and then Blake passed a
   clouded window looking dizzily out over the city. Though he had seen no
   ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower
   whose narrow, louvre-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied
   so often. Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained
   the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and
   clearly devoted to vastly different purposes.

   The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet
   windows, one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of
   decayed louvre-boards. These had been further fitted with tight, opaque
   screens, but the latter were now largely rotted away. In the centre of
   the dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four
   feet in height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with
   bizarre, crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs. On this
   pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged
   lid thrown back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the
   decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object
   some four inches through. Around the pillar in a rough circle were
   seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind
   them, ranging along the dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images
   of crumbling, black-painted plaster, resembling more than anything else
   the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious Easter Island. In one corner
   of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall, leading up
   to the closed trap door of the windowless steeple above.

   As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs
   on the strange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to
   clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the
   figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting
   entities which, though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form
   ever evolved on this planet. The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to
   be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat
   surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an
   artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did
   not touch the bottom of the box, but was held suspended by means of a
   metal band around its centre, with seven queerly-designed supports
   extending horizontally to angles of the box's inner wall near the top.
   This stone, once exposed, exerted upon Blake an almost alarming
   fascination. He could scarcely tear his eyes from it, and as he looked
   at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent, with
   half-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floated pictures of
   alien orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains
   and no mark of life, and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in
   vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will.

   When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of
   dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took
   his attention he could not tell, but something in its contours carried
   a message to his unconscious mind. Ploughing toward it, and brushing
   aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something
   grim about it. Hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake
   gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions. It was a human skeleton,
   and it must have been there for a very long time. The clothing was in
   shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man's grey
   suit. There were other bits of evidence--shoes, metal clasps, huge
   buttons for round cuffs, a stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter's
   badge with the name of the old Providence Telegram, and a crumbling
   leather pocketbook. Blake examined the latter with care, finding within
   it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid advertising calendar
   for 1893, some cards with the name "Edwin M. Lillibridge", and a paper
   covered with pencilled memoranda.

   This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully
   at the dim westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases
   as the following:

     Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844--buys old Free-Will
     Church in July--his archaeological work & studies in occult well

     that no human being has entered church since 1877.

   Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his
   coat, Blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust. The
   implications of the notes were clear, and there could be no doubt but
   that this man had come to the deserted edifice forty-two years before
   in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold
   enough to attempt. Perhaps no one else had known of his plan--who could
   tell? But he had never returned to his paper. Had some
   bravely-suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden
   heart-failure? Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their
   peculiar state. Some of them were badly scattered, and a few seemed
   oddly dissolved at the ends. Others were strangely yellowed, with vague
   suggestions of charring. This charring extended to some of the
   fragments of clothing. The skull was in a very peculiar state--stained
   yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid
   had eaten through the solid bone. What had happened to the skeleton
   during its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not
   imagine.

   Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting
   its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw
   processions of robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and
   looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching
   monoliths. He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea, and
   vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin
   shimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond all else he glimpsed an
   infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semisolid forms were known
   only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to
   superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes
   and arcana of the worlds we know.

   Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing,
   indeterminate panic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone,
   conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him
   with horrible intentness. He felt entangled with something--something
   which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at
   him--something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that
   was not physical sight. Plainly, the place was getting on his
   nerves--as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was
   waning, too, and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would
   have to be leaving soon.

   It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint
   trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried to look
   away from it, but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back. Was there
   a subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing? What was it
   that the dead man's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron?
   What, anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? What had been
   done here, and what might still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows?
   It seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere
   close by, though its source was not apparent. Blake seized the cover of
   the long-open box and snapped it down. It moved easily on its alien
   hinges, and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stone.

   At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come
   from the steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door.
   Rats, without question--the only living things to reveal their presence
   in this accursed pile since he had entered it. And yet that stirring in
   the steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly
   down the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted
   basement, out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, and
   down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal
   Hill towards the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks
   of the college district.

   During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition.
   Instead, he read much in certain books, examined long years of
   newspaper files downtown, and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in
   that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon
   saw, was no simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt
   sure that its language could not be English, Latin, Greek, French,
   Spanish, Italian, or German. Evidently he would have to draw upon the
   deepest wells of his strange erudition.

   Every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned, and he saw
   the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant
   and half-fabulous world. But now it held a fresh note of terror for
   him. He knew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with the
   knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways. The birds of spring
   were returning, and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they
   avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before. When a flock of them
   approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic
   confusion--and he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to
   reach him across the intervening miles.

   It was in June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the
   cryptogram. The text was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by
   certain cults of evil antiquity, and known to him in a halting way
   through previous researches. The diary is strangely reticent about what
   Blake deciphered, but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his
   results. There are references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing
   into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the black
   gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken of as
   holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of
   Blake's entries show fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as
   summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the streetlights form a
   bulwark which cannot be crossed.

   Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on
   all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was
   fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to
   earth. It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid
   things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of
   Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human
   beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with
   Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to
   swarthy merchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built
   around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused
   his name to be stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept
   in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh
   destroyed, till the delver's spade once more brought it forth to curse
   mankind.

   Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake's entries, though
   in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general
   attention to their contribution. It appears that a new fear had been
   growing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded
   church. The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings
   and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple, and called on their
   priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams. Something, they
   said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough
   to venture forth. Press items mentioned the longstanding local
   superstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background
   of the horror. It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no
   antiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses
   a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining
   Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight
   into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time, however, he displays
   the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid
   longing--pervading even his dreams--to visit the accursed tower and
   gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.

   Then something in the Journal on the morning of 17 July threw the
   diarist into a veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the
   other half-humorous items about the Federal hill restlessness, but to
   Blake it was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm
   had put the city's lighting-system out of commission for a full hour,
   and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with
   fright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing
   in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps' absence and
   gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a
   viscous, altogether dreadful way. Towards the last it had bumped up to
   the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass. It could
   go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it
   fleeing.

   When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in
   the tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the
   grime-blackened, louvre-boarded windows was too much for the thing. It
   had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in
   time--for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss
   whence the crazy stranger had called it. During the dark hour praying
   crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles
   and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas--a guard of
   light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness.
   Once, those nearest the church declared, the outer door had rattled
   hideously.

   But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake
   read of what the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical
   news value of the scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds
   of Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after
   trying the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule and of
   the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, with bits of rotted
   cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around. There was a
   bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain and
   patches of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower,
   and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they
   found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.

   In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They
   spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and
   the bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough the metal box and
   the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned. What disturbed Blake the
   most--except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours--was
   the final detail that explained the crashing glass. Every one of the
   tower's lancet windows was broken, and two of them had been darkened in
   a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pew-linings and
   cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior
   louvre-boards. More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay
   scattered around the newly swept floor, as if someone had been
   interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness
   of its tightly curtained days.

   Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the
   windowless spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the
   horizontally-sliding trap-door and shot a feeble flashlight beam into
   the black and strangely foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and
   a heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture. The
   verdict, of course, was charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on the
   superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic had striven to
   bolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps some of
   the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate
   hoax on the outside world. There was an amusing aftermath when the
   police sent an officer to verify the reports. Three men in succession
   found ways of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very
   reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given
   by the reporters.

   From this point onwards Blake's diary shows a mounting tide of
   insidious horror and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not
   doing something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of another
   electrical breakdown. It had been verified that on three
   occasions--during thunderstorms--he telephoned the electric light
   company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against
   a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries show concern over
   the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the
   strangely marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower
   room. He assumed that these things had been removed--whither, and by
   whom or what, he could only guess. But his worst fears concerned
   himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his
   mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple--that monstrous
   thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black
   spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and callers
   of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and
   stare out of the west window at that far-off spire-bristling mound
   beyond the swirling smoke of the city. His entries dwell monotonously
   on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the unholy
   rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awakened to
   find himself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down
   College Hill towards the west. Again and again he dwells on the fact
   that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.

   The week following 30 July is recalled as the time of Blake's partial
   breakdown. He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone.
   Visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed, and he said that
   sleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots
   which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying.
   In his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the
   collapse. After retiring on the night of the 30th, he had suddenly
   found himself groping about in an almost black space. All he could see
   were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could
   smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive
   sounds above him. Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at
   each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from above--a
   vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.

   Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top,
   whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built
   into the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some
   region of intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against
   him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played,
   all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast,
   unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even
   profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate
   Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of
   All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous
   dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute
   held in nameless paws.

   Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and
   roused him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he
   never knew--perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard
   all summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron
   saints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event
   he shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled
   blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber
   that encompassed him.

   He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow
   spiral staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There
   was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly
   arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless scramble
   through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street
   lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering
   gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and up the
   steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.

   On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his
   study floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch
   of his body seemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw
   that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour
   seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his
   nerves broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a
   dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west window, shiver at
   the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.

   The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August. Lightning
   struck repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable
   fireballs were reported. The rain was torrential, while a constant
   fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was
   utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to
   telephone the company around 1 A.M. though by that time service had
   been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety. He recorded
   everything in his diary--the large, nervous, and often undecipherable,
   hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and
   of entries scrawled blindly in the dark.

   He had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window, and it
   appears that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously
   through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the
   constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he
   would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases
   such as "The lights must not go"; "It knows where I am"; "I must
   destroy it"; and "it is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury
   this time"; are found scattered down two of the pages.

   Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2.12 A.M.
   according to power-house records, but Blake's diary gives no indication
   of the time. The entry is merely, "Lights out--God help me." On Federal
   Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men
   paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with
   umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns,
   crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern
   Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs
   of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the
   flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether. A rising wind blew
   out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly dark.
   Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened
   to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could.
   Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower, there could
   be no doubt whatever.

   For what happened at 2.35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young,
   intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monohan
   of the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had
   paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of
   the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church's high bank
   wall--especially those in the square where the eastward façade was
   visible. Of course there was nothing which can be proved as being
   outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such an event are
   many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes
   arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of
   heterogeneous contents. Mephitic vapours--spontaneous
   combustion--pressure of gases born of long decay--any one of numberless
   phenomena might be responsible. And then, of course, the factor of
   conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded. The thing was really
   quite simple in itself, and covered less than three minutes of actual
   time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at his watch
   repeatedly.

   It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside
   the black tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of
   strange, evil odours from the church, and this had now become emphatic
   and offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a
   large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning
   easterly façade. The tower was invisible now that the candles would not
   burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was
   the smoke-grimed louvre-boarding of that tower's east window.

   Immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from
   the unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and
   almost prostrating those in the square. At the same time the air
   trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden
   east-blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the
   hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas from the crowd. Nothing
   definite could be seen in the candleless night, though some
   upward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur
   of denser blackness against the inky sky--something like a formless
   cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed towards the east.

   That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and
   discomfort, and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at
   all. Not knowing what had happened, they did not relax their vigil; and
   a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated
   lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded
   heavens. Half an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes
   more the street lights sprang on again, sending the weary, bedraggled
   watchers relievedly back to their homes.

   The next day's papers gave these matters minor mention in connection
   with the general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash
   and deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were
   even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor
   was likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill,
   where the crash awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a
   bewildered round of speculations. Of those who were already awake only
   a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or
   noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the
   leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was
   agreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere
   in this neighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could afterwards
   be found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a
   grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary
   flash burst, but his observation has not been verified. All of the few
   observers, however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the
   flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke, whilst
   evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is
   equally general.

   These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable
   connection with the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta
   house, whose upper rear windows looked into Blake's study, noticed the
   blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth,
   and wondered what was wrong with the expression. When they saw the same
   face in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched
   for the lights to come up in his apartment. Later they rang the bell of
   the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.

   The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the
   intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark,
   convulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened
   dismay. Shortly afterwards the coroner's physician made an examination,
   and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous
   tension induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death. The
   hideous expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a not improbable
   result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such
   abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter
   qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in the
   apartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the
   desk. Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the
   broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically
   contracted right hand.

   The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and
   legible only in part. From them certain investigators have drawn
   conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict,
   but such speculations have little chance for belief among the
   conservative. The case of these imaginative theorists has not been
   helped by the action of superstitious Doctor Dexter, who threw the
   curious box and angled stone--an object certainly self-luminous as seen
   in the black windowless steeple where it was found--into the deepest
   channel of Narragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and neurotic
   unbalance on Blake's part, aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone
   cult whose startling traces he had uncovered, form the dominant
   interpretation given those final frenzied jottings. These are the
   entries--or all that can be made of them:

     Lights still out--must be five minutes now. Everything depends on
     lightning. Yaddith grant it will keep up! . . . Some influence seems
     beating through it . . . Rain and thunder and wind deafen . . . The
     thing is taking hold of my mind . . .

     Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before. Other worlds
     and other galaxies . . . Dark . . . The lightning seems dark and the
     darkness seems light . . .

     It cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the
     pitch-darkness. Must be retinal impression left by flashes. Heaven
     grant the Italians are out with their candles if the lightning
     stops!

     What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in
     antique and shadowy Khem even took the form of man? I remember
     Yuggoth, and more distant Shaggai, and the ultimate void of the
     black planets . . .

     The long, winging flight through the void . . . cannot cross the
     universe of light . . . re-created by the thoughts caught in the
     Shining Trapezohedron . . . send it through the horrible abysses of
     radiance . . .

     My name is Blake--Robert Harrison Blake of 620 East Knapp Street,
     Milwaukee, Wisconsin . . . I am on this planet . . .

     Azathoth have mercy!--the lightning no longer flashes--horrible--I
     can see everything with a monstrous sense that is not sight--light
     is dark and dark is light . . . those people on the hill . . .
     guard . . . candles and charms . . . their priests . . .

     Sense of distance gone--far is near and near is far. No light--no
     glass--see that steeple--that tower--window--can hear--Roderick
     Usher--am mad or going mad--the thing is stirring and fumbling in
     the tower.

     I am it and it is I--I want to get out . . . must get out and unify
     the forces . . . it knows where I am . . .

     I am Robert Blake, but I see the tower in the dark. There is a
     monstrous odour . . . senses transfigured . . . boarding at that
     tower window cracking and giving way . . . Iä . . . ngai . . .
     ygg . . .

     I see it--coming here--hell-wind--titan blur--black wing--Yog
     Sothoth save me--the three-lobed burning eye . . .

   1364033The Hoard of The Wizarrd-Beastby H. P. Lovecraft and R. H.
   Barlow1933

   There had happened in the teeming and many-towered city of Zeth one of
   those incidents which are prone to take place in all capitals of all
   worlds. Nor, simply because Zeth lies on a planet of strange beasts and
   stranger vegetation, did this incident differ greatly from what might
   have occurred in London or Paris or any of the great governing towns we
   know. Through the cleverly concealed dishonesty of an aged but shrewd
   official, the treasury was exhausted. No shining phrulder, as of old,
   lay stacked about the strong-room; and over empty coffers the sardonic
   spider wove webs of mocking design. When, at last, the giphath Yalden
   entered that obscure vault and discovered the thefts, there were left
   only some phlegmatic rats which peered sharply at him as at an alien
   intruder.

   There had been no accountings since Kishan the old keeper had died many
   moon-turns before, and great was Yalden's dismay to find this emptiness
   instead of the expected wealth. The indifference of the small creatures
   in the cracks between the flagstones could not spread itself to him.
   This was a very grave matter, and would have to be met in a very prompt
   and serious way. Clearly, there was nothing to do but consult Oorn, and
   Oorn was a highly portentous being.

   Oorn, though a creature of extremely doubtful nature, was the virtual
   ruler of Zeth. It obviously belonged somewhere in the outer abyss, but
   had blundered into Zeth one night and suffered capture by the shamith
   priests. The coincidence of Its excessively bizarre aspect and Its
   innate gift of mimicry had impressed the sacred brothers as offering
   vast possibilities, hence in the end they had set It up as a god and an
   oracle, organising a new brotherhood to serve It--and incidentally to
   suggest the edicts it should utter and the replies It should give. Like
   the Delphi and Dodona of a later world, Oorn grew famous as a giver of
   judgments and solver of riddles; nor did Its essence differ from them
   save that It lay infinitely earlier in Time, and upon an elder world
   where all things might happen. And now Yalden, being not above the
   credulousness of his day and planet, had set out for the close-guarded
   and richly-fitted hall wherein Oorn brooded and mimicked the promptings
   of the priests.

   When Yalden came within sight of the Hall, with its tower of blue tile,
   he became properly religious, and entered the building acceptably, in a
   humble manner which greatly impeded progress. According to custom, the
   guardians of the deity acknowledged his obeisance and pecuniary
   offering, and retired behind heavy curtains to ignite the thuribles.
   After everything was in readiness, Yalden murmured a conventional
   prayer and bowed low before a curious empty dais studded with exotic
   jewels. For a moment--as the ritual prescribed--he stayed in this
   abased position, and when he arose the dais was no longer empty.
   Unconcernedly munching something the priests had given It was a large
   pudgy creature very hard to describe, and covered with short grey fur.
   Whence It had come in so brief a time only the priests might tell, but
   the suppliant knew that It was Oorn.

   Hesitantly Yalden stated his unfortunate mission and asked advice;
   weaving into his discourse the type of flattery which seemed to him
   most discreet. Then, with anxiety, he awaited the oracle's response.
   Having tidily finished Its food, Oorn raised three small reddish eyes
   to Yalden and uttered certain words in a tone of vast decisiveness:
   "Gumay ere hfotuol leheht teg." After this It vanished suddenly in a
   cloud of pink smoke which seemed to issue from behind the curtain where
   the acolytes were. The acolytes then came forth from their hiding-place
   and spoke to Yalden, saying: "Since you have pleased the deity with
   your concise statement of a very deplorable state of affairs, we are
   honored by interpreting its directions. The aphorism you heard
   signifies no less than the equally mystic phrase `Go thou unto thy
   destination' or more properly speaking, you are to slay the
   monster-wizard Anathas, and replenish the treasury with its fabled
   hoard."

   With this Yalden was dismissed from the temple. It may not be said in
   veracity that he was fearless, for in truth, he was openly afraid of
   the monster Anathas, as were all the inhabitants of Ullathia and the
   surrounding land. Even those who doubted its actuality would not have
   chosen to reside in the immediate neighborhood of the Cave of Three
   Winds wherein it was said to dwell.

   But the prospect was not without romantic appeal, and Yalden was young
   and consequently unwise. He knew, among other things, that there was
   always the hope of rescuing some feminine victim of the monster's famed
   and surprising erotic taste. Of the true aspect of Anathas none could
   be certain; tales of a widely opposite nature being commonly
   circulated. Many vowed it had been seen from afar in the form of a
   giant black shadow peculiarly repugnant to human taste, while others
   alleged it was a mound of gelatinous substance that oozed hatefully in
   the manner of putrescent flesh. Still others claimed they had seen it
   as a monstrous insect with astonishing supernumerary appurtenances. But
   in one thing all coincided; namely, that it was advisable to have as
   little traffic as possible with Anathas.

   With due supplications to his gods and to their messenger Oorn, Yalden
   set out for the Cave of Three Winds. In his bosom were mixed an
   ingrained, patriotic sense of duty, and a thrill of adventurous
   expectancy regarding the unknown mysteries he faced. He had not
   neglected such preparations as a sensible man might make, and a wizard
   of old repute had furnished him with certain singular accessories. He
   had, for example, a charm which prevented his thirsting or hungering,
   and wholly did away with his need for provisions. There was likewise a
   glistening cape to counteract the evil emanations of a mineral that lay
   scattered over the rocky ground along his course. Other warnings and
   safeguards dealt with certain gaudy land-crustaceans, and with the
   deathly-sweet mists which arise at certain points until dispersed by
   heliotropism.

   Thus shielded, Yalden fared without incident until he came to the place
   of the White Worm. Here of necessity he delayed to make preparations
   for finding the rest of his way. With patient diligence he captured the
   small colorless maggot, and surrounded it with a curious mark made with
   green paint. As was prophesied, the Lord of Worms, whose name was
   Sarall, made promise of certain things in return for its freedom. Then
   Yalden released it, and it crawled away after directing him on the
   course he was to follow.

   The sere and fruitless land through which he now travelled was totally
   uninhabited. Not even the hardier of the beasts were to be seen beyond
   the edge of that final plateau which separated him from his goal. Far
   off, in a purplish haze, rose the mountains amidst which dwelt Anathas.
   It lived not solitary, despite the lonely region around, for strange
   pets resided with it--some the fabled elder monsters, and others unique
   beings created by its own fearful craft.

   At the heart of its cave, legend said, Anathas had concealed an
   enormous hoard of jewels, gold, and other things of fabulous value. Why
   so potent a wonder-worker should care for such gauds, or revel in the
   counting of money, was by no means clear; but many things attested the
   truth of these tastes. Great numbers of persons of stronger will and
   wit than Yalden had died in remarkable manners while seeking the hoard
   of the wizard-beast, and their bones were laid in a strange pattern
   before the mouth of the cave, as a warning to others.

   When, after countless vicissitudes, Yalden came at last into sight of
   the Cave of Winds amid the glistening boulders, he knew indeed that
   report had not lied concerning the isolation of Anathas' lair. The
   cavern-mouth was well-concealed, and over everything an ominous quiet
   lowered. There was no trace of habitation, save of course the ossuary
   ornamentation in the front yard. With his hand on the sword that had
   been sanctified by a priest of Oorn, Yalden tremblingly advanced. When
   he had attained the very opening of the lair, he hesitated no longer,
   for it was evident that the monster was away.

   Deeming this the best of all times to prosecute his business, Yalden
   plunged at once within the cave. The interior was very cramped and
   exceedingly dirty, but the roof glittered with an innumerable array of
   small, varicoloured lights, the source of which was not to be
   perceived. In the rear yawned another opening, either natural or
   artificial; and to this black, low-arched burrow Yalden hastened,
   crawling within it on hands and knees. Before long a faint blue
   radiance glowed at the farther end, and presently the searcher emerged
   into an ampler space. Straightening up, he beheld a most singular
   change in his surroundings. This second cavern was tall and domed as if
   it had been shapen by supernatural powers, and a soft blue and silver
   light infused the gloom. Anathas, thought Yalden, lived indeed in
   comfort; for this room was finer than anything in the Palace of Zeth,
   or even in the Temple of Oorn, upon which had been lavished unthinkable
   wealth and beauty. Yalden stood agape, but not for long, since he
   desired most of all to seek the object of his quest and depart before
   Anathas should return from wherever it might be. For Yalden did not
   wish to encounter the monster-sorcerer of which so many tales were
   told. Leaving therefore this second cave by a narrow cleft which he
   saw, the seeker followed a devious and unlit way far down through the
   solid rock of the plateau. This, he felt, would take him to that third
   and ultimate cavern where his business lay. As he progressed, he
   glimpsed ahead of him a curious glow; and at last, without warning, the
   walls receded to reveal a vast open space paved solidly with blazing
   coals above which flapped and shrieked an obscene flock of
   wyvern-headed birds. Over the fiery surface green monstrous salamanders
   slithered, eyeing the intruder with malignant speculation. And on the
   far side rose the stairs of a metal dais, encrusted with jewels, and
   piled high with precious objects; the hoard of the wizard-beast.

   At sight of this unattainable wealth, Yalden's fervour well-nigh
   overcame him; and chaffing at his futility, he searched the sea of
   flame for some way of crossing. This, he soon perceived, was not
   readily to be found; for in all that glowing crypt there was only a
   slight crescent of flooring near the entrance which a mortal man might
   hope to walk on. Desperation, however, possessed him; so that at last
   he resolved to risk all and try the fiery pavement. Better to die in
   the quest than to return empty-handed. With teeth set, he started
   toward the sea of flame, heedless of what might follow.

   As it was, surprise seared him almost as vehemently as he had expected
   the flames to do--for with his advance, the glowing floor divided to
   form a narrow lane of safe cool earth leading straight to the golden
   throne. Half dazed, and heedless of whatever might underlie such
   curiously favouring magic, Yalden drew his sword and strode boldly
   betwixt the walls of flame that rose from the rifted pavement. The heat
   hurt him not at all, and the wyvern-creatures drew back, hissing, and
   did not molest him.

   The hoard now glistened close at hand, and Yalden thought of how he
   would return to Zeth, laden with fabulous spoils and worshipped by
   throngs as a hero. In his joy he forgot to wonder at Anathas' lax care
   of its treasures; nor did the very friendly behaviour of the fiery
   pavement seem in any way remarkable. Even the huge arched opening
   behind the dais, so oddly invisible from across the cavern, failed to
   disturb him seriously. Only when he had mounted the broad stair of the
   dais and stood ankle-deep amid the bizarre golden reliques of other
   ages and other worlds, and the lovely, luminous gems from unknown mines
   and of unknown natures and meanings, did Yalden begin to realise that
   anything was wrong.

   But now he perceived that the miraculous passage through the flaming
   floor was closing again, leaving him marooned on the dais with the
   glittering treasure he had sought. And when it had fully closed, and
   his eyes had circled round vainly for some way of escape, he was hardly
   reassured by the shapeless jelly-like shadow which loomed colossal and
   stinking in the great archway behind the dais. He was not permitted to
   faint, but was forced to observe that this shadow was infinitely more
   hideous than anything hinted in any popular legend, and that its seven
   iridescent eyes were regarding him with placid amusement.

   Then Anathas the wizard-beast rolled fully out of the archway, mighty
   in necromantic horror, and jested with the small frightened conqueror
   before allowing that horde of slavering and peculiarly hungry green
   salamanders to complete their slow, anticipatory ascent of the dais.

   I have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the
   horror at Martin's Beach. Despite the large number of witnesses, no two
   accounts agree; and the testimony taken by local authorities contains
   the most amazing discrepancies.

   Perhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheard-of character of
   the horror itself, the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it, and
   the efforts made by the fashionable Wavecrest Inn to hush it up after
   the publicity created by Prof. Ahon's article "Are Hypnotic Powers
   Confined to Recognized Humanity?"

   Against all these obstacles I am striving to present a coherent
   version; for I beheld the hideous occurrence, and believe it should be
   known in view of the appalling possibilities it suggests. Martin's
   Beach is once more popular as a watering-place, but I shudder when I
   think of it. Indeed, I cannot look at the ocean at all now without
   shuddering.

   Fate is not always without a sense of drama and climax, hence the
   terrible happening of August 8, 1922, swiftly followed a period of
   minor and agreeably wonder-fraught excitement at Martin's Beach. On May
   17 the crew of the fishing smack Alma of Gloucester, under Capt. James
   P. Orne, killed, after a battle of nearly forty hours, a marine monster
   whose size and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific
   circles and caused certain Boston naturalists to take every precaution
   for its taxidermic preservation.

   The object was some fifty feet in length, of roughly cylindrical shape,
   and about ten feet in diameter. It was unmistakably a gilled fish in
   its major affiliations; but with certain curious modifications such as
   rudimentary forelegs and six-toed feet in place of pectoral fins, which
   prompted the widest speculation. Its extraordinary mouth, its thick and
   scaly hide, and its single, deep-set eye were wonders scarcely less
   remarkable than its colossal dimensions; and when the naturalists
   pronounced it an infant organism, which could not have been hatched
   more than a few days, public interest mounted to extraordinary heights.

   Capt. Orne, with typical Yankee shrewdness, obtained a vessel large
   enough to hold the object in its hull, and arranged for the exhibition
   of his prize. With judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an
   excellent marine museum, and, sailing south to the wealthy resort
   district of Martin's Beach, anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a
   harvest of admission fees.

   The intrinsic marvelousness of the object, and the importance which it
   clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and
   far, combined to make it the season's sensation. That it was absolutely
   unique - unique to a scientifically revolutionary degree - was well
   understood. The naturalists had shown plainly that it radically
   differed from the similarly immense fish caught off the Florida coast;
   that, while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths,
   perhaps thousands of feet, its brain and principal organs indicated a
   development startlingly vast, and out of all proportion to anything
   hitherto associated with the fish tribe.

   On the morning of July 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of
   the vessel and its strange treasure. In the storm of the preceding
   night it had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the
   sight of man, carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite
   the threatening weather. Capt. Orne, backed by extensive scientific
   interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from Gloucester,
   made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise, but with no result
   other than the prompting of interest and conversation. By August 7 hope
   was abandoned, and Capt. Orne had returned to the Wavecrest Inn to wind
   up his business affairs at Martin's Beach and confer with certain of
   the scientific men who remained there. The horror came on August 8.

   It was in the twilight, when grey sea-birds hovered low near the shore
   and a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters.
   The scene is important to remember, for every impression counts. On the
   beach were several strollers and a few late bathers; stragglers from
   the distant cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the
   north, or from the adjacent cliff-perched Inn whose imposing towers
   proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeur.

   Well within viewing distance was another set of spectators, the
   loungers on the Inn's high-ceiled and lantern-lighted veranda, who
   appeared to be enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom
   inside. These spectators, who included Capt. Orne and his group of
   scientific confreres, joined the beach group before the horror
   progressed far; as did many more from the Inn. Certainly there was no
   lack of witnesses, confused though their stories be with fear and doubt
   of what they saw.

   There is no exact record of the time the thing began, although a
   majority say that the fairly round moon was "about a foot" above the
   low-lying vapors of the horizon. They mention the moon because what
   they saw seemed subtly connected with it - a sort of stealthy,
   deliberate, menacing ripple which rolled in from the far skyline along
   the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams, yet which seemed to subside
   before it reached the shore.

   Many did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events; but it
   seems to have been very marked, differing in height and motion from the
   normal waves around it. Some called it cunning and calculating. And as
   it died away craftily by the black reefs afar out, there suddenly came
   belching up out of the glitter-streaked brine a cry of death; a scream
   of anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked it.

   First to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty;
   sturdy fellows in white bathing attire, with their calling proclaimed
   in large red letters across their chests. Accustomed as they were to
   rescue work, and to the screams of the drowning, they could find
   nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation; yet with a trained sense
   of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their
   usual course.

   Hastily seizing an air-cushion, which with its attached coil of rope
   lay always at hand, one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the
   scene of the gathering crowd; whence, after whirling it about to gain
   momentum, he flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which
   the sound had come. As the cushion disappeared in the waves, the crowd
   curiously awaited a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been
   so great; eager to see the rescue made by the massive rope.

   But that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter;
   for, pull as they might on the rope, the two muscular guards could not
   move the object at the other end. Instead, they found that object
   pulling with equal or even greater force in the very opposite
   direction, till in a few seconds they were dragged off their feet and
   into the water by the strange power which had seized on the proffered
   life-preserver.

   One of them, recovering himself, called immediately for help from the
   crowd on the shore, to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope; and in
   a moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men, among whom
   Capt. Orne was foremost. More than a dozen strong hands were now
   tugging desperately at the stout line, yet wholly without avail.

   Hard as they tugged, the strange force at the other end tugged harder;
   and since neither side relaxed for an instant, the rope became rigid as
   steel with the enormous strain. The struggling participants, as well as
   the spectators, were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the
   nature of the force in the sea. The idea of a drowning man had long
   been dismissed; and hints of whales, submarines, monsters, and demons
   now passed freely around. Where humanity had first led the rescuers,
   wonder kept them at their task; and they hauled with a grim
   determination to uncover the mystery.

   It being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the
   air-cushion, Capt. Orne, as a natural leader, shouted to those on shore
   that a boat must be obtained in order to approach, harpoon, and land
   the unseen leviathan. Several men at once prepared to scatter in quest
   of a suitable craft, while others came to supplant the captain at the
   straining rope, since his place was logically with whatever boat party
   might be formed. His own idea of the situation was very broad, and by
   no means limited to whales, since he had to do with a monster so much
   stranger. He wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an
   adult of the species of which the fifty-foot creature had been the
   merest infant.

   And now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact
   which changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror, and
   dazed with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers. Capt.
   Orne, turning to leave his post at the rope, found his hands held in
   their place with unaccountable strength; and in a moment he realized
   that he was unable to let go of the rope. His plight was instantly
   divined, and as each companion tested his own situation the same
   condition was encountered. The fact could not be denied - every
   struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the
   hempen line which was slowly, hideously, and relentlessly pulling them
   out to sea.

   Speechless horror ensued; a horror in which the spectators were
   petrified to utter inaction and mental chaos. Their complete
   demoralization is reflected in the conflicting accounts they give, and
   the sheepish excuses they offer for their seemingly callous inertia. I
   was one of them, and know.

   Even the strugglers, after a few frantic screams and futile groans,
   succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in
   the face of unknown powers. There they stood in the pallid moonlight,
   blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously
   backward and forward as the water rose first to their knees, then to
   their hips. The moon went partly under a cloud, and in the half-light
   the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede,
   writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping death.

   Harder and harder grew the rope, as the tug in both directions
   increased, and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the
   rising waves. Slowly the tide advanced, till the sands so lately
   peopled by laughing children and whispering lovers were now swallowed
   by the inexorable flow. The herd of panic-stricken watchers surged
   blindly backward as the water crept above their feet, while the
   frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on, half submerged, and
   now at a substantial distance from their audience. Silence was
   complete.

   The crowd, having gained a huddling-place beyond reach of the tide,
   stared in mute fascination; without offering a word of advice or
   encouragement, or attempting any kind of assistance. There was in the
   air a nightmare fear of impending evils such as the world had never
   before known.

   Minutes seemed lengthened into hours, and still that human snake of
   swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide. Rhythmically it
   undulated; slowly, horribly, with the seal of doom upon it. Thicker
   clouds now passed over the ascending moon, and the glittering path on
   the waters faded nearly out.

   Very dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads, with now and
   then the livid face of a backward-glancing victim gleaming pale in the
   darkness. Faster and faster gathered the clouds, till at length their
   angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame. Thunders rolled,
   softly at first, yet soon increasing to a deafening, maddening
   intensity. Then came a culminating crash - a shock whose reverberations
   seemed to shake land and sea alike - and on its heels a cloudburst
   whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the
   heavens themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrent.

   The spectators, instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious
   and coherent thought, now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel
   veranda. Rumors had reached the guests inside, so that the refugees
   found a state of terror nearly equal to their own. I think a few
   frightened words were uttered, but cannot be sure.

   Some, who were staying at the Inn, retired in terror to their rooms;
   while others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of
   bobbing heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning
   flashes. I recall thinking of those heads, and the bulging eyes they
   must contain; eyes that might well reflect all the fright, panic, and
   delirium of a malignant universe - all the sorrow, sin, and misery,
   blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires, fear, loathing and anguish of
   the ages since time's beginning; eyes alight with all the soul-racking
   pain of eternally blazing infernos.

   And as I gazed out beyond the heads, my fancy conjured up still another
   eye; a single eye, equally alight, yet with a purpose so revolting to
   my brain that the vision soon passed. Held in the clutches of an
   unknown vise, the line of the damned dragged on; their silent screams
   and unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and
   the night-wind.

   There now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic
   sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed. Amidst a blinding
   glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the
   blasphemies of hell, and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated
   in one apocalyptic, planet-rending peal of Cyclopean din. It was the
   end of the storm, for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the
   moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted sea.

   There was no line of bobbing heads now. The waters were calm and
   deserted, and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a
   whirlpool far out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry
   had first come. But as I looked along that treacherous lane of silvery
   sheen, with fancy fevered and senses overwrought, there trickled upon
   my ears from some abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of
   a laugh.

     "There are sacraments of evil as well as of good about us, and we
     live and move to my belief in an unknown world, a place where there
     are caves and shadows and dwellers in twilight. It is possible that
     man may sometimes return on the track of evolution, and it is my

   Heald1937

   When the state highway to Rutland is closed, travellers are forced to
   take the Stillwater road past Swamp Hollow. The scenery is superb in
   places, yet somehow the route has been unpopular for years. There is
   something depressing about it, especially near Stillwater itself.
   Motorists feel subtly uncomfortable about the tightly shuttered
   farmhouse on the knoll just north of the village, and about the
   white-bearded half-wit who haunts the old burying-ground on the south,
   apparently talking to the occupants of some of the graves.

   Not much is left of Stillwater, now. The soil is played out, and most
   of the people have drifted to the towns across the distant river or to
   the city beyond the distant hills. The steeple of the old white church
   has fallen down, and half of the twenty-odd straggling houses are empty
   and in various stages of decay. Normal life is found only around Peck's
   general store and filling-station, and it is here that the curious stop
   now and then to ask about the shuttered house and the idiot who mutters
   to the dead.

   Most of the questioners come away with a touch of distaste and
   disquiet. They find the shabby loungers oddly unpleasant and full of
   unnamed hints in speaking of the long-past events brought up. There is
   a menacing, portentous quality in the tones which they use to describe
   very ordinary events--a seemingly unjustified tendency to assume a
   furtive, suggestive, confidential air, and to fall into awesome
   whispers at certain points--which insidiously disturbs the listener.
   Old Yankees often talk like that; but in this case the melancholy
   aspect of the half-mouldering village, and the dismal nature of the
   story unfolded, give these gloomy, secretive mannerisms an added
   significance. One fells profoundly the quintessential horror that lurks
   behind the isolated Puritan and his strange repressions--feels it, and
   longs to escape precipitately into clearer air.

   The loungers whisper impressively that the shuttered house is that of
   old Miss Sprague--Sophie Sprague, whose brother Tom was buried on the
   seventeenth of June, back in '86. Sophie was never the same after that
   funeral--that and the other thing which happened the same day--and in
   the end she took to staying in all the time. Won't even be seen now,
   but leaves notes under the back-door mat and has her things brought
   from the store by Ned Peck's boy. Afraid of something--the old Swamp
   Hollow burying-ground most of all. Never could be dragged near there
   since her brother--and the other one--were laid away. Not much wonder,
   though, seeing the way crazy Johnny Dow rants. He hangs around the
   burying-ground all day and sometimes at night, and claims he talks with
   Tom--and the other. Then he marches by Sophie's house and shouts things
   at her--that's why she began to keep the shutters closed. He says
   things are coming from somewhere to get her sometime. Ought to be
   stopped, but one can't be too hard on poor Johnny. Besides, Steve
   Barbour always had his opinions.

   Johnny does his talking to two of the graves. One of them is Tom
   Sprague's. The other, at the opposite end of the graveyard, is that of
   Henry Thorndike, who was buried on the same day. Henry was the village
   undertaker--the only one in miles--and never liked around Stillwater. A
   city fellow from Rutland--been to college and full of book learning.
   Read queer things nobody else ever heard of, and mixed chemicals for no
   good purpose. Always trying to invent something new--some new-fangled
   embalming-fluid or some foolish kind of medicine. Some folds said he
   had tried to be a doctor but failed in his studies and took to the next
   best profession. Of course, there wasn't much undertaking to do in a
   place like Stillwater, but Henry farmed on the side.

   Mean, morbid disposition--and a secret drinker if you could judge by
   the empty bottles in his rubbish heap. No wonder Tom Sprague hated him
   and blackballed him from the Masonic lodge, and warned him off when he
   tried to make up to Sophie. The way he experimented on animals was
   against Nature and Scripture. Who could forget the state that collie
   dog was found in, or what happened to old Mrs. Akeley's cat? Then there
   was the matter of Deacon Leavitt's calf, when Tom had led a band of the
   village boys to demand an accounting. The curious thing was that the
   calf came alive after all in the end, though Tom had found it as stiff
   as a poker. Some said the joke was on Tom, but Thorndike probably
   thought otherwise, since he had gone down under his enemy's fist before
   the mistake was discovered.

   Tom, of course, was half drunk at the time. He was a vicious brute at
   best, and kept his poor sister half cowed with threats. That's probably
   why she is such a fear-racked creature still. There were only the two
   of them, and Tom would never let her leave because that meant splitting
   the property. Most of the fellows were too afraid of him to shine up to
   Sophie--he stood six feet one in his stockings--but Henry Thorndike was
   a sly cuss who had ways of doing things behind folk's backs. He wasn't
   much to look at, but Sophie never discouraged him any. Mean and ugly as
   he was, she'd have been glad if anybody could have freed her from her
   brother. She may not have stopped to wonder how she could get clear of
   him after he got her clear of Tom.

   Well, that was the way things stood in June of '86. Up to this point,
   the whispers of the loungers at Peck's store are not to unbearably
   portentous; but as they continue, the element of secretiveness and
   malign tension grows. Tom Sprague, it appears, used to go to Rutland on
   periodic sprees, his absences being Henry Thorndike's great
   opportunities. He was always in bad shape when he got back, and old Dr.
   Pratt, deaf and half blind though he was, used to warn him about his
   heart, and about the danger of delirium tremens. Folks could always
   tell by the shouting and cursing when he was home again.

   It was on the ninth of June--on a Wednesday, the day after young Joshua
   Goodenough finished building his new-fangled silo--that Tom started out
   on his last and longest spree. He came back the next Tuesday morning
   and folks at the store saw him lashing his bay stallion the way he did
   when whiskey had a hold of him. Then there came shouts and shrieks and
   oaths from the Sprague house, and the first thing anybody knew Sophie
   was running over to old Dr. Pratt's at top speed.

   The doctor found Thorndike at Sprague's when he got there, and Tom was
   on the bed in his room, with eyes staring and foam around his mouth.
   Old Pratt fumbled around and gave the usual tests, then shook his head
   solemnly and told Sophie she had suffered a great bereavement--that her
   nearest and dearest had passed through the pearly gates to a better
   land, just as everybody knew he would if he didn't let up on his
   drinking.

   Sophie kind of sniffled, but didn't seem to take on much. Thorndike
   didn't do anything but smile--perhaps at the ironic fact that he,
   always an enemy, was now the only person who could be of any use to
   Thomas Sprague. He shouted something in old Dr. Pratt's half-good ear
   about the need of having the funeral early on account of Tom's
   condition. Drunks like that were always doubtful subjects, and any
   extra delay--with merely rural facilities--would entail consequences,
   visual and otherwise, hardly acceptable to the deceased's loving
   mourners. The doctor had muttered that Tom's alcoholic career ought to
   have embalmed him pretty well in advance, but Thorndike assured him to
   the contrary, at the same time boasting of his own skill, and of the
   superior methods he had devised through his experiments.

   It is here that the whispers of the loungers grow acutely disturbing.
   Up to this point the story is usually told by Ezra Davenport, or Luther
   Fry, if Ezra is laid up with chilblains, as he is apt to be in winter;
   but from there on old Calvin Wheeler takes up the thread, and his voice
   has a damnably insidious way of suggesting hidden horror. If Johnny Dow
   happens to be passing by there is always a pause, for Stillwater does
   not like to have Johnny talk too much with strangers.

   Calvin edges close to the traveller and sometimes seizes a coat-lapel
   with his gnarled, mottled hand while he half shuts his watery blue
   eyes.

   "Well, sir," he whispers, "Henry he went home an' got his undertaker's
   fixin's--crazy Johnny Dow lugged most of 'em, for he was always doin'
   chores for Henry--an' says as Doc Pratt an' crazy Johnny should help
   lay out the body. Doc always did say as how he thought Henry talked too
   much--a-boastin' what a fine workman he was, an' how lucky it was that
   Stillwater had a reg'lar undertaker instead of buryin' folks jest as
   they was, like they do over to Whitby.

   "'Suppose,' says he, 'some fellow was to be took with some of them
   paralysin' cramps like you read about. How'd a body like it when they
   lowered him down and begun shovelin' the dirt back? How'd he like it
   when he was chokin' down there under the new headstone, scratchin' an'
   tearin' if he chanced to get back the power, but all the time knowin'
   it wasn't no use? No, sir, I tell you it's a blessin' Stillwater's got
   a smart doctor as knows when a man's dead and when he ain't, and a
   trained undertaker who can fix a corpse so he'll stay put without no
   trouble.'

   "That was the way Henry went on talkin', most like he was talkin' to
   poor Tom's remains; and old Doc Pratt he didn't like what he was able
   to catch of it, even though Henry did call him a smart doctor. Crazy
   Johnny kept watchin' of the corpse, and it didn't make it none too
   pleasant the way he'd slobber about things like, 'He ain't cold, Doc,'
   or 'I see his eyelids move,' or 'There's a hole in his arm jest like
   the ones I git when Henry gives me a syringe full of what makes me feel
   good.' Thorndike shut him up on that, though we all knowed he'd been
   givin' poor Johnny drugs. It's a wonder the poor fellow ever got clear
   of the habit.

   "But the worst thing, accordin' to the doctor, was the way the body
   jerked up when Henry began to shoot it full of embalmin'-fluid. He'd
   been boastin' about what a fine new formula he'd got practicin' on cats
   and dogs, when all of a sudden Tom's corpse began to double up like it
   was alive and fixin' to wrassle. Land of Goshen, but Doc says he was
   scared stiff, though he knowed the way corpses act when the muscles
   begin to stiffen. Well, sir, the long and short of it is, that the
   corpse sat up an' grabbed a holt of Thorndike's syringe so that it got
   stuck in Henry hisself, an' give him as neat a dose of his own
   embalmin'-fluid as you'd wish to see. That got Henry pretty scared,
   though he yanked the point out and managed to get the body down again
   and shot full of the fluid. He kept measurin' more of the stuff out as
   though he wanted to be sure there was enough, and kept reassurin'
   himself as not much had got into him, but crazy Johnny begun singin'
   out, 'That's what you give Lige Hopkins's dog when it got all dead an'
   stiff an' then waked up agin. Now you're a-going to get dead an' stiff
   like Tom Sprague be! Remember it don't set to work till after a long
   spell if you don't get much.'

   "Sophie, she was downstairs with some of the neighbours--my wife
   Matildy, she that's dead an' gone this thirty year, was one of them.
   They were all tryin' to find out whether Thorndike was over when Tom
   came home, and whether findin' him there was what set poor Tom off. I
   may as well say as some folks thought it mighty funny that Sophie
   didn't carry on more, nor mind the way Thorndike had smiled. Not as
   anybody was hintin' that Henry helped Tom off with some of his queer
   cooked-up fluids and syringes, or that Sophie would keep still if she
   thought so--but you know how folks will guess behind a body's back. We
   all knowed the nigh crazy way Thorndike had hated Tom--not without
   reason, at that--and Emily Barbour says to my Matildy as how Henry was
   lucky to have ol' Doc Pratt right on the spot with a death certificate
   as didn't leave no doubt for nobody."

   When old Calvin gets to this point he usually begins to mumble
   indistinguishably in his straggling, dirty white beard. Most listeners
   try to edge away from him, and he seldom appears to heed the gesture.
   It is generally Fred Peck, who was a very small boy at the time of the
   events, who continues the tale.

   Thomas Sprague's funeral was held on Thursday, June 17th, only two days
   after his death. Such haste was thought almost indecent in remote and
   inaccessibly Stillwater, where long distances had to be covered by
   those who came, but Thorndike had insisted that the peculiar condition
   of the deceased demanded it. The undertaker had seemed rather nervous
   since preparing the body, and could be seen frequently feeling his
   pulse. Old Dr. Pratt thought he must be worrying about the accidental
   dose of embalming-fluid. Naturally, the story of the "laying out" had
   spread, so that a double zest animated the mourners who assembled to
   glut their curiosity and morbid interest.

   Thorndike, though he was obviously upset, seemed intent on doing his
   professional duty in magnificent style. Sophie and others who saw the
   body were most startled by its utter lifelikeness, and the mortuary
   virtuoso made doubly sure of his job by repeating certain injections at
   stated intervals. He almost wrung a sort of reluctant admiration from
   the townsfolk and visitors, though he tended to spoil that impression
   by his boastful and tasteless talk. Whenever he administered to his
   silent charge he would repeat that eternal rambling about the good luck
   of having a first-class undertaker. What--he would say as if directly
   addressing the body--if Tom had had one of those careless fellows who
   bury their subjects alive? The way he harped on the horrors of
   premature burial was truly barbarous and sickening.

   Services were held in the stuffy best room--opened for the first time
   since Mrs. Sprague died. The tuneless little parlour organ groaned
   disconsolately, and the coffin, supported on trestles near the hall
   door, was covered with sickly-smelling flowers. It was obvious that a
   record-breaking crowd was assembling from far and near, and Sophie
   endeavoured to look properly grief-stricken for their benefit. At
   unguarded moments she seemed both puzzled and uneasy, dividing her
   scrutiny between the feverish-looking undertaker and the life-like body
   of her brother. A slow disgust at Thorndike seemed to be brewing within
   her, and neighbours whispered freely that she would soon send him about
   his business now that Tom was out of the way--that is, if she could,
   for such a slick customer was sometimes hard to deal with. But with her
   money and remaining looks she might be able to get another fellow, and
   he'd probably take care of Henry well enough.

   As the organ wheezed into Beautiful Isle of Somewhere the Methodist
   church choir added their lugubrious voices to the gruesome cacophony,
   and everyone looked piously at Deacon Leavitt--everyone, that is,
   except crazy Johnny Dow, who kept his eyes glued to the still form
   beneath the class of the coffin. He was muttering softly to himself.

   Stephen Barbour--from the next farm--was the only one who noticed
   Johnny. He shivered as he saw that the idiot was talking directly to
   the corpse, and even making foolish signs with his fingers as if to
   taunt the sleeper beneath the plate glass. Tom, he reflected, had
   kicked poor Johnny around on more than one occasion, though probably
   not without provocation. Something about this whole event was getting
   on Stephen's nerves. There was a suppressed tension and brooding
   abnormality in the air for which he could not account. Johnny ought not
   to have been allowed in the house--and it was curious what an effort
   Thorndike seemed to be making not to look at the body. Every now and
   then the undertaker would feel his pulse with an odd air.

   The Reverend Silas Atwood droned on in a plaintive monotone about the
   deceased--about the striking of Death's sword in the midst of this
   little family, breaking the earthly tie between this loving brother and
   sister. Several of the neighbours looked furtively at one another from
   beneath lowered eyelids, while Sophie actually began to sob nervously.
   Thorndike moved to her side and tried to reassure her, but she seemed
   to shrink curiously away from him. His motions were distinctly uneasy,
   and he seemed to feel acutely the abnormal tension permeating the air.
   Finally, conscious of his duty as master of ceremonies, he stepped
   forward and announced in a sepulchral voice that the body might be
   viewed for the last time.

   Slowly the friends and neighbours filed past the bier, from which
   Thorndike roughly dragged crazy Johnny away. Tom seemed to be resting
   peacefully. That devil had been handsome in his day. A few genuine
   sobs--and many feigned ones--were heard, though most of the crowd were
   content to stare curiously and whisper afterward. Steve Barbour
   lingered long and attentively over the still face, and moved away
   shaking his head. His wife, Emily, following after him, whispered that
   Henry Thorndike had better not boast so much about his work, for Tom's
   eyes had come open. They had been shut when the services began, for she
   had been up and looked. But they certainly looked natural--not the way
   one would expect after two days.

   When Fred Peck gets this far he usually pauses as if he did not like to
   continue. The listener, too, tends to feel that something unpleasant is
   ahead. But Peck reassures his audience with the statement that what
   happened isn't as bad as folks like to hint. Even Steve never put into
   words what he may have thought, and crazy Johnny, of course, can't be
   counted at all.

   It was Luella Morse--the nervous old maid who sang in the choir--who
   seems to have touched things off. She was filing past the coffin like
   the rest, but stopped to peer a little closer than anyone else except
   the Barbours had peered. And then, without warning, she gave a shrill
   scream and fell in a dead faint.

   Naturally, the room was at once a chaos of confusion. Old Dr. Pratt
   elbowed his way to Luella and called for some water to throw in her
   face, and others surged up to look at her and the coffin. Johnny Dow
   began chanting to himself, "He knows, he knows, he kin hear all we're
   a-sayin' and see all we're a-doin', and they'll bury him that way"--but
   no one stopped to decipher his mumbling except Steve Barbour.

   In a very few moments Luella began to come out of her faint, and could
   not tell exactly what had startled her. All she could whisper was, "The
   way he looked--the way he looked." But to other eyes the body seemed
   exactly the same. It was a gruesome sight, though, with those open eyes
   and that high colouring.

   And then the bewildered crowed noticed something which put both Luella
   and the body out of their minds for a moment. It was Thorndike--on whom
   the sudden excitement and jostling crowd seemed to be having a
   curiously bad effect. He had evidently been knocked down in the general
   bustle, and was on the floor trying to drag himself to a sitting
   posture. The expression on his face was terrifying in the extreme, and
   his eyes were beginning to take on a glazed, fishy expression. He could
   scarcely speak aloud, but the husky rattle of his throat held an
   ineffable desperation which was obvious to all.

   "Get me home, quick, and let me be. That fluid I got in my arm by
   mistake...heart action...the damned excitement...too
   much...wait...wait...don't think I'm dead if I seem to...only the
   fluid--just get me home and wait...I'll come to later, don't know how
   long...all the time I'll be conscious and know what's going on...don't
   be deceived..."

   As his words trailed off into nothingness old Dr. Pratt reached him and
   felt his pulse--watching a long time and finally shaking his head. "No
   use doing anything--he's gone. Heart no good--and that fluid he got in
   his arm must have been bad stuff. I don't know what it is."

   A kind of numbness seemed to fall on all the company. New death in the
   chamber of death! Only Steve Barbour thought to bring up Thorndike's
   last choking words. Was he surely dead, when he himself had said he
   might falsely seem so? Wouldn't it be better to wait a while and see
   what would happen? And for that matter, what harm would it do if Doc
   Pratt were to give Tom Sprague another looking over before burial?

   Crazy Johnny was moaning, and had flung himself on Thorndike's body
   like a faithful dog. "Don't ye bury him, don't ye bury him! He ain't
   dead no more nor Lige Hopkins's dog nor Deacon Leavitt's calf was when
   he shot 'em full. He's got some stuff he puts into ye to make ye seem
   like dead when ye ain't! Ye seem like dead but ye know everything
   what's a-goin' on, and the next day ye come to as good as ever. Don't
   ye bury him--he'll come to under the earth an' he can't scratch up!
   He's a good man, an' not like Tom Sprague. Hope to Gawd Tom scratches
   an' chokes for hours an' hours..."

   But no one save Barbour was paying any attention to poor Johnny.
   Indeed, what Steve himself had said had evidently fallen on deaf ears.
   Uncertainly was everywhere. Old Doc Pratt was applying final tests and
   mumbling about death certificate blanks, and unctuous Elder Atwood was
   suggesting that something be done about a double interment. With
   Thorndike dead there was no undertaker this side of Rutland, and it
   would mean a terrible expense if one were to be brought from there, and
   if Thorndike were not embalmed in this hot June weather--well, one
   couldn't tell. And there were no relatives or friends to be critical
   unless Sophie chose to be--but Sophie was on the other side of the
   room, staring silently, fixedly, and almost morbidly into her brother's
   coffin.

   Deacon Leavitt tried to restore a semblance of decorum, and had poor
   Thorndike carried across the hall to the sitting-room, meanwhile
   sending Zenas Wells and Walter Perkins over to the undertaker's house
   for a coffin of the right size. The key was in Henry's trousers pocket.
   Johnny continued to whine and paw at the body, and Elder Atwood busied
   himself with inquiring about Thorndike's denomination--for Henry had
   not attended local services. When it was decided that his folks in
   Rutland--all dead now--had been Baptists, the Reverend Silas decided
   that Deacon Leavitt had better offer the brief prayer.

   It was a gala day for the funeral-fanciers of Stillwater and vicinity.
   Even Luella had recovered enough to stay. Gossip, murmured and
   whispered, buzzed busily while a few composing touches were given to
   Thorndike's cooling, stiffening form. Johnny had been cuffed out of the
   house, as most agreed he should have been in the first place, but his
   distant howls were now and then wafted gruesomely in.

   When the body was encoffined and laid out beside that of Thomas
   Sprague, the silent, almost frightening-looking Sophie gazed intently
   as it as she had gazed at her brother's. She had not uttered a word for
   a dangerously long time, and the mixed expression on her face was past
   all describing or interpreting. As the others withdrew to leave her
   alone with the dead she managed to find a sort of mechanical speech,
   but no one could make out the words, and she seemed to be talking first
   to one body and then the other.

   And now, with what would seem to an outside the acme of gruesome
   unconscious comedy, the whole funeral mummery of the afternoon was
   listlessly repeated. Again the organ wheezed, again the choir screeched
   and scraped, again a droning incantation arose, and again the morbidly
   curious spectators filed past a macabre object--this time a dual array
   of mortuary repose. Some of the more sensitive people shivered at the
   whole proceeding, and again Stephen Barbour felt an underlying note of
   eldritch horror and daemoniac abnormality. God, how life-like both of
   those corpses were...and how in earnest poor Thorndike had been about
   not wanting to be judged dead...and how he hated Tom Sprague...but what
   could one do in the face of common sense--a dead man was a dead man,
   and there was old Doc Pratt with his years of experience...if nobody
   else bothered, why should one bother oneself?...Whatever Tom had got he
   had probably deserved...and if Henry had done anything to him, the
   score was even now...well, Sophie was free at last...

   As the peering procession moved at last toward the hall and the outer
   door, Sophie was alone with the dead once more. Elder Atwood was out in
   the road talking to the hearse-driver from Lee's livery stable, and
   Deacon Leavitt was arranging for a double quota of pall-bearers.
   Luckily the hearse would hold two coffins. No hurry--Ed Plummer and
   Ethan Stone were going ahead with shovels to dig the second grave.
   There would be three livery hacks and any number of private rigs in the
   cavalcade--no use trying to keep the crowd away from the graves.

   Then came that frantic scream from the parlour where Sophie and the
   bodies were. Its suddenness almost paralysed the crowd and brought back
   the same sensation which had surged up when Luella had screamed and
   fainted. Steve Barbour and Deacon Leavitt started to go in, but before
   they could enter the house Sophie was bursting forth, sobbing and
   gasping about "That face at the window!...that face at the window!..."

   At the same time a wild-eyed figure rounded the corner of the house,
   removing all mystery from Sophie's dramatic cry. It was, very
   obviously, the face's owner--poor crazy Johnny, who began to leap up
   and down, pointing at Sophie and shrieking, "She knows! She knows! I
   seen it in her face when she looked at 'em and talked to 'em! She
   knows, and she's a-lettin' 'em go down in the earth to scratch and claw
   for air...But they'll talk to her so's she kin hear 'em...they'll talk
   to her, an' appear to her...and some day they'll come back an' git
   her!"

   Zenas Wells dragged the shrieking half-wit to a woodshed behind the
   house and bolted him in as best he could. His screams and poundings
   could be heard at a distance, but nobody paid him any further
   attention. The procession was made up, and with Sophie in the first
   hack it slowly covered the short distance past the village to the Swamp
   Hollow burying-ground.

   Elder Atwood made appropriate remarks as Thomas Sprague was laid to
   rest, and by the time he was through, Ed and Ethan had finished
   Thorndike's grave on the other side of the cemetery--to which the crowd
   was presently shifted. Deacon Leavitt then spoke ornamentally, and the
   lowering process was repeated. People had begun to drift off in knots,
   and the clatter of receding buggies and carryalls was quite universal,
   when the shovels began to fly again. As the earth thudded down on the
   coffin-lids, Thorndike's first, Steve Barbour noticed the queer
   expressions flitting over Sophie Sprague's face. He couldn't keep track
   of them all, but behind the rest there seemed to lurk a sort of wry,
   perverse, half-suppressed look of vague triumph. He shook his head.

   Zenas had run ahead and let crazy Johnny out of the woodshed before
   Sophie got home, and the poor fellow at once made frantically for the
   graveyard. He arrived before the shovelmen were through, and while many
   of the curious mourners were still lingering about. What he shouted
   into Tom Sprague's partly filled grave, and how he clawed at the loose
   earth of Thorndike's freshly finished mound across the cemetery,
   surviving spectators still shudder to recall. Jotham Blake, the
   constable, had to take him back to the town farm by force, and his
   screams waked dreadful echoes.

   This is where Fred Peck usually leaves off the story. What more, he
   asks, is there to tell? It was a gloomy tragedy, and one can scarcely
   wonder that Sophie grew queer after that. That is all one hears if the
   hour is so late that old Calvin Wheeler has tottered home, but when he
   is still around he breaks in again with that damnably suggestive and
   insidious whisper. Sometimes those who hear him dread to pass either
   the shuttered house or the graveyard afterward, especially after dark.

   "Heh, heh...Fred was only a little shaver then, and don't remember no
   more than half of what was goin' on! You want to know why Sophie keeps
   her house shuttered, and why crazy Johnny still keeps a-talkin' to the
   dead and a-shoutin' at Sophie's windows? Well, sir, I don't know's I
   know all there is to know, but I hear what I hear."

   Here the old man ejects his cud of tobacco and leans forward to
   buttonhole the listener.

   "It was that same night, mind ye--toward mornin', and just eight hours
   after them burials--when we heard the first scream from Sophie's house.
   Woke us all up--Steve and Emily Barbour and me and Matildy goes over
   hot-footin', all in night gear, and finds Sophie all dressed and dead
   fainted on the settin'-room floor. Lucky she hadn't locked the door.
   When we got her to she was shakin' like a leaf, and wouldn't let on by
   so much as a word what was ailin' her. Matildy and Emily done what they
   could to quiet her down, but Steve whispered things to me as didn't
   make me none too easy. Come about an hour when we allowed we'd be goin'
   home soon, that Sophie she begun to tip her head on one side like she
   was a-listenin' to somethin'. Then on a sudden she screamed again, and
   keeled over in another faint.

   "Well, sir, I'm tellin' what I'm tellin', and won't do no guessin' like
   Steve Barbour would a done if he dared. He always was the greatest hand
   for hintin' things...died ten years ago of pneumony.

   ...

   "What we heard so faint-like was just poor crazy Johnny, of course.
   'Taint more than a mile to the buryin'-ground, and he must a got out of
   the window where they'd locked him up at the town farm--even if
   Constable Blake says he didn't get out that night. From that day to
   this he hangs around them graves a-talkin' to the both of them--cussin'
   and kickin' at Tom's mound, and puttin' posies and things on Henry's.
   And when he ain't a-doin' that he's hangin' around Sophie's shuttered
   windows howlin' about what's a-comin' soon to git her.

   "She wouldn't never go near the buryin'-ground, and now she won't come
   out of the house at all nor see nobody. Got to sayin' there was a curse
   on Stillwater--and I'm dinged if she ain't half right, the way things
   is a-goin' to pieces these days. There certainly was somethin' queer
   about Sophie right along. Once when Sally Hopkins was a'callin' on
   her--in '97 or '98, I think it was--there was an awful rattlin' at her
   winders--and Johnny was safe locked up at the time--at least, so
   Constable Dodge swore up and down. But I ain't takin' no stock in their
   stories about noises every seventeenth of June, or about faint shinin'
   figures a-tryin' Sophie's door and winders every black mornin' about
   two o'clock.

   "You see, it was about two o'clock in the mornin' that Sophie heard the
   sounds and keeled over twice that first night after the buryin'. Steve
   and me, and Matildy and Emily, heard the second lot, faint as it was,
   just like I told you. And I'm a-tellin' you again as how it must a been
   crazy Johnny over to the buryin'-ground, let Jotham Blake claim what he
   will. There ain't no tellin' the sound of a man's voice so far off, and
   with our heads full of nonsense it ain't no wonder we thought there was
   two voices--and voices that hadn't ought to be speakin' at all.

   "Steve, he claimed to have heard more than I did. I verily believe he
   took some stock in ghosts. Matildy and Emily was so scared they didn't
   remember what they heard. And curious enough, nobody else in town--if
   anybody was awake at the ungodly hour--never said nothin' about hearin'
   no sounds at all.

   "Whatever it was, was so faint it might have been the wind if there
   hadn't been words. I made out a few, but don't want to say as I'd back
   up all Steve claimed to have caught...

   "'She-devil'...'all the time'...'Henry'...and 'alive' was plain...and
   so was 'you know'...'said you'd stand by'...'get rid of him' and 'bury
   me'...in a kind of changed voice...Then there was that awful 'comin'
   again some day'--in a death-like squawk...but you can't tell me Johnny
   couldn't have made those sounds.

   ...

   "Hey, you! What's takin' you off in such a hurry? Mebbe there's more I
   could tell you if I had a mind..."

1[edit]

   IT WAS languid curiosity which first brought Stephen Jones to Rogers'
   Museum. Someone had told him about the queer underground place in
   Southwark Street across the river, where waxen things so much more
   horrible than the worst effigies at Madame Tussaud's were shown, and he
   had strolled in one April day to see how disappointing he would find
   it. Oddly, he was not disappointed. There was something different and
   distinctive here, after all. Of course, the usual gory commonplaces
   were present--Landru, Doctor Crippen, Madame Demers, Rizzio, Lady Jane
   Grey, endless maimed victims of war and revolution, and monsters like
   Gilles de Rais and Marquis de Sade--but there were other things which
   had made him breathe faster and stay till the ringing of the closing
   bell. The man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary
   mountebank. There was imagination--even a kind of diseased genius--in
   some of this stuff.

   Later he had learned about George Rogers. The man had been on the
   Tussaud staff, but some trouble had developed which led to his
   discharge. There were aspersions on his sanity and tales of his crazy
   forms of secret worship--though latterly his success with his own
   basement museum had dulled the edge of some criticisms while sharpening
   the insidious point of others. Teratology and the iconography of
   nightmare were his hobbies, and even he had had the prudence to screen
   off some of his worst effigies in a special alcove for adults only. It
   was this alcolve which had fascinated Jones so much. There were lumpish
   hybrid things which only fantasy could spawn, molded with devilish
   skill, and colored in a horribly life-like fashion.

   Some were the figures of well-known myth--gorgons, chimeras. dragons,
   cyclops, and all their shuddersome congeners. Others were drawn from
   darker and more furtively whispered cycles of subterranean
   legend--black, formless Tsathoggua, many-tentacled Cthulhu,
   proboscidian Chaugnar Faugn, and other rumored blasphemies from
   forbidden books like the Necronomicon, the Book of Eibon, or the
   Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt. But the worst were wholly
   original with Rogers, and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity
   had ever dared to suggest. Several were hideous parodies on forms of
   organic life we know, while others seemed to be taken from feverish
   dreams of other planets and galaxies. The wilder painted of Clark
   Ashton Smith might suggest a few--but nothing could suggest the effect
   of poignant, loathsome terror created by their great size and
   fiendishly cunning workmanship, and by the diabolically clever lighting
   conditions under which they were exhibited.

   Stephen Jones, as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art, had
   sought out Rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the
   vaulted museum chamber--an evil-looking crypt lighted dimly by dusty
   windows set slit-like and horizontal in the brick wall on a level with
   the ancient cobblestones of a hidden courtyard. It was here that the
   images were repaired--here, too, where some of them had been made.
   Waxen arms, legs, heads and torsos lay in grotesque array on various
   benches, while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs, ravenous-looking
   teeth, and glassy, staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered.
   Costumes of all sorts hung from hooks, and in one alcove were great
   piles of flesh-colored wax-cakes and shelves filled with paint-cans and
   brushes of every description. In the center of the room was a large
   melting-furnace used to prepare the wax for molding, its fire-box
   topped by a huge iron container on hinges, with a spout which permitted
   the pouring of melted wax with the merest touch of a finger.

   Other things in the dismal crypt were less describable--isolated parts
   of problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of
   delirium. At one end was a door of heavy plank, fastened by an
   unusually large padlock and with a very peculiar symbol painted over
   it. Jone, who had once had access to the dreaded Necronomicon, shivered
   involuntarily as he recognized that symbol. This showman, he reflected,
   must indeed be a person of disconcertingly wide scholarship in dark and
   dubious fields.

   Nor did the conversation of Rogers disappoint him. The man was tall,
   lean, and rather unkempt, with large black eyes which gazed
   combustively from a pallid and usually stubble-covered face. He did not
   resent Jones' intrusion, but seemed to welcome the chance of
   unburdening himself to an interested person. His voice was of singular
   depth and resonance, and harbored a sort of repressed intensity
   bordering on the feverish. Jones did not wonder that many had thought
   him mad.

   With every successive call--and such calls became a habit as the weeks
   went by--Jones had found Rogers more communicative and confidential.
   From the first there had been hints of strange faiths and practices on
   the showman's part, and later on those hints expanded into
   tales--despite a few odd corroborative photographs--whose extravagence
   was almost comic. It was some time in June, on a night when Jones had
   brought a bottle of good whisky and plied his host somewhat freely,
   that the really demented talk first appeared. Before that there had
   been wild enough stories--accounts of mysterious trips to Tibet, the
   African interior, the Arabian desert, the Amazon valley, Alaska, and
   certain little-known islands of the South Pacific, plus claims of
   having read such monstrous and half-fabulous books as the prehistoric
   Pnakotic fragments and the Dhol chants attributed to malign and
   non-human Leng--but nothing in all this had been so unmistakably insane
   as what had cropped out that June evening under the spell of the
   whisky.

   To be plain, Rogers began making vague boasts of having found certain
   things in nature that no one had found before, and of having brought
   back tangible evidences of such discoveries. According to his bibulous
   harangue, he had gone farther than anyone else in interpreting the
   obscure and primal books he studied, and had been directed by them to
   certain remote places where strange survivals are hidden--survivals of
   æons and life-cycles earlier than mankind, and in some case connected
   with other dimensions and other worlds, communication with which was
   frequent in the forgotten pre-human days. Jones marveled at the fancy
   which could conjure up such notions, and wondered just what Rogers'
   mental history had been. Had his work amidst the morbid grotesequeries
   of Madame Tussaud's been the start of his imaginative flights, or was
   the tendency innate, so that his choice of occupation was merely one of
   its manifestations? At any rate, the man's work was merely[?] very
   closely linked with his notions. Even now there was no mistaking the
   trend of his blackest hints about the nightmare monstrosities in the
   screened-off "Adults only" alcove. Heedless of ridicule, he was trying
   to imply that not all of these demoniac abnormalities were artificial.

   It was Jones' frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible
   claims which broke up the growing cordiality. Rogers, it was clear,
   took himself very seriously; for he now became morose and resentful,
   continuing to tolerate Jones only through a dogged urge to break down
   his wall of urbane and complacent incredulity. Wild tales and
   suggestions of rites and sacrifices to nameless elder gods continued,
   and now and then Rogers would lead his guest to one of the hideous
   blasphemies in the screen-off alcolve and point out features difficult
   to reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship. Jones continued
   his visits through sheer fascination, though he knew he had forfeited
   his host's regards. At times he would humor Rogers with pretended
   assent to some mad hint or assertion, but the gaunt showman was seldom
   to be deceived by such tactics.

   The tension came to a head later in September. Jones had casually
   dropped into the museum one afternoon, and was wandering through the
   dim corridors whose horror were now so familiar, when he heard a very
   peculiar sound from the general direction of Rogers' workroom. Others
   heard it too, and started nervously as the echoes reverberated through
   the great vaulted basement. The three attendants exchanged odd glances;
   and one of them, a dark, taciturn, foreign-looking fellow who always
   served Rogers as a repairer and assistant designer, smiled in a way
   which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which grated very harshly on
   some facet of Jones' sensibilities. It was the yelp or scream of a dog,
   and was such a sound as could be made only under conditions of the
   utmost fright and agony combined. Its stark, anguised frenzy was
   appalling to hear, and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held
   a double hideousness. Jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the
   museum.

   He was about to go to the door leading into the workroom, when the dark
   attendant stopped him with a word and a gesture. Mr. Rogers, the man
   said in a soft, somewhat accented voice at once apologetic and vaguely
   sardonic, was out, and there were standing orders to admit no one to
   the workroom during his absence. As for that yelp, it was undoubtedly
   something out in the courtyard behind the museum. This neighborhood was
   full of stray mongrels, and their fights were sometimes shockingly
   noisy. There were no dogs in any part of the museum. But if Mr. Jones
   wished to see Mr. Rogers he might find him just before closing-time.

   After this Jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and
   examined the squalid neighborhood curiously. The leaning, decrepit
   buildings--once dwellings but now largely shops and warehouses--were
   very ancient indeed. Some of them were of a gabled type seeming to go
   back to Tudor times, and a faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the
   whole region. Beside the dingy house whose basement held the museum was
   a low archway pierced by a dark cobbled alley, and this Jones entered
   in a vague wish to find the courtyard behind the workroom and settle
   the affair of the dog comfortably in his mind. The courtyard was dim in
   the late afternoon light, hemmed in by rear walls even uglier and more
   intangibly menacing than the crumbling facades of the evil old houses.
   Not a dog was in sight, and Jones wondered how the aftermath of such a
   frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soon.

   Despite the assistant's statement that no dog had been in the museum,
   Jones glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement
   workroom--narrow, horizontal rectangles close to the grass-grown
   pavement, with grimy panes that stared repulsively and incuriously like
   the eyes of dead fish. To their left a worn flight of stairs led to an
   opaque and heavily bolted door. Some impulse urged him to crouch low on
   the damp, broken cobblestones and peer in, on the chance that the thick
   green shades, worked by long cords that hung down to a reachable level,
   might not be drawn. The outer surfaces were thick with dirt, but as he
   rubbed them with his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring curtain
   in the way of his vision.

   So shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made
   out, but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up
   spectrally as Jones tried each of the windows in turn. It seemed
   evident at first that no one was within; yet when he peered through the
   extreme right-hand window--the one nearest the entrance alley--he saw a
   glow of light at the farther end of the apartment which made him pause
   in bewilderment. There was no reason why any light should be there. It
   was an inner side of the room, and he could not recall any gas or
   electric fixture near that point. Another look defined the glow as a
   large vertical rectangle, and a though occurred to him. It was in that
   direction that he had always noticed the heavy plank door with the
   abnormally large padlock--the door which was never opened, and above
   which was crudely smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the
   fragmentary records of forbidden elder magic. It must be open now--and
   there was a light inside. All his former speculation as to where that
   door led, and as to what lay behind it, were now renewed with trebly
   disquieting force.

   Jones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six
   o'clock, when he returned to the museum to make the call on Rogers. He
   could hardly tell why he wished so especially to see the man just then,
   but there must have been some subconscious misgivings about that
   terribly unplaceable canine scream of the afternoon, and about the glow
   of light in that disturbing and usually unopened inner doorway with the
   heavy padlock. The attendants were leaving as he arrived, and he
   thought that Orabona--the dark foreign-looking assistant--eyed him with
   something like sly, repressed amusement. He did not relish that
   look--even though he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer many
   times.

   The vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion, but he
   strode quickly through it and rapped at the door of the office and
   workroom. Response was slow in coming, though there were footsteps
   inside. Finally, in response to a second knock, the lock rattled, and
   the ancient six-panelled portal creaked reluctantly open to reveal the
   slouching, feverish-eyed form of George Rogers. From the first it was
   clear that the showman was in an unusual mood. There was a curious
   mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome, and his talk
   at once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible
   sort.

   Surviving elder gods--nameless sacrifices--the other than artificial
   nature of some of the alcove horrors--all the usual boasts, but uttered
   in a tone of peculiarly increasing confidence. Obviously, Jones
   reflected, the poor fellow's madness was gaining on him. From time to
   time Rogers would send furtive glances toward the heavy, padlocked
   inner door at the end of the room, or toward a piece of coarse burlap
   on the floor not far from it, beneath which some small object appeared
   to be lying. Jones grew more nervous as the moments passed, and began
   to feel as hesitant about mentioning the afternoon's oddities as he had
   formerly been anxious to do so.

   Rogers' sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement
   of his fevered rambling.

   "Do you remember," he shouted, "what I told you about that ruined city
   in Indo-China where the Tcho-Tchos lived? You had to admit I'd been
   there when you saw the photographs, even if you did think I made that
   oblong swimmer in darkness out of wax. If you'd seen it writhing in the
   underground pools as I did. . . .

   "Well, this is bigger still. I never told you about this, because I
   wanted to work out the later parts before making any claim. When you
   see the snapshots you'll know the geography couldn't have been faked,
   and I fancy I have another way of proving It isn't any waxed concoction
   of mine. You've never seen it, for the experiments wouldn't let me keep
   It on exhibition."

   The showman glanced queerly at the padlocked door.

   "It all comes from that long ritual in the eighth Pnakotic fragment.
   When I got it figured out I saw it could only have one meaning. There
   were things in the north before the land of Lomar--before mankind
   existed--and this was one of them. It took us all the way to Alaska,
   and up the Nootak from Fort Morton, but the thing was there as we knew
   it would be. Great cyclopean ruins, acres of them. There was less left
   than we had hoped for, but after three million years what could one
   expect? And weren't the Eskimo legends all in the right direction? We
   couldn't get one of the beggars to go with us, and had to sledge all
   the way back to Nome for Americans. Orabona was no good up in that
   climate--it made him sullen and hateful.

   "I'll tell you later how we found It. When we got the ice blasted out
   of the pylons of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it
   would be. Some carvings still there, and it was no trouble keeping the
   Yankees from following us in. Orabona shivered like a leaf--you'd never
   think it from the damned insolent way he struts around here. He knew
   enough of the Elder Lore to be properly afraid. The eternal light was
   gone, but our torches showed enough. We saw the bones of others who had
   been before us-æons ago, when the climate was warm. Some of those bones
   were of things you couldn't even imagine. At the third level down we
   found the ivory throne the fragments said so much about--and I may as
   well tell you it wasn't empty.

   "The thing on the throne didn't move--and we knew then that It needed
   the nourishment of sacrifice. But we didn't want to wake It then.
   Better to get It to London first. Orabona and I went to the surface for
   the big box, but when we had packed it we couldn't get It up the three
   flights of steps. These steps weren't made for human beings, and their
   size bothered us. Anyway, it was devilish heavy. We had to have the
   Americans down to get It out. They weren't anxious to go into the
   place, but of course the worst thing was safely inside the box. We told
   them it was a batch of ivory carving--archeological stuff; and after
   seeing the carved throne they probably believed us. It's a wonder they
   didn't suspect hidden treasure and demand a share. They must have told
   queer tales around Nome later on; though I doubt if they ever went back
   to those ruins, even for the ivory throne."

   Rogers paused, felt around in his desk, and produced an envelope of
   good-sized photographic prints. Extracting one and laying it face down
   before him, he handed the rest to Jones. The set was certainly an odd
   one: ice-clad hills, dog sledges, men in furs, and vast tumbled ruins
   against a background of snow--ruins whose bizarre outlines and enormous
   stone blocks could hardly be accounted for. One flashlight view showed
   an incredible interior chamber with wild carvings and a curious throne
   whose proportions could not have been designed for a human occupant.
   The carvings of the gigantic masonry--high walls and peculiar vaulting
   overhead--were mainly symbolic, and involved both wholly unknown
   designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited in obscene legends. Over
   the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on the
   workroom wall above the padlocked plank door. Jones darted a nervous
   glance at the closed portal. Assuredly, Rogers had been to strange
   places and had seen strange things. Yet this mad interior picture might
   easily be a fraud--taken from a very clever stage setting. One must not
   be too credulous. But Rogers was continuing:

   "Well, we shipped the box from Nome and got to London without any
   trouble. That was the first time we'd ever brought back anything that
   had a chance of coming alive. I didn't put It on display, because there
   were more important things to do for It. It needed the nourishment of
   sacrifice, for It was a god. Of course I couldn't get It the sort of
   sacrifices which It used to have in Its day, for such things don't
   exist now. But there were other things which might do. The blood is the
   life, you know. Even the lemures and elementals that are older than the
   earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the
   right conditions."

   The expression on the narrator's face was growing very alarming and
   repulsive, so that Jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair. Rogers
   seemed to notice his guest's nervousness, and continued with a
   distinctly evil smile.

   "It was last year that I got It, and ever since then I've been trying
   rites and sacrifices. Orabona hasn't been much help, for he was always
   against the idea of waking It. He hates It--probably because he's
   afraid of what It will come to mean. He carries a pistol all the time
   to protect himself--fool, as if there were human protection against It!
   If I ever see him draw that pistol, I'll strangle him. He wanted me to
   kill It and make an effigy of It. But I've stuck by my plans, and I'm
   coming out on top in spite of all the cowards like Orabona and damned
   sniggering skeptics like you, Jones! I've chanted the rites and made
   certain sacrifices, and last week the transition came. The sacrifice
   was--received and enjoyed!"

   Rogers actually licked his lips, while Jones held himsef uneasily
   rigid. The showman paused and rose, crossing the room to the piece of
   burlap at which he had glanced so often. Bending down, he took hold of
   one corner as he spoke again.

   "You've laughed enough at my work--now it's time for you to get some
   facts. Orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this
   afternoon. Do you know what that meant?"

   Jones started. For all his curiosity he would have been glad to get out
   without further light on the point which had so puzzled him. But Rogers
   was inexorable, and began to lift the square of burlap. Beneath it lay
   a crushed, almost shapeless mass which Jones was slow to classify. Was
   it a once-living thing which some agency had flattened, sucked dry of
   blood, punctured in a thousand places, and wrung into a limp,
   broken-boned heap of grotesqueness? After a moment Jones realized what
   it must be. It was what was left of a dog--a dog, perhaps of
   considerable size and whitish color. Its breed was past recognition,
   for distortion had come in nameless and hideous ways. Most of the hair
   was burned off as by some pungent acid, and the exposed, bloodless skin
   was riddled by innumerable circular wounds or incisions. The form of
   torture necessary to cause such results was past imagining.

   Electrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust,
   Jones sprang with a cry.

   "You damned sadist--you madman--you do a thing like this and dare to
   speak to a decent man!"

   Rogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming
   guest. His words held an unnatural calm.

   "Why, you fool, do you think I did this? What of it? It is not human
   and does not pretend to be. To sacrifice is merely to offer. I gave the
   dog to It. What happened is It's work, not mine. It needed the
   nourishment of the offering, and took it in Its own way. But let me
   show you what It looks like."

   As Jones stood hesitating, the speaker had returned to his desk and
   took up the photograph he had laid face down without showing. Now he
   extended it with a curious look. Jones took it and glanced at in in an
   almost mechanical way. After a moment the visitor's glance became
   sharper and more absorbed, for the utterly satanic force of the object
   depicted had an almost hypnotic effect. Certainly, Rogers had outdone
   himself in modeling the eldritch nightmare which the camera had caught.
   The thing was a work of sheer, infernal genius, and Jones wondered how
   the public would react when it was placed on exhibition. So hideous a
   thing had no right to exist--probably the mere contemplation of it,
   after it was done, had completed the unhinging of its maker's mind and
   led him to worship it with brutal sacrifices. Only a stout sanity could
   resist the insidious suggestion that the blasphemy was--or had once
   been--some morbid and exotic form of actual life.

   The thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to
   be a clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other
   curious photograph. To describe it with any ordinary vocabulary would
   be impossible, for nothing even roughly corresponding to it has ever
   come within the imagination of sane mankind. It represented something
   meant perhaps to be roughly connected with the vertebrates of this
   planet--though one could not be too sure of that. Its bulk was
   cyclopean, for even squatted it towered to almost twice the height of
   Orabona, who was shown beside it. Looking sharply, one might trace its
   approximations toward the bodily features of the higher vertebrates.

   There was an almost globular torso, with six long, sinuous limbs
   terminating in crab-like claws. From the upper end a subsidiary globe
   bulged forth bubble-like; its triangle of three staring, fishy eyes,
   its foot-long and evidently flexible proboscis, and a distended lateral
   system analogous to gills, suggesting that it was a head. Most of the
   body was covered with what at first appeared to be fur, but which on
   closer examination proved to be a dense growth of dark, slender
   tentacles or sucking filaments, each tipped with a mouth suggesting the
   head of an asp. On the head and below the proboscis the tentacles
   tended to be longer and thicker, marked with spiral stripes--suggesting
   the traditional serpent-locks of Medusa. To suggest that such a thing
   could have an expression seems paradoxical; yet Jones felt that that
   triangle of bulging fish eyes and that obliquely poised proboscis all
   bespoke a blend of hate, greed and sheer cruelty incomprehensible to
   mankind because it was mixed with other emotions not of the world or
   this solar system. Into this bestial abnormality, he reflected, Rogers
   must have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny
   sculptural genius. The thing was incredible--and yet the photograph
   proved that it existed.

   Rogers interrupted his reveries.

   "Well--what do you think of It? Now do you wonder what crushed the dog
   and sucked it dry with a million mouths? It needed nourishment--and It
   will need more. It is a god, and I am the first priest of Its
   latter-day hierarchy. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand
   Young!"

   Jones lowered the photograph in disgust and pity.

   "See here, Rogers, this won't do. There are limits, you know. It's a
   great piece of work, and all that, but it isn't good for you. Better
   not see it any more--let Orabona break it up, and try to forget about
   it. And let me tear this beastly picture up, too."

   With a snarl, Rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the
   desk.

   "Idiot--you--and you still think It's a fraud! You still think I made
   It, and you still think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax! Why,
   damn you, you're going to know. Not just now, for It is resting after
   the sacrifice--but later. Oh, yes--you will not doubt the power of It
   then."

   As Rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door Jones retrieved his
   hat and stick from a near-by bench.

   "Very well, Rogers, let it be later. I must be going now, but I'll call
   round tomorrow afternoon. Think my advice over and see if it doesn't
   sound sensible. Ask Orabona what he thinks, too."

   Rogers bared his teeth in wild-beast fashion.

   "Must be going now, eh? Afraid, after all! Afraid, for all your bold
   talk! You say the effigies are only wax, and yet you run away when I
   begin to prove that they aren't. You're like the fellows who take my
   standing bet that they daren't spend the night in the museum--they come
   boldly enough, but after an hour they shriek and hammer to get out!
   Want me to ask Orabona, eh? You two--always against me! You want to
   break down the coming earthly reign of It!"

   Jones preserved his calm.

   "No, Rogers--there's nobody against you. And I'm not afraid of your
   figures, either, much as I admire your skill. But we're both a bit
   nervous tonight, and I fancy some rest will do us good."

   Again Rogers checked his guest's departure.

   "Not afraid, eh?--then why are you so anxious to go? Look here--do you
   or don't you dare to stay alone here in the dark? What's your hurry if
   you don't believe in It?"

   Some new idea seemed to have struck Rogers, and Jones eyed him closely.

   "Why, I've no special hurry--but what would be gained by my staying
   here alone? What would it prove? My only objection is that it isn't
   very comfortable for sleeping. What good would it do either of us?"

   This time it was Jones who was struck with an idea. He continued in a
   tone of conciliation.

   "See here, Rogers--I've just asked you what it would prove if I stayed,
   when we both knew. It would prove that your effigies are just effigies,
   and that you oughtn't to let your imagination go the way it's been
   going lately. Suppose I do stay. If I stick it out till morning, will
   you agree to take a new view of things--go on a vacation for three
   months or so and let Orabona destroy that new thing of yours? Come,
   now--isn't that fair?"

   The expression on the showman's face was hard to read. It was obvious
   that he was thinking quickly, and that of sundry conflicting emotions,
   malign triumph was getting the upper hand. His voice held a choking
   quality as he replied.

   "Fair enough! If you do stick it out, I'll take your advice. We'll go
   out for dinner and come back. I'll lock you in the display room and go
   home. In the morning I'll come down ahead of Orabona--he comes half an
   hour before the rest--and see how you are. But don't try it unless you
   are very sure of your skepticism. Others have backed out--you have that
   chance. And I suppose a pounding on the outer door would always bring a
   constable. You may not like it so well after a while--you'll be in the
   same building, though not in the same room with It."

   As they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard, Rogers took with
   him the piece of burlap--weighted with a gruesome burden. Near the
   center of the court was a manhole, whose cover the showman lifted
   quietly, and with a shuddersome suggestion of familiarity. Burlap and
   all, the burden went down to the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth. Jones
   shuddered, and almost shrank from the gaunt figure at his side as they
   emerged into the street.

   By unspoken mutual consent, they did not dine together, but agreed to
   meet in front of the museum at eleven.

   Jones hailed a cab, and breathed more freely when he had crossed
   Waterloo Bridge and was approaching the brilliantly lighted Strand. He
   dined at a quite café, and subsequently went to his home in Portland
   Place to bathe and get a few things. Idly he wondered what Rogers was
   doing. He had heard that the man had a vast, dismal house in the
   Walworth Road, full of obscure and forbidden books, occult
   paraphernalia, and wax images which he did not choose to place on
   exhibition. Orabona, he understood, lived in separate quarters in the
   same house.

   At eleven Jones found Rogers waiting by the basement door in Southwark
   Street. Their words were few, but each seemed taut with a menacing
   tension. They agreed that the vaulted exhibition room alone should form
   the scene of the vigil, and Rogers did not insist that the watcher sit
   in the special adult alcove of supreme horrors. The showman, having
   extinguished all the lights with switches in the workroom, locked the
   door of that crypt with one of the keys on his crowded ring. Without
   shaking hands he passed out the street door, locked it after him, and
   passed up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside. As his tread receded,
   Jones realized that the long, tedious vigil had commenced.

2[edit]

   Later, in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar, Jones cursed
   the childish naïveté which had brought him there. For the first
   half-hour he had kept flashing his pocket-light at intervals, but now
   just sitting in the dark on one of the visitor's benches had become a
   more nerve-wracking thing. Every time the beam shot out it lighted up
   some morbid, grotesque object--a guillotine, a nameless hybrid monster,
   a pasty-bearded face crafty with evil, a body with red torrents
   streaming from a severed throat. Jones knew that no sinister reality
   was attached to these things, but after that first half-hour he
   preferred not to see them.

   Why he had bothered to humor that madman he could scarcely imagine. It
   would have been much simpler merely to have let him alone, or to have
   called in a mental specialist. Probably, he reflected, it was the
   fellow-feeling of one artist for another. There was so much genius in
   Rogers that he deserved every possible chance to be helped quietly out
   of his growing mania. Any man who could imagine and construct the
   incredibly life-like things that he had produced was not far from
   actual greatness. He had the fancy of a Sime or a Doré joined to the
   minute, scientific craftsmanship of a Blatschka. Indeed, he had done
   for the world of nightmare what the Blatschkas with their marvelously
   accurate plant models of finely wrought and coloured glass had done for
   the world of botany.

   At midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the
   darkness, and Jones felt cheered by the message from a still-surviving
   outside world. The vaulted museum chamber was like a tomb--ghastly in
   its utter solitude. Even a mouse would be cheering company; yet Rogers
   had once boasted that--for "certain reasons," as he said--no mice or
   even insects ever came near the place. That was very curious, yet it
   seemed to be true. The deadness and silence were virtually complete. If
   only something would make a sound! He shuffled his feet, and the echoes
   came spectrally out of the absolute stillness. He coughed, but there
   was something mocking in the staccato reverberations. He could not, he
   vowed, begin talking to himself. That meant nervous disintegration.
   Time seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting slowness. He could
   have sworn that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on
   his watch, yet here was only the stroke of midnight.

   He wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen. Something
   in the darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them, so that
   they responded to faint intimations hardly strong enough to be called
   true impressions. His ears seemed at times to catch a faint, elusive
   susurrus which could not quite be identified with the nocturnal hum of
   the squalid streets outside, and he thought of vague, irrelevant things
   like the music of the spheres and the unknown, inaccessible life of
   alien dimensions pressing on our own. Rogers often speculated about
   such things.

   The floating specks of light in his blackness-drowned eyes seemed
   inclined to take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion. He had
   often wondered about those strange rays from the unplumbed abyss which
   scintillate before us in the absence of all earthly illumination, but
   he had never known any that behaved just as these were behaving. They
   lacked the restful aimlessness of ordinary light-specks--suggesting
   some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial conception.

   Then there was that suggestion of odd stirrings. Nothing was open, yet
   in spite of the general draftlessness Jones felt that the air was not
   uniformly quiet. There were intangible variations in pressure--not
   quite decided enough to suggest the loathsome pawings of unseen
   elementals. It was abnormally chilly, too. He did not like any of this.
   The air tasted salty, as if it were mixed with the brine of dark
   subterrene waters, and there was a bare hint of some odor of ineffable
   mustiness. In the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures
   had an odor. Even now that half-received hint was not the way wax
   figures ought to smell. It was more like the faint smell of specimens
   in a natural-history museum. Curious, in view of Rogers' claims that
   his figures were not all artificial--indeed, it was probably that claim
   which made one's imagination conjure up the olfactory suspicion. One
   must guard against excesses of imagination--had not such things driven
   poor Rogers mad?

   But the utter loneliness of this place was frightful. Even the distant
   chimes seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs. It made Jones think of
   that insane picture which Rogers had showed him-the wildly carved
   chamber with the cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed was part
   of a three-million-year-old ruin in the shunned and inaccessible
   solitudes of the Arctic. Perhaps Rogers had been to Alaska, but that
   picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery. It couldn't normally
   be otherwise, with all that carving and those terrible symbols. And
   that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that throne--what a
   flight of diseased fancy! Jones wondered just how far he actually was
   from the insane masterpiece in wax--probably it was kept behind that
   heavy, padlocked plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom. But
   it would never do to brood about a waxen image. Was not the present
   room full of such things, some of them scarcely less horrible than the
   dreadful "IT"? And beyond a thin canvas screen on the left was the
   "Adults only" alcove with its nameless phantoms of delirium.

   The proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on Jones'
   nerves more and more as the quarter-hours wore on. He knew the museum
   so well that he could not get rid of their usual images even in the
   total darkness. Indeed, the darkness had the effect of adding to the
   remembered images certain very disturbing imaginative overtones. The
   guillotine seemed to creak, and the bearded face of Landru--slayer of
   his fifty wives--twisted itself into expressions of monstrous menace.
   From the severed throat of Madame Demers a hideous bubbling sound
   seemed to emanate, while the headless, legless victim of a trunk murder
   tried to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps. Jones began
   shutting his eyes to see if that would dim the images, but found it was
   useless. Besides, when he shut his eyes the strange, purposeful
   patterns of light-specks became more disturbingly pronounced.

   Then suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had
   formerly been trying to banish. He tried to keep them because they were
   giving place to still more hideous ones. In spite of himself his memory
   began reconstructing the utterly non-human blasphemies that lurked in
   the obscurer corners, and these lumpish hybrid growths oozed and
   wriggled toward him as though huting him down in a circle. Black
   Tsathoggua molded itself from a toad-like gargoyle to a long, sinuous
   line with hundreds of rudimentary feet, and a lean, rubbery night-gaunt
   spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher. Jones braced
   himself to keep from screaming. He knew he was reverting to the
   traditional terrors of his childhood, and resolved to use his adult
   reason to keep the phantoms at bay. It helped a bit, he found, to flash
   the light again. Frightful as were the images it showed, these were not
   as bad as what his fancy called out of the utter blackness.

   But there were drawbacks. Even in the light of his torch he could not
   help suspecting a slight, furtive trembling on the part of the canvas
   partition screening off the terrible "Adults only" alcove. He knew what
   lay beyond, and shivered. Imagination called up the shocking forms of
   fabulous Yog-Sothoth--only a congeries of iridescent globes, yet
   stupendous in its malign suggestiveness. What was this accursed mass
   slowly floating toward him and bumping on the partition that stood in
   the way? A small bulge in the canvas far to the right suggested the
   sharp horn of Gnoph-keh, the hairy myth-thing of the Greenland ice,
   that walked sometimes on two legs, sometimes on four, and sometimes on
   six. To get this stuff out of his head Jones walked boldly toward the
   hellish alcove with torch burning steadily. Of course, none of his
   fears was true. Yet were not the long, facial tentalces of great
   Cthulhu actually swaying, slowly and insidiously? He knew they were
   flexible, but he had not realised that the draft caused by his advance
   was enough to set them in motion.

   Returning to his former seat outside the alcove, he shut his eyes and
   let the symmetrical light-specks do their worst. The distant clock
   boomed a single stroke. Could it be only one? He flashed the light on
   his watch and saw that it was precisely that hour. It would be hard
   indeed waiting for the morning. Rogers would be down at about eight
   o'clock, ahead of even Orabona. It would be light outside in the main
   basement long before that, but none of it could penetrate here. All the
   windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three small ones
   facing the court. A pretty bad wait, all told.

   His ears were getting most of the hallucinations now--for he could
   swear he heard stealthy, plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the
   closed and locked door. He had no business thinking of that unexhibited
   horror which Rogers called "It." The thing was a contamination-it had
   driven its maker mad, and now even its picture was calling up
   imaginative terrors. It was very obviously beyond that padlocked door
   of heavy planking. Those steps were certainly pure imagination.

   Then he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door. Flashing on
   his torch, he saw nothing but the ancient six-paneled portal in its
   proper position. Again he tried darkness and closed his eyes, but there
   followed a harrowing illusion of creaking--not the guillotine this
   time, but the slow, furtive opening of the workroom door. He would not
   scream. Once he screamed, he would be lost. There was a sort of padding
   or shuffling audible now, and it was slowly advancing toward him. He
   must retain command of himself. Had he not done so when the nameless
   brain-shaped tried to close in on him? The shuffling crept nearer, and
   his resolution failed. He did not scream but merely gulped out a
   challenge.

   "Who goes there? Who are you? What do you want?"

   There was no answer, but the shuffling kept on. Jones did not know
   which he feared most to do--turn on his flashlight or stay in the dark
   while the thing crept upon him. This thing was different, he felt
   profoundly, from the other terrors of the evening. His fingers and
   throat worked spasmodically. Silence was impossible, and the suspense
   of utter blackness was beginning to be the most intolerable of all
   conditions. Again he cried out hysterically--"Halt! Who goes
   there?"--as he switched on the revealing beam of his torch. Then,
   paralyzed by what he saw, he dropped the flashlight and screamed--not
   once but many times.

   Shuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic, blasphemous form
   of a black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect. Its hide hung
   loosely upon its frame, and its rugose, dead-eyed rudiment of a head
   swayed drunkenly from side to side. Its forepaws were extended, with
   talons spread wide, and its whole body was taut with murderous
   malignity despite its utter lack of facial expression. After the
   screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped, and in a moment had
   Jones pinned to the floor. There was no struggle for the watcher had
   fainted.

   Jones' fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment, for the
   nameless thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he
   began recovering consciousness. What started him fully awake were the
   sounds which the thing was making--or rather, the voice with which it
   was making them. That voice was human, and it was familiar. Only one
   living being could be behind the hoarse, feverish accents which were
   chanting to an unknown horror.

   "Iä! Iä!" it was howling. "I am coming, O Rhan-Tegoth, coming with the
   nourishment. You have waited long and fed ill, but now you shall have
   what was promised. That and more, for instead of Orabona it will be one
   of high degree who has doubted you. You shall crush and drain him, with
   all his doubts, and grow strong thereby. And ever after among men he
   shall be shown as a monument to your glory. Rhan-Tegoth, infinite and
   invincible, I am your slave and high-priest. You are hungry, and I
   shall provide. I read the sign and have led you forth. I shall feed you
   with blood, and you shall feed me with power. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The
   Goat with a Thousand Young!"

   In an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from Jones like a
   discarded cloak. He was again master of his mind, for he knew the very
   earthly and material peril he had to deal with. This was no monster of
   fable, but a dangerous madman. It was Rogers, dressed in some nightmare
   covering of his own insane designing, and about to make a frightful
   sacrifice to the devil-god he had fashioned out of wax. Clearly, he
   must have entered the workroom from the read courtyard, donned his
   disguise, and then advance to seize his neatly-trapped and fear-broken
   victim. His strength was prodigious, and if he was to be thwarted, one
   must act quickly. Counting on the madman's confidence in his
   unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise, while his grip
   was relatively lax. The feel of a threshold told him he was crossing
   into the pitch-black workroom.

   With the strength of mortal fear Jones made a sudden spring from the
   half-recumbent posture in which he was being dragged. For an instant he
   was free of the astonished maniac's hands, and in another instant a
   lucky lunge in the dark had put his own hands at his captor's weirdly
   concealed throat. Simultaneously Rogers gripped him again, and without
   further preliminaries the two were locked in a desperate struggle of
   life and death. Jones' athletic training, without doubt, was his sole
   salvation; for his mad assailant, freed from every inhibition of fair
   play, decency, or even self-preservation, was an engine of savage
   destruction as formidable as a wolf or panther.

   Guttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark.
   Blood spurted, clothing ripped, and Jones at last felt the actual
   throat of the maniac, shorn of its spectral mask. He spoke not a word,
   but put every ounce of energy into the defence of his life. Rogers
   kicked, gouged, butted, bit, clawed, and spat--yet found strength to
   yelp out actual sentences at times. Most of his speech was in a
   ritualistic jargon full of references to "It" or "Rhan-Tegoth," and to
   Jones' overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries echoed from an
   infinite distance of demoniac snortics and bayings. Toward the last
   they were rolling on the floor, overturning benches or striking against
   the walls and the brick foundations of the central melting-furnace. Up
   to the very end Jones could not be certain of saving himself, but
   chance finally intervened in his favor. A jab of his knee against
   Rogers' chest produced a general relaxation, and a moment later he knew
   he had won.

   Though hardly able to hold himself up, Jones rose and stumbled about
   the walls seeking the light-switch--for his flashlight was gone,
   together with most of his clothing. As he lurched along he dragged his
   limp opponent with him, fearing a sudden attack when the madman came
   to. Finding the switch-box, he fumbled till he had the right handle.
   Then, as the wildly disordered workroom burst into sudden radiance, he
   set about binding Rogers with such cords and belts as he could easily
   find. The fellow's disguise--or what was left of it--seemed to be made
   of a puzzling queer sort of leather. For some reason it made Jones'
   flesh crawl to touch it, and there seemed to be an alien, rusty odor
   about it. In the normal clothes beneath it was Rogers' key-ring, and
   this the exhausted victor seized as his final passport to freedom. The
   shades at the small, slit-like windows were all securely drawn, and he
   let them remain so.

   Washing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink, Jones donned the
   most ordinary-looking and least ill-fitting clothes he could find on
   the costume hooks. Testing the door to the courtyard, he found it
   fastened with a spring-lock which did not require a key from the
   inside. He kept the key-ring, however, to admit him on his return with
   aid--for plainly, the thing to do was to call in an alienist. There was
   no telephone in the museum, but it would not take long to find an
   all-night restaurant or chemist's shop where one could be had. He had
   almost opened the door when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the
   room told him that Rogers--whose visible injuries were confined to a
   long, deep scratch down the left cheek--had regained consciousness.

   "Fool! Spawn of Noth-Yidik and effluvium of K'thun! Son of the dogs
   that howl in the maelstrom of Azathoth! You would have been sacred and
   immortal, and now you are betraying It and Its priest! Beware--for It
   is hungry! It would have been Orabona--that damned treacherous dog
   ready to turn against me and It--but I give you the honor instead. Now
   you must both beware, for It is not gentle without Its priest.

   "Iä! Iä! Vengeance is at hand! Do you know you would have been
   immortal? Look at the furnace! There is a fire ready to light, and
   there is wax in the kettle. I would have done with you as I have done
   with other once living forms. Hei! You, who have vowed all my effigies
   are waxen, would have become a waxen effigy yourself! The furnace was
   already! When It had had its fill, and you were like that dog I showed
   you, I would have made your flattened, punctured fragments immortal!
   Wax would have done it. Haven't you said I'm a great artist? Wax in
   every pore--wax over every square inch of you--Iä! Iä! And ever after
   the world would have looked at your mangled carcass and wondered how I
   ever imagined and made such a thing! Hei! and Orabona would have come
   next, and others after him-and thus would my waxen family have grown!

   "Dog--do you still think I made all my effigies? Why not say preserved?
   You know by this time the strange places I've been to, and the strange
   things I've brought back. Coward--you could never face the dimensional
   shambler whose hide I put on to scare you--the mere sight of it alive,
   or even the full-fledged thought of it, would kill you instantly with
   fright! Iä! Iä! It waits hungry for the blood that is the life!"

   Rogers, propped against the wall, swayed to and fro in his bonds.

   "See here, Jones--if I let you go will you let me go? It must be taken
   care of by Its high priest. Orabona will be enough to keep It
   alive--and when he is finished I will make his fragments immortal in
   wax for the world to see. It could have been you, but you have rejected
   the honor. I won't bother you again. Let me go, and I will share with
   you the power that It will bring me. Iä! Iä! Great is Rhan-Tegoth! Let
   me go! Let me go! It is starving down there beyond that door, and if It
   dies the Old Ones can never come back. Hei! Hei! Let me go!"

   Jones merely shook his head, though the hideousness of the showman's
   imaginings revolted him. Rogers, now staring wildly at the padlocked
   plank door, thumped his head again and again against the brick wall and
   kicked with his tightly bound ankles. Jones was afraid he would injure
   himself, and advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary
   object. Writhing, Rogers edged away from him and set up a series of
   frenetic ululations whose utter, monstrous unhumanness was appalling,
   and whose sheer volume was almost incredible. It seemed impossible that
   any human throat could produce noises so loud and piercing, and Jones
   felt that if this continued there would be no need to telephone for
   aid. It could not be long before a constable would investigate, even
   granting that there were no listening neighbors in this deserted
   warehouse district.

   "Wza-y'ei! Wza-y'ei!" howled the madman. "Y'kaa haa ho-ii,
   Rhan-Tegoth-Cthulhu fthagn-Ei! Ei! Ei! Ei!-Rhan-Teogth. Rhan-Tegoth,
   Rhan-Tegoth!"

   The tautly trussed creature, who had started squirming his way across
   the littered floor, now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced
   knocking his head thunderously against it. Jones dreaded the task of
   binding him further, and wished he were not so exhausted from his
   previous struggle. This violent aftermath was getting hideously on his
   nerves, and he began to feel a return of the nameless qualms he had
   felt in the dark. Everything about Rogers and his museum was so
   hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life! It was
   loathsome to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which
   must at this very moment be lurking close at hand in the blackness
   beyond the heavy, padlocked door.

   At now something happened which sent an addition chill down Jones'
   spine, and caused every hair--even the tiny growth on the backs of his
   hands--to bristle with a vague fright beyond classification. Rogers had
   suddenly stopped screaming and beating his head against the stout plank
   door, and was straining up to a sitting position, head cocked on one
   side as if listening intently for something. All at once a smile of
   devilish triumph overspread his face, and he began speaking
   intelligibly again--this time in a hoarse whisper contrasting oddly
   with his former stentorian howling.

   "Listen, fool! Listen hard! It has heard me, and is coming. Can't you
   hear It splashing out of Its tank down there at the end of the runway?
   I dug it deep, because there was nothing too good for It. It is
   amphibious, you know--you saw the gills in the picture. It came to the
   earth from lead-gray Yuggoth, where the cities are under the warm deep
   sea. It can't stand up in there--too tall--has to sit down or crouch.
   Let me get my keys--we must let It out and kneel down before it. Then
   we will go out and find a dog or cat--or perhaps a drunken man--to give
   It the nourishment It needs."

   It was not what the madman said, but the way he said it, that
   disorganized Jones so badly. The utter, insane confidence and sincerity
   in that crazed whisper were damnably contagious. Imagination, such a
   stimulus, could find an active menace in the devilish wax figure that
   lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking. Eyeing the door in unholy
   fascination, Jones notices that it bore several distinct cracks, though
   no marks of violent treatment were visible on this side. He wondered
   how large a room or closet lay behind it, and how the waxen figure was
   arranged. The maniac's idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all
   his other imaginings.

   Then, in one terrible instant, Jones completely lost the power to draw
   a breath. The leather belt he had seized for Rogers' further strapping
   fell from his limp hands, and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from
   head to foot. He might have known the place would drive him mad as it
   had driven Rogers-and now he was mad. He was mad, for he now harbored
   hallucinations more weird than any which had assailed him earlier that
   night. The madman was bidding him hear the splashing of a mythical
   monster in a tank beyond the door--and now, God help him, he did hear
   it!

   Rogers saw the spasm of horror reach Jones' face and transform it to a
   staring mask of fear. He cackled.

   "At last, fool, you believe! At last you know! You hear It and It
   comes! Get me my keys, fool--we must do homage and serve It!"

   But Jones was past paying attention to any human words, mad or sane.
   Phobic paralysis held him immobile and half conscious, with wild images
   racing fantasmagorically though his helpless imagination. There was a
   splashing. There was padding or shuffling, as of great wet paws on a
   solid surface. Something was approaching. Into his nostrils, from the
   cracks in that nightmare plank door, poured a noisome animal stench
   like and yet unlike that of the mammal cages at the zoological gardens
   in Regent's Park.

   He did not known where Rogers was talking or not. Everything real had
   faded away, and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations
   so unnatural that they became almost objective and remote from him. He
   thought he heard a sniffing or snorting from the unknown gulf beyond
   the door, and when a sudden baying, trumpeting noise assailed his ears
   he could not feel sure that it came from the tightly bound maniac whose
   image swam uncertainly in his shaken vision. The photograph of that
   accursed, unseen wax thing persisted in floating through his
   consciousness. Such a thing had no right to exist. Had it not driven
   him mad?

   Even as he reflected, a fresh evidence of madness beset him. Something,
   he thought, was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door. It
   was patting and pawing and pushing at the planks. There was a thudding
   on the stout wood, which grew louder and louder. The stench was
   horrible. And now the assault on that door from the inside was a
   malign, determined pounding like the strokes of a battering-ram. There
   was an ominous cracking--a splintering--a welling fetor--a falling
   plank--a black paw ending in a crab-like claw. . . .

   "Help! Help! God help me! . . . Aaaaaaa! . . ."

   With intense effort Jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of
   his fear-paralysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight.
   What he evidently did must have paralleled curiously the wild, plunging
   flights of maddest nightmares; for he seems to have leaped across the
   disordered crypt at almost a single bound, yanked open the outside
   door, which closed and locked itself after him with a clatter, sprung
   up the worn stone steps three at a time, and raced frantically and
   aimlessly out of that dark cobblestoned court and through the squalid
   streets of Southwark.

   Here the memory ends. Jones does not know how he got home, and there is
   no evidence of his having hired a cab. Probably he raced all the way by
   blind instinct--over Waterloo Bridge, along the Strand and Charing
   Cross and up Haymarket and Regent Street to his own neighborhood. He
   still had on the queer melange of museum costumes when he grew
   conscious enough to call the doctor.

   A week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and
   walk in the open air.

   But he had not told the specialists much. Over his whole experience
   hung a pall of madness and nightmare, and he felt that silence was the
   only course. When he was up, he scanned intently all the papers which
   had accumulated since that hideous night, but found no reference to
   anything queer at the museum. How much, after all, had been reality?
   Where did reality end and morbid dream begin? Had his mind gone wholly
   to pieces in that dark exhibition chamber, and had the whole fight with
   Rogers been a fantasm of fever? It would help to put him on his feet if
   he could settle some of these maddening points. He must have seen that
   damnable photograph of the wax image called "It," for no brain but
   Rogers' could ever have conceived such a blasphemy.

   It was a fortnight before he dared to enter Southwark Street again. He
   went in the middle of the morning, when there was the greatest amount
   of sane, wholesome activity around the ancient, crumbling shops and
   warehouses. The museum's sign was still there, and as he approached he
   saw that the place was still open. The gateman nodded in pleasant
   recognition as he summoned up the courage to enter, and in the vaulted
   chamber below an attendant touched his cap cheerfully. Perhaps
   everything had been a dream. Would he dare to knock at the door of the
   workroom and look for Rogers?

   Then Orabona advanced to greet him. His dark, sleek face was a trifle
   sardonic, but Jones felt that he was not unfriendly. He spoke with a
   trace of accent.

   "Good morning, Mr. Jones. It is some time since we have seen you here.
   Did you wish Mr. Rogers? I'm sorry, but he is away. He had word of
   business in America, and had to go. Yes, it was very sudden. I am in
   charge now--here, and at the house. I try to maintain Mr. Rogers' high
   standard--till he is back."

   The foreigner smiled--perhaps from affability alone. Jones scarcely
   knew how to reply, but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the
   day after his last visit. Orabona seemed greatly amused by the
   questions, and took considerable care in framing his replies.

   "Oh, yes, Mr. Jones--the 28th of last month. I remember it for many
   reasons. In the morning--before Mr. Rogers got here, you understand--I
   found the workroom in quite a mess. There was a great deal of--cleaning
   up--to do. There had been--late work, you see. Important new specimen
   given its secondary baking process. I took complete charge when I came.

   "It was a hard specimen to prepare--but of course Mr. Rogers had taught
   me a great deal. He is, as you know, a very great artist. When he came
   he helped me complete the specimen--helped very materially, I assure
   you--but he left soon without even greeting the men. As I tell you, he
   was called away suddenly. There were important chemical reactions
   involved. They made loud noises--in fact, some teamsters in the court
   outside fancy they heard several pistol shots--very amusing idea!

   "As for the new specimen--that matter is very unfortunate. It is a
   great masterpiece--designed and made, you understand, by Mr. Rogers. He
   will see about it when he gets back."

   Again Orabona smiled.

   "The police, you know. We put it on display a week ago, and there were
   two or three faintings. One poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front
   of it. You see, it's a trifle--stronger--than the rest. Larger, for one
   thing. Of course, it was in the adult alcove. The next day a couple of
   men from Scotland Yard looked it over and said it was too morbid to be
   shown. Said we'd have to remove it. It was a tremendous shame--such a
   masterpiece of art--but I didn't feel justified in appealing to the
   courts in Mr. Rogers' absence. He would not like so much publicity with
   the police now--but when he gets back--when he gets back--."

   For some reason or other Jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and
   repulsion. But Orabona was continuing.

   "You are a connoisseur, Mr. Jones. I am sure I violate no law in
   offering you a private view. It may be--subject of course, to Mr.
   Rogers' wishes--that we shall destroy the specimen some day--but that
   would be a crime."

   Jones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee
   precipitately, but Orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an
   artist's enthusiasm. The adult alcove, crowded with nameless horrors,
   held no visitors. In the farther corner a large niche had been
   curtained off, and to this the smiling assistant advanced.

   "You must know, Mr. Jones, that the title of this specimen is 'The
   Sacrifice to Rhan-Tegoth.' "

   Jones started violently, but Orabona appeared not to notice.

   "The shapeless, colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends
   which Mr. Rogers had studied. All nonsense, of course, as you've so
   often assured Mr. Rogers. It is supposed to have come from outer space,
   and to have lived in the Arctic three million years ago. It treated its
   sacrifices rather peculiarly and horribly, as you shall see. Mr. Rogers
   had made it fiendishly life-like--even to the face of the victim."

   Now trembling violently, Jones clung to the brass railing in front of
   the curtained niche. He almost reached out to stop Orabona when he saw
   the curtain beginning to swing aside, but some conflicting impulse held
   him back. The foreigner smiled triumphantly.

   "Behold!"

   Jones reeled in spite of his grip on the railing.

   "God!--great god!"

   Fully ten feet high despite a shambling, crouching attitude expressive
   of infinite cosmic malignancy, a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was
   shown starting forward from a cyclopean ivory throne covered with
   grotesque carvings. In the central pair of its six legs it bore a
   crushed, flattened, distorted, bloodless thing, riddled with a million
   punctures, and in places seared as with some pungent acid. Only the
   mangled head of the victim, lolling upside down at one side, revealed
   that it represented something once human.

   The monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain
   hellish photograph. That damnable print had been all too faithful; yet
   it could not carry the full horror which lay in the gigantic actuality.
   The globular torso--the bubble-like suggestion of a head--the three
   fishy eyes--the foot-long proboscis--the bulging gills--the monstrous
   capillation of asp-like suckers--the six sinuous limbs with their black
   paws and crab-like claws--God! the familiarity of the black paw ending
   in a crab-like claw! . . .

   Orabona's smile was utterly damnable. Jones choked, and stared at the
   hideous exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and
   disturbed him. What half-revealed horror was holding and forcing him to
   look longer and search out details? This had driven Rogers mad . . .
   Rogers, supreme artist . . . said they weren't artificial. . . .

   Then he localized the thing that held him. It was the crushed waxen
   victim's lolling head, and something that it implied. This head was not
   entirely devoid of a face, and that face was familiar. It was like the
   mad face of poor Rogers. Jones peered closer, hardly knowing why he was
   driven to do so. Wasn't it natural for a mad egotist to mold his own
   features into his masterpiece? Was there anything more that
   subconscious vision had seized on and suppressed in sheer terror?

   The wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity.
   Those punctures--how perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds
   somehow inflicted on that poor dog! But there was something more. On
   the left cheek one could trace an irregularity which seemed outside the
   general scheme--as if the sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of
   his first modelling. The more Jones looked at it, the more mysteriously
   it horrified him--and then, suddenly, he remembered a circumstance
   which brought his horror to a head. That night of hideousness--the
   tussle--the bound madman--and the long, deep scratch down the left
   cheek of the actual living Rogers. . . .

   Jones, releasing his desperate clutch on the railing, sank in a total
   faint.

   Orabona continued to smile.

   In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and
   flapping, and a faint distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is
   not dream--it is not, I fear, even madness--for too much has already
   happened to give me these merciful doubts.

   St John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge
   that I am about to blow out my brains for fear I shall be mangled in
   the same way. Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch phantasy
   sweeps the black, shapeless Nemesis that drives me to
   self-annihilation.

   May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so
   monstrous a fate! Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world;
   where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale, St John
   and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual
   movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas
   of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were
   ours in their time, but each new mood was drained too soon, of its
   diverting novelty and appeal.

   Only the somber philosophy of the decadents could help us, and this we
   found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diablism of our
   penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills,
   till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of
   unnatural personal experiences and adventures. It was this frightful
   emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which
   even in my present fear I mention with shame and timidity--that hideous
   extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practice of grave-robbing.

   I cannot reveal the details of our shocking expedition, or catalogue
   even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we
   jointly dwelt, alone and servantless. Our museum was a blasphemous,
   unthinkable place, where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we
   had assembled an universe of terror and a secret room, far, far,
   underground; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx
   vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light, and
   hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the
   line of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black
   hangings. Through these pipes came at will the odors our moods most
   craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies; sometimes the
   narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and
   sometimes--how I shudder to recall it!--the frightful, soul-upheaving
   stenches of the uncovered-grave.

   Around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique
   mummies alternating with comely, lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and
   cured by the taxidermist's art, and with headstones snatched from the
   oldest churchyards of the world. Niches here and there contained skulls
   of all shapes, and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution.
   There one might find the rotting, bald pates of famous noblemen, and
   the flesh and radiantly golden heads of new-buried children.

   Statues and painting there were, all of fiendish subjects and some
   executed by St John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned
   human skin, held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was
   rumored Goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge. There were
   nauseous musical instruments, stringed, brass, wood-wind, on which St
   John and I sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and
   cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony
   cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of
   tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness and perversity. It is of this
   loot in particular that I must not speak. Thank God I had the courage
   to destroy it long before I thought of destroying myself!

   The predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable
   treasures were always artistically memorable events. We were no vulgar
   ghouls, but worked only under certain conditions of mood, landscape,
   environment, weather, season, and moonlight. These pastimes were to us
   the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression, and we gave their
   details a fastidious technical care. An inappropriate hour, a jarring
   lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod, would almost
   totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the
   exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth. Our quest for
   novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate--St John
   was always the leader, and he it was who led the way at last to that
   mocking, accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable
   doom.

   By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland
   churchyard? I think it was the dark rumor and legendry, the tales of
   one buried for five centuries, who had himself been a ghoul in his time
   and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre. I can recall the
   scene in these final moments--the pale autumnal moon over the graves,
   casting long horrible shadows; the grotesque trees, drooping sullenly
   to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs; the vast legions
   of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the antique
   ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the
   phosphorescent insects that danced like death-fires under the yews in a
   distant corner; the odors of mould, vegetation, and less explicable
   things that mingled feebly with the night-wind from over far swamps and
   seas; and, worst of all, the faint deep-toned baying of some gigantic
   hound which we could neither see nor definitely place. As we heard this
   suggestion of baying we shuddered, remembering the tales of the
   peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in
   this self same spot, torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some
   unspeakable beast.

   I remember how we delved in the ghoul's grave with our spades, and how
   we thrilled at the picture of ourselves, the grave, the pale watching
   moon, the horrible shadows, the grotesque trees, the titanic bats, the
   antique church, the dancing death-fires, the sickening odors, the
   gently moaning night-wind, and the strange, half-heard directionless
   baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure.

   Then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould, and beheld a
   rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long
   undisturbed ground. It was incredibly tough and thick, but so old that
   we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it held.

   Much--amazingly much--was left of the object despite the lapse of five
   hundred years. The skeleton, though crushed in places by the jaws of
   the thing that had killed it, held together with surprising firmness,
   and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long, firm teeth and
   its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our
   own. In the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design, which
   had apparently been worn around the sleeper's neck. It was the oddly
   conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound, or sphinx with a
   semi-canine face, and was exquisitely carved in antique Oriental
   fashion from a small piece of green jade. The expression of its
   features was repellent in the extreme, savoring at once of death,
   bestiality and malevolence. Around the base was an inscription in
   characters which neither St John nor I could identify; and on the
   bottom, like a maker's seal, was graven a grotesque and formidable
   skull.

   Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it;
   that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave.
   Even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it, but as
   we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar. Alien
   it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers
   know, but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden
   Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of
   the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too
   well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab
   daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure
   supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed
   at the dead.

   Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached
   and cavern-eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found
   it. As we hastened from the abhorrent spot, the stolen amulet in St
   John's pocket, we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the
   earth we had so lately rifled, as if seeking for some cursed and unholy
   nourishment. But the autumn moon shone weak and pale, and we could not
   be sure.

   So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we
   thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the
   background. But the autumn wind moaned sad and wan, and we could not be
   sure.

   Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to
   happen. We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without
   servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and
   unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock
   of the visitor.

   Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be a frequent fumbling
   in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also,
   upper as well as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body
   darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and
   another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far
   off. On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to
   ascribe the occurrences to imagination which still prolonged in our
   ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland
   churchyard. The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, and
   sometimes we burned a strangely scented candle before it. We read much
   in Alhazred's Necronomicon about its properties, and about the relation
   of ghosts' souls to the objects it symbolized; and were disturbed by
   what we read.

   Then terror came.

   On the night of September 24, 19--, I heard a knock at my chamber door.
   Fancying it St John's, I bade the knocker enter, but was answered only
   by a shrill laugh. There was no one in the corridor. When I aroused St
   John from his sleep, he professed entire ignorance of the event, and
   became as worried as I. It was the night that the faint, distant baying
   over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality.

   Four days later, whilst we were both in the hidden museum, there came a
   low, cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret
   library staircase. Our alarm was now divided, for, besides our fear of
   the unknown, we had always entertained a dread that our grisly
   collection might be discovered. Extinguishing all lights, we proceeded
   to the door and threw it suddenly open; whereupon we felt an
   unaccountable rush of air, and heard, as if receding far away, a queer
   combination of rustling, tittering, and articulate chatter. Whether we
   were mad, dreaming, or in our senses, we did not try to determine. We
   only realized, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently
   disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language.

   After that we lived in growing horror and fascination. Mostly we held
   to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural
   excitements, but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatize ourselves as
   the victims of some creeping and appalling doom. Bizarre manifestations
   were now too frequent to count. Our lonely house was seemingly alive
   with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess,
   and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the wind-swept moor,
   always louder and louder. On October 29 we found in the soft earth
   underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible
   to describe. They were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which
   haunted the old manor-house in unprecedented and increasing numbers.

   The horror reached a culmination on November 18, when St John, walking
   home after dark from the dismal railway station, was seized by some
   frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons. His screams had
   reached the house, and I had hastened to the terrible scene in time to
   hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted
   against the rising moon.

   My friend was dying when I spoke to him, and he could not answer
   coherently. All he could do was to whisper, "The amulet--that damned
   thing--"

   Then he collapsed, an inert mass of mangled flesh.

   I buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens, and
   mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life.
   And as I pronounced the last daemoniac sentence I heard afar on the
   moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound. The moon was up, but I
   dared not look at it. And when I saw on the dim-lighted moor a
   wide-nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound, I shut my eyes and
   threw myself face down upon the ground. When I arose, trembling, I know
   not how much later, I staggered into the house and made shocking
   obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade.

   Being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, I
   departed on the following day for London, taking with me the amulet
   after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection
   in the museum. But after three nights I heard the baying again, and
   before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark.
   One evening as I strolled on Victoria Embankment for some needed air, I
   saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the
   water. A wind, stronger than the night-wind, rushed by, and I knew that
   what had befallen St John must soon befall me.

   The next day I carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for
   Holland. What mercy I might gain by returning the thing to its silent,
   sleeping owner I knew not; but I felt that I must try any step
   conceivably logical. What the hound was, and why it had pursued me,
   were questions still vague; but I had first heard the baying in that
   ancient churchyard, and every subsequent event including St John's
   dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the
   amulet. Accordingly I sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when,
   at an inn in Rotterdam, I discovered that thieves had despoiled me of
   this sole means of salvation.

   The baying was loud that evening, and in the morning I read of a
   nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city. The rabble were in
   terror, for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the
   foulest previous crime of the neighborhood. In a squalid thieves' den
   an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left
   no trace, and those around had heard all night a faint, deep, insistent
   note as of a gigantic hound.

   So at last I stood again in the unwholesome churchyard where a pale
   winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to
   meet the withered, frosty grass and cracking slabs, and the ivied
   church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky, and the
   night-wind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas.
   The baying was very faint now, and it ceased altogether as I approached
   the ancient grave I had once violated, and frightened away an
   abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around
   it.

   I know not why I went thither unless to pray, or gibber out insane
   pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within; but,
   whatever my reason, I attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation
   partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself.
   Excavation was much easier than I expected, though at one point I
   encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture darted down out
   of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave-earth until I
   killed him with a blow of my spade. Finally I reached the rotting
   oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover. This is the last
   rational act I ever performed.

   For crouched within that centuried coffin, embraced by a closepacked
   nightmare retinue of huge, sinewy, sleeping bats, was the bony thing my
   friend and I had robbed; not clean and placid as we had seen it then,
   but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair, and
   leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp
   ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom.
   And when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep, sardonic bay as of
   some gigantic hound, and I saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the
   lost and fateful amulet of green jade, I merely screamed and ran away
   idiotically, my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical
   laughter.

   Madness rides the star-wind . . . claws and teeth sharpened on
   centuries of corpses . . . dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats
   from nigh-black ruins of buried temples of Belial. . . . Now, as the
   baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and
   the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web-wings circles
   closer and closer, I shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is
   my only refuge from the unnamed and unnameable.

   12051The HouseHoward Phillips Lovecraft

     'Tis a grove-circled dwelling
       Set close to a hill,
     Where the branches are telling
       Strange legends of ill;
     Over timbers so old
       That they breathe of the dead,
     Crawl the vines, green and cold,
       By strange nourishment fed;
   And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank
   slimy bed.

     In the gardens are growing
       Tall blossoms and fair,
     Each pallid bloom throwing
       Perfume on the air;
     But the afternoon sun
       with its shining red rays
     Makes the picture loom dun
       On the curious gaze,
   And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless
   days.

     The rank grasses are waving
       On terrace and lawn,
     Dim memories savouring
       Of things that have gone;
     The stones of the walks
       Are encrusted and wet,
     And a strange spirit stalks
       When the red sun has set.
   And the soul of the watcher is fill'd with faint pictures he fain would
   forget.

     It was in the hot Junetime
       I stood by that scene,
     When the gold rays of noontime
       Beat bright on the green.
     But I shiver'd with cold,
       Groping feebly for light,
     As a picture unroll'd -
       And my age-spanning sight
   Saw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the
   night.

   1364041The Last Testby H. P. Lovecraft and Adolphe de Castro1927

   I

   Few persons know the inside of the Clarendon story, or even that there
   is an inside not reached by the newspapers. It was a San Francisco
   sensation in the days before the fire, both because of the panic and
   menace that kept it company, and because of its close linkage with the
   governor of the state. Governor Dalton, it will be recalled, was
   Clarendon's best friend, and later married his sister. Neither Dalton
   nor Mrs. Dalton would ever discuss the painful affair, but somehow the
   facts have leaked out to a limited circle. But for that and for the
   years which have given a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the
   actors, one would still pause before probing into secrets so strictly
   guarded at the time.

   The appointment of Dr. Alfred Clarendon as medical director of San
   Quentin Penitentiary in 189- was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm
   throughout California. San Francisco had at last the honour of
   harbouring one of the greatest biologists and physicians of the period,
   and solid pathological leaders from all over the world might be
   expected to flock thither to study his methods, profit by his advice
   and researches, and learn how to cope with their own local problems.
   California, almost over night, would become a centre of medical
   scholarship with earthwide influence and reputation.

   Governor Dalton, anxious to spread the news in its fullest
   significance, saw to it that the press carried ample and dignified
   accounts of his new appointee. Pictures of Dr. Clarendon and his new
   home near old Goat Hill, sketches of his career and manifold honours,
   and popular accounts of his salient scientific discoveries were all
   presented in the principal California dailies, till the public soon
   felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studies of pyemia in
   India, of the pest in China, and of every sort of kindred disorder
   elsewhere would soon enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of
   revolutionary importance--a basic antitoxin combating the whole febrile
   principle at its very source, and ensuring the ultimate conquest and
   extirpation of fever in all its diverse forms.

   Back of the appointment stretched an extended and not wholly unromantic
   history of early friendship, long separation, and dramatically renewed
   acquaintance. James Dalton and the Clarendon family had been friends in
   New York ten years before--friends and more than friends, since the
   doctor's only sister, Georgina, was the sweetheart of Dalton's youth,
   while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his
   protégé in the days of school and college. The father of Alfred and
   Georgina, a Wall Street pirate of the ruthless elder breed, had known
   Dalton's father well; so well, indeed, that he had finally stripped him
   of all he possessed in a memorable afternoon's fight on the stock
   exchange. Dalton Senior, hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give
   his one adored child the benefit of his insurance, had promptly blown
   out his brains; but James had not sought to retaliate. It was, as he
   viewed it, all in the game; and he wished no harm to the father of the
   girl he meant to marry and of the budding young scientist whose admirer
   and protector he had been throughout their years of fellowship and
   study. Instead, he turned to the law, established himself in a small
   way, and in due course of time asked "Old Clarendon" for Georgina's
   hand.

   Old Clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly, vowing that no pauper
   and upstart lawyer was fit to be his son-in-law; and a scene of
   considerable violence had occurred. James, telling the wrinkled
   freebooter at last what he ought to have been told long before, had
   left the house and the city in a high temper; and was embarked within a
   month upon the California life which was to lead him to the
   governorship through many a fight with ring and politician. His
   farewells to Alfred and Georgina had been brief, and he had never known
   the aftermath of that scene in the Clarendon library. Only by a day did
   he miss the news of Old Clarendon's death from apoplexy, and by so
   missing it, changed the course of his whole career. He had not written
   Georgina in the decade that followed; knowing her loyalty to her
   father, and waiting till his own fortune and position might remove all
   obstacles to the match. Nor had he sent any word to Alfred, whose calm
   indifference in the face of affection and hero-worship had always
   savoured of conscious destiny and the self-sufficiency of genius.
   Secure in the ties of a constancy rare even then, he had worked and
   risen with thoughts only of the future; still a bachelor, and with a
   perfect intuitive faith that Georgina also was waiting.

   In this faith Dalton was not deceived. Wondering perhaps why no message
   ever came, Georgina found no romance save in her dreams and
   expectations; and in the course of time became busy with the new
   responsibilities brought by her brother's rise to greatness. Alfred's
   growth had not belied the promise of his youth, and the slim boy had
   darted quietly up the steps of science with a speed and permanence
   almost dizzying to contemplate. Lean and ascetic, with steel-rimmed
   pince-nez and pointed brown beard, Dr. Alfred Clarendon was an
   authority at twenty-five and an international figure at thirty.
   Careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of genius, he depended
   vastly on the care and management of his sister, and was secretly
   thankful that her memories of James had kept her from other and more
   tangible alliances.

   Georgina conducted the business and household of the great
   bacteriologist, and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of
   fever. She bore patiently with his eccentricities, calmed his
   occasional bursts of fanaticism, and healed those breaches with his
   friends which now and then resulted from his unconcealed scorn of
   anything less than a single-minded devotion to pure truth and its
   progress. Clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary
   folk; for he never tired of depreciating the service of the individual
   as contrasted with the service of mankind as a whole, and in censuring
   men of learning who mingled domestic life or outside interests with
   their pursuit of abstract science. His enemies called him a bore; but
   his admirers, pausing before the white heat of ecstasy into which he
   would work himself, became almost ashamed of ever having any standards
   or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed knowledge.
   The doctor's travels were extensive and Georgina generally accompanied
   him on the shorter ones. Three times, however, he had taken long, lone
   jaunts to strange and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers
   and half-fabulous plagues; for he knew that it is out of the unknown
   lands of cryptic and immemorial Asia that most of the earth's diseases
   spring. On each of these occasions he had brought back curious
   mementoes which added to the eccentricity of his home, not least among
   which was the needlessly large staff of Thibetan servants picked up
   somewhere in U-tsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard,
   but amidst which Clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of
   black fever. These men, taller than most Thibetans and clearly
   belonging to a stock but little investigated in the outside world, were
   of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder whether the doctor had
   sought to symbolise in them the anatomical models of his college years.
   Their aspect, in the loose black silk robes of Bonpa priests which he
   chose to give them, was grotesque in the highest degree; and there was
   an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced
   their air of fantasy and gave Georgina a queer, awed feeling of having
   stumbled into the pages of Vathek or the Arabian Nights.

   But queerest of all was the general factotum or clinic-man, whom
   Clarendon addressed as Surama, and whom he had brought back with him
   after a long stay in Northern Africa, during which he had studied
   certain odd intermittent fevers among the mysterious Saharan Tuaregs,
   whose descent from the primal race of lost Atlantis is an old
   archaeological rumour. Surama, a man of great intelligence and
   seemingly inexhaustible erudition, was as morbidly lean as the Thibetan
   servants; with swarthy, parchment-like skin drawn so tightly over his
   bald pate and hairless face that every line of the skull stood out in
   ghastly prominence--this death's-head effect being heightened by
   lustrelessly burning black eyes set with a depth which left to common
   visibility only a pair of dark, vacant sockets. Unlike the ideal
   subordinate, he seemed despite his impassive features to spend no
   effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed. Instead, he carried
   about an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement, accompanied at
   certain moments by a deep, guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle
   which has just torn to pieces some furry animal and is ambling away
   toward the sea. His race appeared to be Caucasian, but could not be
   classified more closely than that. Some of Clarendon's friends thought
   he looked like a high-caste Hindoo notwithstanding his accentless
   speech, while many agreed with Georgina--who disliked him--when she
   gave her opinion that a Pharaoh's mummy, if miraculously brought to
   life, would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeleton.

   Dalton, absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from
   Eastern interests through the peculiar self-sufficiency of the old
   West, had not followed the meteoric rise of his former comrade;
   Clarendon had actually heard nothing of one so far outside his chosen
   world of science as the governor. Being of independent and even of
   abundant means, the Clarendons had for many years stuck to their old
   Manhattan mansion in East Nineteenth Street, whose ghosts must have
   looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of Surama and the Thibetans.
   Then, through the doctor's wish to transfer his base of medical
   observation, the great change had suddenly come, and they had crossed
   the continent to take up a secluded life in San Francisco; buying the
   gloomy old Bannister place near Goat Hill, overlooking the bay, and
   establishing their strange household in a rambling, French-roofed relic
   of mid-Victorian design and gold-rush parvenu display, set amidst
   high-walled grounds in a region still half suburban.

   Dr. Clarendon, though better satisfied than in New York, still felt
   cramped for lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological
   theories. Unworldly as he was, he had never thought of using his
   reputation as an influence to gain public appointment; though more and
   more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or
   a charitable institution--a prison, almshouse, or hospital--would give
   him a field of sufficient width to complete his researches and make his
   discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at large.

   Then he had run into James Dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in
   Market Street as the governor was swinging out of the Royal Hotel.
   Georgina had been with him, and an almost instant recognition had
   heightened the drama of the reunion. Mutual ignorance of one another's
   progress had bred long explanation and histories, and Clarendon was
   pleased to find that he had so important an official for a friend.
   Dalton and Georgina, exchanging many a glance, felt more than a trace
   of their youthful tenderness; and a friendship was then and there
   revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of
   confidences.

   James Dalton learned of his old protégé's need for political
   appointment, and sought, true to his protective role of school and
   college days, to devise some means of giving "Little Alf" the needed
   position and scope. He had, it is true, wide appointive powers; but the
   legislature's constant attacks and encroachments forced him to exercise
   these with the utmost discretion. At length, however, scarcely three
   months after the sudden reunion, the foremost institutional medical
   office in the state fell vacant. Weighing all the elements with care,
   and conscious that his friend's achievements and reputation would
   justify the most substantial rewards, the governor felt at last able to
   act. Formalities were few, and on the eighth of November, 189-, Dr.
   Alfred Schuyler Clarendon became medical director of the California
   State Penitentiary at San Quentin.

   II

   In scarcely more than a month the hopes of Dr. Clarendon's admirers
   were amply fulfilled. Sweeping changes in methods brought to the
   prison's medical routine an efficiency never before dreamed of; and
   though the subordinates were naturally not without jealousy, they were
   obliged to admit the magical results of a really great man's
   superintendence. Then came a time where mere appreciation might well
   have grown to devout thankfulness at a providential conjunction of
   time, place, and man; for one morning Dr. Jones came to his new chief
   with a grave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could
   not but identify as that selfsame black fever whose germ Clarendon had
   found and classified.

   Dr. Clarendon shewed no surprise, but kept on at the writing before
   him.

   "I know," he said evenly; "I came across that case yesterday. I'm glad
   you recognised it. Put the man in a separate ward, though I don't
   believe this fever is contagious."

   Dr. Jones, with his own opinion of the malady's contagiousness, was
   glad of this deference to caution; and hastened to execute the order.
   Upon his return Clarendon rose to leave, declaring that he would
   himself take charge of the case alone. Disappointed in his wish to
   study the great man's methods and technique, the junior physician
   watched his chief stride away toward the lone ward where he had placed
   the patient, more critical of the new regime than at any time since
   admiration had displaced his first jealous pangs.

   Reaching the ward, Clarendon entered hastily, glancing at the bed and
   stepping back to see how far Dr. Jones's obvious curiosity might have
   led him. Then, finding the corridor still vacant, he shut the door and
   turned to examine the sufferer. The man was a convict of a peculiarly
   repulsive type, and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony.
   His features were frightfully contracted, and his knees drawn sharply
   up in the mute desperation of the stricken. Clarendon studied him
   closely, raising his tightly shut eyelids, took his pulse and
   temperature, and finally dissolving a tablet in water, forced the
   solution between the sufferer's lips. Before long the height of the
   attack abated, as shewn by the relaxing body and returning normality of
   expression, and the patient began to breathe more easily. Then, by a
   soft rubbing of the ears, the doctor caused the man to open his eyes.
   There was life in them, for they moved from side to side, though they
   lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the image of the soul.
   Clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had brought, feeling
   behind him the power of an all-capable science. He had long known of
   this case, and had snatched the victim from death with the work of a
   moment. Another hour and this man would have gone--yet Jones had seen
   the symptoms for days before discovering them, and having discovered
   them, did not know what to do.

   Man's conquest of disease, however, cannot be perfect. Clarendon,
   assuring the dubious trusty-nurses that the fever was not contagious,
   had had the patient bathed, sponged in alcohol, and put to bed; but was
   told the next morning that the case was lost. The man had died after
   midnight in the most intense agony, and with such cries and distortions
   of face that the nurses were driven almost to panic. The doctor took
   this news with his usual calm, whatever his scientific feelings may
   have been, and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime. Then,
   with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders, he made the usual rounds of
   the penitentiary.

   Two days later the prison was hit again. Three men came down at once
   this time, and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever
   epidemic was under way. Clarendon, having adhered so firmly to his
   theory of non-contagiousness, suffered a distinct loss of prestige, and
   was handicapped by the refusal of the trusty-nurses to attend the
   patients. Theirs was not the soul-free devotion of those who sacrifice
   themselves to science and humanity. They were convicts, serving only
   because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy, and when the
   price became too great they preferred to resign the privileges.

   But the doctor was still master of the situation. Consulting with the
   warden and sending urgent messages to his friend the governor, he saw
   to it that special rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to
   the convicts for the dangerous nursing service; and by this method
   succeeded in getting a very fair quota of volunteers. He was steeled
   for action now, and nothing could shake his poise and determination.
   Additional cases brought only a curt nod, and he seemed a stranger to
   fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone
   home of sadness and evil. More than forty cases developed within
   another week, and nurses had to be brought from the city. Clarendon
   went home very seldom at this stage, often sleeping on a cot in the
   warden's quarters, and always giving himself up with typical abandon to
   the service of medicine and of mankind.

   Then came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse
   San Francisco. News will out, and the menace of black fever spread over
   the town like a fog from the bay. Reporters trained in the doctrine of
   "sensation first" used their imagination without restraint, and gloried
   when at last they were able to produce a case in the Mexican quarter
   which a local physician--fonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic
   welfare--pronounced black fever.

   That was the last straw. Frantic at the thought of the crawling death
   so close upon them, the people of San Francisco went mad en masse, and
   embarked upon that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to
   hear over busy wires. Ferries and rowboats, excursion steamers and
   launches, railways and cable cars, bicycles and carriages, moving-vans
   and work carts, all were pressed into instant and frenzied service.
   Sausalito and Tamalpais, as lying in the direction of San Quentin,
   shared in the flight; while housing space in Oakland, Berkeley, and
   Alameda rose to fabulous prices. Tent colonies sprang up, and
   improvised villages lined the crowded southward highways from Millbrae
   to San Jose. Many sought refuge with friends in Sacramento, while the
   fright-shaken residue forced by various causes to stay behind could do
   little more than maintain the basic necessities of a nearly dead city.

   Business, save for quack doctors with "sure cures" and "preventives"
   for use against the fever, fell rapidly to the vanishing-point. At
   first the saloons offered "medicated drinks", but soon found that the
   populace preferred to be duped by charlatans of more professional
   aspect. In strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one
   another's faces to glimpse possible plague symptoms, and shopkeepers
   began more and more to refuse admission to their clientele, each
   customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace. Legal and judicial
   machinery began to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks
   succumbed one by one to the urge for flight. Even the doctors deserted
   in large numbers, many of them pleading the need of vacations among the
   mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the state. Schools and
   colleges, theatres and cafés, restaurants and saloons, all gradually
   closed their doors; and in a single week San Francisco lay prostrate
   and inert with only its light, power, and water service even half
   normal, with newspapers in skeletonic form, and with a crippled parody
   on transportation maintained by the horse and cable cars.

   This was the lowest ebb. It could not last long, for courage and
   observation are not altogether dead in mankind; and sooner or later the
   non-existence of any widespread black fever epidemic outside San
   Quentin became too obvious a fact to deny, notwithstanding several
   actual cases and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary
   suburban tent colonies. The leaders and editors of the community
   conferred and took action, enlisting in their service the very
   reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble, but
   now turning their "sensation first" avidity into more constructive
   channels. Editorials and fictitious interviews appeared, telling of Dr.
   Clarendon's complete control of the disease, and of the absolute
   impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison walls. Reiteration and
   circulation slowly did their work, and gradually a slim backward
   trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous refluent stream. One of
   the first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversy of
   the approved acrimonious kind, attempting to fix blame for the panic
   wherever the various participants thought it belonged. The returning
   doctors, jealously strengthened by their timely vacations, began
   striking at Clarendon, assuring the public that they as well as he
   would keep the fever in leash, and censuring him for not doing even
   more to check its spread within San Quentin.

   Clarendon had, they averred, permitted far more deaths than were
   necessary. The veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever
   contagion; and if this renowned savant did not do it, it was clearly
   because he chose for scientific reasons to study the final effects of
   the disease, rather than to prescribe properly and save the victims.
   This policy, they insinuated, might be proper enough among convicted
   murderers in a penal institution, but it would not do in San Francisco,
   where life was still a precious and sacred thing. Thus they went on,
   and the papers were glad to publish all they wrote, since the sharpness
   of the campaign, in which Dr. Clarendon would doubtless join, would
   help to obliterate confusion and restore confidence among the people.

   But Clarendon did not reply. He only smiled, while his singular
   clinic-man Surama indulged in many a deep, testudinous chuckle. He was
   at home more nowadays, so that reporters began besieging the gate of
   the great wall the doctor had built around his house, instead of
   pestering the warden's office at San Quentin. Results, though, were
   equally meagre; for Surama formed an impassable barrier between the
   doctor and the outer world--even after the reporters had got into the
   grounds. The newspaper men getting access to the front hall had
   glimpses of Clarendon's singular entourage and made the best they could
   in a "write-up" of Surama and the queer skeletonic Thibetans.
   Exaggeration, of course, occurred in every fresh article, and the net
   effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician.
   Most persons hate the unusual, and hundreds who could have excused
   heartlessness or incompetence stood ready to condemn the grotesque
   taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eight black-robed
   Orientals.

   Early in January an especially persistent young man from the Observer
   climbed the moated eight-foot brick wall in the rear of the Clarendon
   grounds and began a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which
   trees concealed from the front walk. With quick, alert brain he took in
   everything--the rose-arbour, the aviaries, the animal cages where all
   sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guinea-pigs might be seen and heard,
   the stout wooden clinic building with barred windows in the northwest
   corner of the yard--and bent searching glances throughout the thousand
   square feet of intramural privacy. A great article was brewing, and he
   would have escaped unscathed but for the barking of Dick, Georgina
   Clarendon's gigantic and beloved St. Bernard. Surama, instant in his
   response, had the youth by the collar before a protest could be
   uttered, and was presently shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat, and
   dragging him through the trees to the front yard and the gate.

   Breathless explanations and quavering demands to see Dr. Clarendon were
   useless. Surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on. Suddenly a
   positive fright crept over the dapper scribe, and he began to wish
   desperately that this unearthly creature would speak if only to prove
   that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this
   planet. He became deathly sick, and strove not to glimpse the eyes
   which he knew must lie at the base of those gaping black sockets. Soon
   he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through; in
   another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly
   and muddily in the ditch which Clarendon had had dug around the entire
   length of the wall. Fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive
   gate slam shut, and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the
   forbidding portal. Then, as he turned to go, a soft sound grated behind
   him, and through a small wicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of
   Surama and heard the echoes of a deep-voiced, blood-freezing chuckle.

   This young man, feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been
   rougher than he deserved, resolved to revenge himself upon the
   household responsible for his treatment. Accordingly he prepared a
   fictitious interview with Dr. Clarendon, supposed to be held in the
   clinic building, during which he was careful to describe the agonies of
   a dozen black fever patients whom his imagination ranged on orderly
   rows of couches. His master-stroke was the picture of one especially
   pathetic sufferer gasping for water, while the doctor held a glass of
   the sparkling fluid just out of his reach, in a scientific attempt to
   determine the effect of a tantalising emotion on the course of the
   disease. This invention was followed by paragraphs of insinuating
   comment so outwardly respectful that it bore a double venom. Dr.
   Clarendon was, the article ran, undoubtedly the greatest and most
   single-minded scientist in the world; but science is no friend to
   individual welfare, and one would not like to have one's gravest ills
   drawn out and aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on some
   point of abstract truth. Life is too short for that.

   Altogether, the article was diabolically skilful, and succeeded in
   horrifying nine readers out of ten against Dr. Clarendon and his
   supposed methods. Other papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its
   substance, taking the cue it offered, and commencing a series of
   "faked" interviews which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy. In
   no case, however, did the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction.
   He had no time to waste on fools and liars, and cared little for the
   esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised. When James Dalton
   telegraphed his regrets and offered aid, Clarendon replied with an
   almost boorish curtness. He did not heed the barking of dogs, and could
   not bother to muzzle them. Nor would he thank anyone for messing with a
   matter wholly beneath notice. Silent and contemptuous, he continued his
   duties with tranquil evenness.

   But the young reporter's spark had done its work. San Francisco was
   insane again, and this time as much with rage as with fear. Sober
   judgment became a lost art; and though no second exodus occurred, there
   ensued a reign of vice and recklessness born of desperation, and
   suggesting parallel phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence. Hatred
   ran riot against the man who had found the disease and was struggling
   to restrain it, and a light-headed public forgot his great services to
   knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment. They
   seemed, in their blindness, to hate him in person, rather than the
   plague which had come to their breeze-cleaned and usually healthy city.

   Then the young reporter, playing in the Neronic fire he had kindled,
   added a crowning personal touch of his own. Remembering the indignities
   he had suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinic-man, he prepared
   a masterly article on the home and environment of Dr. Clarendon, giving
   especial prominence to Surama, whose very aspect he declared sufficient
   to scare the healthiest person into any sort of fever. He tried to make
   the gaunt chuckler appear equally ridiculous and terrible, succeeding
   best, perhaps, in the latter half of his intention, since a tide of
   horror always welled up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to
   the creature. He collected all the rumours current about the man,
   elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputed scholarship, and hinted
   darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and
   aeon-weighted Africa wherein Dr. Clarendon had found him.

   Georgina, who followed the papers closely, felt crushed and hurt by
   these attacks upon her brother, but James Dalton, who called often at
   the house, did his best to comfort her. In this he was warm and
   sincere; for he wished not only to console the woman he loved, but to
   utter some measure of the reverence he had always felt for the
   starward-bound genius who had been his youth's closest comrade. He told
   Georgina how greatness can never be exempted from the shafts of envy,
   and cited the long, sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar
   heels. The attacks, he pointed out, formed the truest of all proofs of
   Alfred's solid eminence.

   "But they hurt just the same," she rejoined, "and all the more because
   I know that Al really suffers from them, no matter how indifferent he
   tries to be."

   Dalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among well-born
   persons.

   "And it hurts me a thousand times more, knowing that it hurts you and
   Alf. But never mind, Georgie, we'll stand together and pull through
   it!"

   Thus it came about that Georgina came more and more to rely on the
   strength of the steel-firm, square-jawed governor who had been her
   youthful swain, and more and more to confide in him the things she
   feared. The press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all. There
   were aspects of the household which she did not like. Surama, cruel in
   equal measure to man and beast, filled her with the most unnamable
   repulsion; and she could not but feel that he meant some vague,
   indefinable harm to Alfred. She did not like the Thibetans, either, and
   thought it very peculiar that Surama was able to talk with them. Alfred
   would not tell her who or what Surama was, but had once explained
   rather haltingly that he was a much older man than would be commonly
   thought credible, and that he had mastered secrets and been through
   experiences calculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for
   any scientist seeking Nature's hidden mysteries.

   Urged by her uneasiness, Dalton became a still more frequent visitor at
   the Clarendon home, though he saw that his presence was deeply resented
   by Surama. The bony clinic-man formed the habit of glaring peculiarly
   from those spectral sockets when admitting him, and would often, after
   closing the gate when he left, chuckle monotonously in a manner that
   made his flesh creep. Meanwhile Dr. Clarendon seemed oblivious of
   everything save his work at San Quentin, whither he went each day in
   his launch--alone save for Surama, who managed the wheel while the
   doctor read or collated his notes. Dalton welcomed these regular
   absences, for they gave him constant opportunities to renew his suit
   for Georgina's hand. When he would overstay and meet Alfred, however,
   the latter's greeting was always friendly despite his habitual reserve.
   In time the engagement of James and Georgina grew to be a definite
   thing, and the two awaited only a favourable chance to speak to Alfred.

   The governor, whole-souled in everything and firm in his protective
   loyalty, spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friend's
   behalf. Press and officialdom both felt his influence, and he even
   succeeded in interesting scientists in the East, many of whom came to
   California to study the plague and investigate the anti-fever bacillus
   which Clarendon was so rapidly isolating and perfecting. These doctors
   and biologists, however, did not obtain the information they wished; so
   that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression. Not a few
   prepared articles hostile to Clarendon, accusing him of an unscientific
   and fame-seeking attitude, and intimating that he concealed his methods
   through a highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profit.

   Others, fortunately, were more liberal in their judgments, and wrote
   enthusiastically of Clarendon and his work. They had seen the patients,
   and could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in
   leash. His secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite
   justifiable, since its public diffusion in unperfected form could not
   but do more harm than good. Clarendon himself, whom many of their
   number had met before, impressed them more profoundly than ever, and
   they did not hesitate to compare him with Jenner, Lister, Koch,
   Pasteur, Metchnikoff, and the rest of those whose whole lives have
   served pathology and humanity. Dalton was careful to save for Alfred
   all the magazines that spoke well of him, bringing them in person as an
   excuse to see Georgina. They did not, however, produce much effect save
   a contemptuous smile; and Clarendon would generally throw them to
   Surama, whose deep, disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a close
   parallel to the doctor's own ironic amusement.

   One Monday evening early in February Dalton called with the definite
   intention of asking Clarendon for his sister's hand. Georgina herself
   admitted him to the grounds, and as they walked toward the house he
   stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore
   paws on his breast. It was Dick, Georgina's cherished St. Bernard, and
   Dalton was glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which
   meant so much to her.

   Dick was excited and glad, and turned the governor nearly half about
   with his vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off
   through the trees toward the clinic. He did not vanish, though, but
   presently stopped and looked back, softly barking again as if he wished
   Dalton to follow. Georgina, fond of obeying her huge pet's playful
   whims, motioned to James to see what he wanted; and they both walked
   slowly after him as he trotted relievedly to the rear of the yard where
   the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the stars
   above the great brick wall.

   The outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark
   window-curtains so they knew that Alfred and Surama were at work.
   Suddenly from the interior came a thin, subdued sound like a cry of a
   child--a plaintive call of "Mamma! Mamma!" at which Dick barked, while
   James and Georgina started perceptibly. Then Georgina smiled,
   remembering the parrots that Clarendon always kept for experimental
   uses, and patted Dick on the head either to forgive him for having
   fooled her and Dalton, or to console him for having been fooled
   himself.

   As they turned slowly toward the house Dalton mentioned his resolve to
   speak to Alfred that evening about their engagement, and Georgina
   supplied no objection. She knew that her brother would not relish the
   loss of a faithful manager and companion, but believed his affection
   would place no barrier in the way of her happiness.

   Later that evening Clarendon came into the house with a springy step
   and aspect less grim than usual. Dalton, seeing a good omen in this
   easy buoyancy, took heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial
   "Ah, Jimmy, how's politics this year?" He glanced at Georgina, and she
   quietly excused herself, while the two men settled down to a chat on
   general subjects. Little by little, amidst many reminders of their old
   youthful days, Dalton worked toward his point; till at last he came out
   plainly with the crucial query.

   "Alf, I want to marry Georgina. Have we your blessing?"

   Keenly watching his old friend, Dalton saw a shadow steal over his
   face. The dark eyes flashed for a moment, then veiled themselves as
   wonted placidity returned. So science or selfishness was at work after
   all!

   "You're asking an impossibility, James. Georgina isn't the aimless
   butterfly she was years ago. She has a place in the service of truth
   and mankind now, and that place is here. She's decided to devote her
   life to my work--to the household that makes my work possible--and
   there's no room for desertion or personal caprice."

   Dalton waited to see if he had finished. The same old
   fanaticism--humanity versus the individual--and the doctor was going to
   let it spoil his sister's life! Then he tried to answer.

   "But look here, Alf, do you mean to say that Georgina, in particular,
   is so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr of
   her? Use your sense of proportion, man! If it were a question of Surama
   or somebody in the utter thick of your experiments it might be
   different; but after all, Georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the
   last analysis. She has promised to be my wife and says that she loves
   me. Have you the right to cut her off from the life that belongs to
   her? Have you the right--"

   "That'll do, James!" Clarendon's face was set and white. "Whether or
   not I have the right to govern my own family is no business of an
   outsider."

   "Outsider--you can say that to a man who--" Dalton almost choked as the
   steely voice of the doctor interrupted him again.

   "An outsider to my family, and from now on an outsider to my home.
   Dalton, your presumption goes just a little too far! Good evening,
   Governor!"

   And Clarendon strode from the room without extending his hand.

   Dalton hesitated for a moment, almost at a loss what to do, when
   presently Georgina entered. Her face shewed that she had spoken with
   her brother, and Dalton took both her hands impetuously.

   "Well, Georgie, what do you say? I'm afraid it's a choice between Alf
   and me. You know how I feel--you know how I felt before, when it was
   your father I was up against. What's your answer this time?"

   He paused as she responded slowly.

   "James, dear, do you believe that I love you?"

   He nodded and pressed her hands expectantly.

   "Then, if you love me, you'll wait a while. Don't think of Al's
   rudeness. He's to be pitied. I can't tell you the whole thing now, but
   you know how worried I am--what with the strain of his work, the
   criticisms, and the staring and cackling of that horrible creature
   Surama! I'm afraid he'll break down--he shews the strain more than
   anyone outside the family could tell. I can see it, for I've watched
   him all my life. He's changing--slowly bending under his burdens--and
   he puts on his extra brusqueness to hide it. You can see what I mean,
   can't you, dear?"

   She paused, and Dalton nodded again, pressing one of her hands to his
   breast. Then she concluded.

   "So promise me, dear, to be patient. I must stand by him; I must! I
   must!"

   Dalton did not speak for a while, but his head inclined in what was
   almost a bow of reverence. There was more of Christ in this devoted
   woman than he had thought any human being possessed; and in the face of
   such love and loyalty he could do no urging.

   Words of sadness and parting were brief; and James, whose blue eyes
   were misty, scarcely saw the gaunt clinic-man as the gate to the street
   was at last opened to him. But when it slammed to behind him he heard
   that blood-curdling chuckle he had come to recognise so well, and knew
   that Surama was there--Surama, whom Georgina had called her brother's
   evil genius. Walking away with a firm step, Dalton resolved to be
   watchful, and to act at the first sign of trouble.

   III

   Meanwhile San Francisco, the epidemic still on the lips of all, seethed
   with anti-Clarendon feeling. Actually the cases outside the
   penitentiary were very few, and confined almost wholly to the lower
   Mexican element whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitation to
   disease of every kind; but politicians and the people needed no more
   than this to confirm the attacks made by the doctor's enemies. Seeing
   that Dalton was immovable in his championship of Clarendon, the
   malcontents, medical dogmatists, and ward-heelers turned their
   attention to the state legislature; lining up the anti-Clarendonists
   and the governor's old enemies with great shrewdness, and preparing to
   launch a law--with a veto-proof majority--transferring the authority
   for minor institutional appointments from the chief executive to the
   various boards or commissions concerned.

   In the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than
   Clarendon's chief assistant, Dr. Jones. Jealous of his superior from
   the first, he now saw an opportunity for turning matters to his liking;
   and he thanked fate for the circumstance--responsible indeed for his
   present position--of his relationship to the chairman of the prison
   board. The new law, if passed, would certainly mean the removal of
   Clarendon and the appointment of himself in his stead; so, mindful of
   his own interest, he worked hard for it. Jones was all that Clarendon
   was not--a natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served
   his own advancement first and science only incidentally. He was poor,
   and avid for salaried position, quite in contrast to the wealthy and
   independent savant he sought to displace. So with a rat-like cunning
   and persistence he laboured to undermine the great biologist above him,
   and was one day rewarded by the news that the new law was passed.
   Thenceforward the governor was powerless to make appointments to the
   state institutions, and the medical directorship of San Quentin lay at
   the disposal of the prison board.

   Of all this legislative turmoil Clarendon was singularly oblivious.
   Wrapped wholly in matters of administration and research, he was blind
   to the treason of "that ass Jones" who worked by his side, and deaf to
   all the gossip of the warden's office. He had never in his life read
   the newspapers, and the banishment of Dalton from his house cut off his
   last real link with the world of outside events. With the naiveté of a
   recluse, he at no time thought of his position as insecure. In view of
   Dalton's loyalty, and of his forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs,
   as shewn in his dealings with the elder Clarendon who had crushed his
   father to death on the stock exchange, the possibility of a
   gubernatorial dismissal was, of course, out of the question; nor could
   the doctor's political ignorance envisage a sudden shift of power which
   might place the matter of retention or dismissal in very different
   hands. Thereupon he merely smiled with satisfaction when Dalton left
   for Sacramento; convinced that his place in San Quentin and his
   sister's place in his household were alike secure from disturbance. He
   was accustomed to having what he wanted, and fancied his luck was still
   holding out.

   The first week in March, a day or so after the enactment of the new
   law, the chairman of the prison board called at San Quentin. Clarendon
   was out, but Dr. Jones was glad to shew the august visitor--his own
   uncle, incidentally--through the great infirmary, including the fever
   ward made so famous by press and panic. By this time converted against
   his will to Clarendon's belief in the fever's non-contagiousness, Jones
   smilingly assured his uncle that nothing was to be feared, and
   encouraged him to inspect the patients in detail--especially a ghastly
   skeleton, once a very giant of bulk and vigour, who was, he insinuated,
   slowly and painfully dying because Clarendon would not administer the
   proper medicine.

   "Do you mean to say," cried the chairman, "that Dr. Clarendon refuses
   to let the man have what he needs, knowing his life could be saved?"
   "Just that," snapped Dr. Jones, pausing as the door opened to admit
   none other than Clarendon himself. Clarendon nodded coldly to Jones and
   surveyed the visitor, whom he did not know, with disapproval.

   "Dr. Jones, I thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at
   all. And haven't I said that visitors aren't to be admitted except by
   special permission?"

   But the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce him.

   "Pardon me, Dr. Clarendon, but am I to understand that you refuse to
   give this man the medicine that would save him?" Clarendon glared
   coldly, and rejoined with steel in his voice.

   "That's an impertinent question, sir. I am in authority here, and
   visitors are not allowed. Please leave the room at once."

   The chairman, his sense of drama secretly tickled, answered with
   greater pomp and hauteur than were necessary.

   "You mistake me, sir! I, not you, am master here. You are addressing
   the chairman of the prison board. I must say, moreover, that I deem
   your activity a menace to the welfare of the prisoners, and must
   request your resignation. Henceforth Dr. Jones will be in charge, and
   if you wish to remain until your formal dismissal you will take your
   orders from him."

   It was Wilfred Jones's great moment. Life never gave him another such
   climax, and we need not grudge him this one. After all, he was a small
   rather than a bad man, and he had only obeyed a small man's code of
   looking to himself at all costs. Clarendon stood still, gazing at the
   speaker as if he thought him mad, till in another second the look of
   triumph on Dr. Jones's face convinced him that something important was
   indeed afoot. He was icily courteous as he replied.

   "No doubt you are what you claim to be, sir. But fortunately my
   appointment came from the governor of the state, and can therefore be
   revoked only by him."

   The chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly, for they had not
   realised to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go. Then the older
   man, grasping the situation, explained at some length.

   "Had I found that the current reports did you an injustice," he
   concluded, "I would have deferred action; but the case of this poor man
   and your own arrogant manner left me no choice. As it is--"

   But Dr. Clarendon interrupted with a new razor-sharpness in his voice.

   "As it is, I am the director in charge at present, and I ask you to
   leave this room at once."

   The chairman reddened and exploded.

   "Look here, sir, who do you think you're talking to? I'll have you
   chucked out of here--damn your impertinence!"

   But he had time only to finish the sentence. Transformed by the insult
   to a sudden dynamo of hate, the slender scientist launched out with
   both fists in a burst of preternatural strength of which no one would
   have thought him capable. And if his strength was preternatural, his
   accuracy of aim was no less so; for not even a champion of the ring
   could have wrought a neater result. Both men--the chairman and Dr.
   Jones--were squarely hit; the one full in the face and the other on the
   point of the chin. Going down like felled trees, they lay motionless
   and unconscious on the floor; while Clarendon, now clear and completely
   master of himself, took his hat and cane and went out to join Surama in
   the launch. Only when seated in the moving boat did he at last give
   audible vent to the frightful rage that consumed him. Then, with face
   convulsed, he called down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs
   beyond the stars; so that even Surama shuddered, made an elder sign
   that no book of history records, and forgot to chuckle.

   IV

   Georgina soothed her brother's hurt as best she could. He had come home
   mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library
   lounge; and in that gloomy room, little by little, the faithful sister
   had taken in the almost incredible news. Her consolations were
   instantaneous and tender, and she made him realise how vast, though
   unconscious, a tribute to his greatness the attacks, persecution, and
   dismissal all were. He had tried to cultivate the indifference she
   preached, and could have done so had personal dignity alone been
   involved. But the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could
   calmly bear, and he sighed again and again as he repeated how three
   months more of study in the prison might have given him at last the
   long-sought bacillus which would make all fever a thing of the past.

   Then Georgina tried another mode of cheering, and told him that surely
   the prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate,
   or if it broke out with increased force. But even this was ineffective,
   and Clarendon answered only in a string of bitter, ironic, and
   half-meaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how
   deeply despair and resentment had bitten.

   "Abate? Break out again? Oh, it'll abate all right! At least, they'll
   think it has abated. They'd think anything, no matter what happens!
   Ignorant eyes see nothing, and bunglers are never discoverers. Science
   never shews her face to that sort. And they call themselves doctors!
   Best of all, fancy that ass Jones in charge!"

   Ceasing with a quick sneer, he laughed so daemoniacally that Georgina
   shivered.

   The days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the Clarendon mansion
   Depression, stark and unrelieved, had taken hold of the doctor's
   usually tireless mind; and he would even have refused food had not
   Georgina forced it upon him. His great notebook of observations lay
   unopened on the library table, and his little gold syringe of
   anti-fever serum--a clever device of his own, with a self-contained
   reservoir, attached to a broad gold finger ring, and single-pressure
   action peculiar to itself--rested idly in a small leather case beside
   it. Vigour, ambition, and the desire for study and observation seemed
   to have died within him; and he made no inquiries about his clinic,
   where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderly phials awaiting
   his attention.

   The countless animals held for experiments played, lively and well fed,
   in the early spring sunshine; and as Georgina strolled out through the
   rose-arbour to the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of
   happiness about her. She knew, though, how tragically transient that
   happiness must be; since the start of new work would soon make all
   these small creatures unwilling martyrs to science. Knowing this, she
   glimpsed a sort of compensating element in her brother's inaction, and
   encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly. The eight
   Thibetan servants moved noiselessly about, each as impeccably effective
   as usual; and Georgina saw to it that the order of the household did
   not suffer because of the master's relaxation.

   Study and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressing-gowned
   indifference, Clarendon was content to let Georgina treat him as an
   infant. He met her maternal fussiness with a slow, sad smile, and
   always obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts. A kind of faint,
   wistful felicity came over the languid household, amidst which the only
   dissenting note was supplied by Surama. He indeed was miserable, and
   looked often with sullen and resentful eyes at the sunny serenity in
   Georgina's face. His only joy had been the turmoil of experiment, and
   he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals, bearing them to the
   clinic in clutching talons, and watching them with hot brooding gaze
   and evil chuckles as they gradually fell into the final coma with
   wide-opened, red-rimmed eyes, and swollen tongue lolling from
   froth-covered mouth.

   Now he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree
   creatures in their cages, and frequently came to ask Clarendon if there
   were any orders. Finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin
   work, he would go away muttering under his breath and glaring curses
   upon everything; stealing with cat-like tread to his own quarters in
   the basement, where his voice would sometimes ascend in deep, muffled
   rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortably ritualistic
   suggestion.

   All this wore on Georgina's nerves, but not by any means so gravely as
   her brother's continued lassitude itself. The duration of the state
   alarmed her, and little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness
   which had so provoked the clinic-man. Herself skilled in medicine, she
   found the doctor's condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienist's
   point of view; and she now feared as much from his absence of interest
   and activity as she had formerly feared from his fanatical zeal and
   overstudy. Was lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant
   man of intellect into an innocuous imbecile?

   Then, toward the end of May, came the sudden change. Georgina always
   recalled the smallest details connected with it; details as trivial as
   the box delivered to Surama the day before, postmarked Algiers, and
   emitting a most unpleasant odour; and the sharp, sudden thunderstorm,
   rare in the extreme for California, which sprang up that night as
   Surama chanted his rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning
   chest-voice louder and more intense than usual.

   It was a sunny day, and she had been in the garden gathering flowers
   for the dining-room. Re-entering the house, she glimpsed her brother in
   the library, fully dressed and seated at the table, alternately
   consulting the notes in his thick observation book, and making fresh
   entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen. He was alert and vital,
   and there was a satisfying resilience about his movements as he now and
   then turned a page, or reached for a book from the rear of the great
   table. Delighted and relieved, Georgina hastened to deposit her flowers
   in the dining-room and return; but when she reached the library again
   she found that her brother was gone.

   She knew, of course, that he must be in the clinic at work, and
   rejoiced to think that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into
   place. Realising it would be of no use to delay the luncheon for him,
   she ate alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in case of his
   return at an odd moment. But he did not come. He was making up for lost
   time, and was still in the great stout-planked clinic when she went for
   a stroll through the rose-arbour.

   As she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw Surama fetching
   animals for the test. She wished she could notice him less, for he
   always made her shudder; but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and
   ears where he was concerned. He always went hatless around the yard,
   and the total hairlessness of his head enhanced his skeleton-like
   aspect horribly. Now she heard a faint chuckle as he took a small
   monkey from its cage against the wall and carried it to the clinic, his
   long, bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it
   cried out in frightened anguish. The sight sickened her, and brought
   her walk to an end. Her inmost soul rebelled at the ascendancy this
   creature had gained over her brother, and she reflected bitterly that
   the two had almost changed places as master and servant.

   Night came without Clarendon's return to the house, and Georgina
   concluded that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions,
   which meant total disregard of time. She hated to retire without a talk
   with him about his sudden recovery; but finally, feeling it would be
   futile to wait up, she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his
   chair on the library table; then started resolutely for bed. She was
   not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut. So it had
   not been an all-night session after all! Determined to see that her
   brother had a meal before retiring she rose, slipped on a robe, and
   descended to the library, halting only when she heard voices from
   behind the half-opened door. Clarendon and Surama were talking, and she
   waited till the clinic-man might go.

   Surama, however, shewed no inclination to depart; and indeed, the whole
   heated tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise
   length. Georgina, though she had not meant to listen, could not help
   catching a phrase now and then, and presently became aware of a
   sinister undercurrent which frightened her very much without being
   wholly clear to her. Her brother's voice, nervous, incisive, held her
   notice with disquieting persistence.

   "But anyway," he was saying, "we haven't enough animals for another
   day, and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short
   notice. It seems silly to waste so much effort on comparative trash
   when human specimens could be had with just a little extra care."
   Georgina sickened at the possible implication, and caught at the hall
   rack to steady herself. Surama was replying in that deep, hollow tone
   which seemed to echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand
   planets.

   "Steady, steady--what a child you are with your haste and impatience!
   You crowd things so! When you've lived as I have, so that a whole life
   will seem only an hour, you won't be so fretful about a day or week or
   month! You work too fast. You've plenty of specimens in the cages for a
   full week if you'll only go at a sensible rate. You might even begin on
   the older material if you'd be sure not to overdo it." "Never mind my
   haste!" the reply was snapped out sharply; "I have my own methods. I
   don't want to use our material if I can help it, for I prefer them as
   they are. And you'd better be careful of them anyway--you know the
   knives those sly dogs carry." Surama's deep chuckle came.

   "Don't worry about that. The brutes eat, don't they? Well, I can get
   you one any time you need it. But go slow--with the boy gone, there are
   only eight, and now that you've lost San Quentin it'll be hard to get
   new ones by the wholesale. I'd advise you to start in on Tsanpo--he's
   the least use to you as he is, and--"

   But that was all Georgina heard. Transfixed by a hideous dread from the
   thoughts this talk excited, she nearly sank to the floor where she
   stood, and was scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her
   room. What was the evil monster Surama planning? Into what was he
   guiding her brother? What monstrous circumstances lay behind these
   cryptic sentences? A thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced
   before her eyes, and she flung herself upon the bed without hope of
   sleep. One thought above the rest stood out with fiendish prominence,
   and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her brain with
   renewed force. Then Nature, kinder than she expected, intervened at
   last. Closing her eyes in a dead faint, she did not awake till morning,
   nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the
   overheard words had brought.

   With the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension. What happens
   in the night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in
   distorted forms, and Georgina could see that her brain must have given
   strange colour to scraps of common medical conversation. To suppose her
   brother--only son of the gentle Frances Schuyler Clarendon--guilty of
   savage sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to
   their blood, and she decided to omit all mention of her trip
   downstairs, lest Alfred ridicule her fantastic notions. When she
   reached the breakfast table she found that Clarendon was already gone,
   and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance
   to congratulate him on his revived activity. Quietly taking the
   breakfast served by stone-deaf old Margarita, the Mexican cook, she
   read the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the
   sitting-room window overlooking the great yard. All was silent out
   there, and she could see that the last of the animal cages had been
   emptied. Science was served, and the lime-pit held all that was left of
   the once pretty and lively little creatures. This slaughter had always
   grieved her, but she had never complained, since she knew it was all
   for humanity. Being a scientist's sister, she used to say to herself,
   was like being the sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen
   from their foes.

   After luncheon Georgina resumed her post by the window, and had been
   busily sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the
   yard caused her to look out in alarm. There, not far from the clinic,
   she saw the ghastly form of Surama, a revolver in his hand, and his
   skull-face twisted into a strange expression as he chuckled at a
   cowering figure robed in black silk and carrying a long Thibetan knife.
   It was the servant Tsanpo, and as she recognised the shrivelled face
   Georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the night before.
   The sun flashed on the polished blade, and suddenly Surama's revolver
   spat once more. This time the knife flew from the Mongol's hand, and
   Surama glanced greedily at his shaking and bewildered prey.

   Then Tsanpo, glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen
   knife, sprang nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinic-man
   and made a dash for the house. Surama, however, was too swift for him,
   and caught him in a single leap, seizing his shoulder and almost
   crushing him. For a moment the Thibetan tried to struggle, but Surama
   lifted him like an animal by the scruff of the neck and bore him off
   toward the clinic. Georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the man in
   his own tongue, and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver
   with fright. Suddenly realising against her own will what was taking
   place, a great horror mastered her and she fainted for the second time
   within twenty-four hours.

   When consciousness returned, the golden light of late afternoon was
   flooding the room. Georgina, picking up her fallen work-basket and
   scattered materials, was lost in a daze of doubt; but finally felt
   convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have been all too
   tragically real. Her worst fears, then, were horrible truths. What to
   do about it, nothing in her experience could tell her; and she was
   vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear. She must talk to him,
   but not now. She could not talk to anybody now. And, thinking
   shudderingly of the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic
   windows, she crept into bed for a long night of anguished
   sleeplessness.

   Rising haggardly on the following day, Georgina saw the doctor for the
   first time since his recovery. He was bustling about preoccupiedly,
   circulating between the house and the clinic, and paying little
   attention to anything besides his work. There was no chance for the
   dreaded interview, and Clarendon did not even notice his sister's
   worn-out aspect and hesitant manner.

   In the evening she heard him in the library, talking to himself in a
   fashion most unusual for him, and she felt that he was under a great
   strain which might culminate in the return of his apathy. Entering the
   room, she tried to calm him without referring to any trying subject,
   and forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him. Finally she asked
   gently what was distressing him, and waited anxiously for his reply,
   hoping to hear that Surama's treatment of the poor Thibetan had
   horrified and outraged him.

   There was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he responded.

   "What's distressing me? Good God, Georgina, what isn't? Look at the
   cages and see if you have to ask again! Cleaned out--milked dry--not a
   cursed specimen left; and a line of the most important bacterial
   cultures incubating in their tubes without a chance to do an ounce of
   good! Days' work wasted--whole programme set back--it's enough to drive
   a man mad! How shall I ever get anywhere if I can't scrape up some
   decent subjects?"

   Georgina stroked his forehead.

   "I think you ought to rest a while, Al dear."

   He moved away.

   "Rest? That's good! That's damn good! What else have I been doing but
   resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last
   fifty or a hundred or a thousand years? Just as I manage to shake off
   the clouds, I have to run short of material--and then I'm told to lapse
   back again into drooling stupefaction! God! And all the while some
   sneaking thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to
   come out ahead of me with the credit for my own work. I'll lose by a
   neck--some fool with the proper specimens will get the prize, when one
   week more with even half-adequate facilities would see me through with
   flying colours!"

   His voice rose querulously, and there was an overtone of mental strain
   which Georgina did not like. She answered softly, yet not so softly as
   to hint at the soothing of a psychopathic case.

   "But you're killing yourself with this worry and tension, and if you're
   dead, how can you do your work?"

   He gave a smile that was almost a sneer.

   "I guess a week or a month--all the time I need--wouldn't quite finish
   me, and it doesn't much matter what becomes of me or any other
   individual in the end. Science is what must be served--science--the
   austere cause of human knowledge. I'm like the monkeys and birds and
   guinea-pigs I use--just a cog in the machine, to be used to the
   advantage of the whole. They had to be killed--I may have to be
   killed--what of it? Isn't the cause we serve worth that and more?"

   Georgina sighed. For a moment she wondered whether, after all, this
   ceaseless round of slaughter really was worth while.

   "But are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to
   humanity to warrant these sacrifices?"

   Clarendon's eyes flashed dangerously.

   "Humanity! What the deuce is humanity? Science! Dolts! Just individuals
   over and over again! Humanity is made for preachers to whom it means
   the blindly credulous. Humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom
   it speaks in terms of dollars and cents. Humanity is made for the
   politician to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his
   advantage. What is humanity? Nothing! Thank God that crude illusion
   doesn't last! What a grown man worships is
   truth--knowledge--science--light--the rending of the veil and the
   pushing back of the shadow. Knowledge, the juggernaut! There is death
   in our own ritual. We must kill--dissect--destroy--and all for the sake
   of discovery--the worship of the ineffable light. The goddess Science
   demands it. We test a doubtful poison by killing. How else? No thought
   for self--just knowledge--the effect must be known."

   His voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion, and Georgina
   shuddered slightly.

   "But this is horrible, Al! You shouldn't think of it that way!"

   Clarendon cackled sardonically, in a manner which stirred odd and
   repugnant associations in his sister's mind.

   "Horrible? You think what I say is horrible? You ought to hear Surama!
   I tell you, things were known to the priests of Atlantis that would
   have you drop dead of fright if you heard a hint of them. Knowledge was
   knowledge a hundred thousand years ago, when our especial forbears were
   shambling about Asia as speechless semi-apes! They know something of it
   in the Hoggar region--there are rumours in the farther uplands of
   Thibet--and once I heard an old man in China calling on Yog-Sothoth--"

   He turned pale, and made a curious sign in the air with his extended
   forefinger. Georgina felt genuinely alarmed, but became somewhat calmer
   as his speech took a less fantastic form.

   "Yes, it may be horrible, but it's glorious too. The pursuit of
   knowledge, I mean. Certainly, there's no slovenly sentiment connected
   with it. Doesn't Nature kill--constantly and remorselessly--and are any
   but fools horrified at the struggle? Killings are necessary. They are
   the glory of science. We learn something from them, and we can't
   sacrifice learning to sentiment. Hear the sentimentalists howl against
   vaccination! They fear it will kill the child. Well, what if it does?
   How else can we discover the laws of disease concerned? As a
   scientist's sister you ought to know better than to prate sentiment.
   You ought to help my work instead of hindering it!"

   "But, Al," protested Georgina, "I haven't the slightest intention of
   hindering your work. Haven't I always tried to help as much as I could?
   I am ignorant, I suppose, and can't help very actively; but at least
   I'm proud of you--proud for my own sake and for the family's sake--and
   I've always tried to smooth the way. You've given me credit for that
   many a time."

   Clarendon looked at her keenly.

   "Yes," he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room, "you're
   right. You've always tried to help as best you knew. You may yet have a
   chance to help still more."

   Georgina, seeing him disappear through the front door, followed him
   into the yard. Some distance away a lantern was shining through the
   trees, and as they approached it they saw Surama bending over a large
   object stretched on the ground. Clarendon, advancing, gave a short
   grunt; but when Georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek.
   It was Dick, the great St. Bernard, and he was lying still with
   reddened eyes and protruding tongue.

   "He's sick, Al!" she cried. "Do something for him, quick!"

   The doctor looked at Surama, who had uttered something in a tongue
   unknown to Georgina.

   "Take him to the clinic," he ordered; "I'm afraid Dick's caught the
   fever."

   Surama took up the dog as he had taken poor Tsanpo the day before, and
   carried him silently to the building near the wall. He did not chuckle
   this time, but glanced at Clarendon with what appeared to be real
   anxiety. It almost seemed to Georgina that Surama was asking the doctor
   to save her pet.

   Clarendon, however, made no move to follow, but stood still for a
   moment and then sauntered slowly toward the house. Georgina, astonished
   at such callousness, kept up a running fire of entreaties on Dick's
   behalf, but it was of no use. Without paying the slightest attention to
   her pleas he made directly for the library and began to read in a large
   old book which had lain face down on the table. She put her hand on his
   shoulder as he sat there, but he did not speak or turn his head. He
   only kept on reading, and Georgina, glancing curiously over his
   shoulder, wondered in what strange alphabet this brass-bound tome was
   written.

   In the cavernous parlour across the hall, sitting alone in the dark a
   quarter of an hour later, Georgina came to her decision. Something was
   gravely wrong--just what, and to what extent, she scarcely dared
   formulate to herself--and it was time that she called in some stronger
   force to help her. Of course it must be James. He was powerful and
   capable, and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing
   to do. He had known Al always, and would understand.

   It was by this time rather late, but Georgina had resolved on action.
   Across the hall the light still shone from the library, and she looked
   wistfully at the doorway as she quietly donned a hat and left the
   house. Outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds, it was only a
   short walk to Jackson Street, where by good luck she found a carriage
   to take her to the Western Union telegraph office. There she carefully
   wrote out a message to James Dalton in Sacramento, asking him to come
   at once to San Francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them
   all.

   V

   Dalton was frankly perplexed by Georgina's sudden message. He had had
   no word from the Clarendons since that stormy February evening when
   Alfred had declared him an outsider to his home; and he in turn had
   studiously refrained from communicating, even when he had longed to
   express sympathy after the doctor's summary ousting from office. He had
   fought hard to frustrate the politicians and keep the appointive power,
   and was bitterly sorry to watch the unseating of a man who, despite
   recent estrangements, still represented to him the ultimate ideal of
   scientific competence.

   Now, with this clearly frightened summons before him, he could not
   imagine what had happened. He knew, though, that Georgina was not one
   to lose her head or send forth a needless alarm; hence he wasted no
   time, but took the Overland which left Sacramento within the hour,
   going at once to his club and sending word to Georgina by a messenger
   that he was in town and wholly at her service. Meanwhile things had
   been quiescent at the Clarendon home, notwithstanding the doctor's
   continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dog's
   condition. Shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening, but for
   the moment there was a lull. Georgina was relieved to get Dalton's
   message and learn that he was close at hand, and sent back word that
   she would call him when necessity arose. Amidst all the gathering
   tension some faint compensating element seemed manifest, and Georgina
   finally decided that it was the absence of the lean Thibetans, whose
   stealthy, sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect had always annoyed
   her. They had vanished all at once; and old Margarita, the sole visible
   servant left in the house, told her they were helping their master and
   Surama at the clinic. The following morning--the twenty-eighth of
   May--long to be remembered--was dark and lowering, and Georgina felt
   the precarious calm wearing thin. She did not see her brother at all,
   but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at something despite the
   lack of specimens he had bewailed. She wondered how poor Tsanpo was
   getting along, and whether he had really been subjected to any serious
   inoculation, but it must be confessed that she wondered more about
   Dick. She longed to know whether Surama had done anything for the
   faithful dog amidst his master's oddly callous indifference. Surama's
   apparent solicitude on the night of Dick's seizure had impressed her
   greatly, giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she had ever had for
   the detested clinic-man. Now, as the day advanced, she found herself
   thinking more and more of Dick; till at last her harassed nerves,
   finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the whole
   horror that lay upon the household, could stand the suspense no longer.

   Up to that time she had always respected Alfred's imperious wish that
   he be never approached or disturbed at the clinic; but as this fateful
   afternoon advanced, her resolution to break through the barrier grew
   stronger and stronger. Finally she set out with determined face,
   crossing the yard and entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden
   structure with the fixed intention of discovering how the dog was or of
   knowing the reason for her brother's secrecy.

   The inner door, as usual, was locked; and behind it she heard voices in
   heated conversation. When her knocking brought no response she rattled
   the knob as loudly as possible, but still the voices argued on
   unheeding. They belonged, of course, to Surama and her brother; and as
   she stood there trying to attract attention she could not help catch
   something of their drift. Fate had made her for the second time an
   eavesdropper, and once more the matter she overheard seemed likely to
   tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds.
   Alfred and Surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence,
   and the purport of their speech was enough to arouse the wildest fears
   and confirm the gravest apprehensions. Georgina shivered as her
   brother's voice mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical
   tension.

   "You, damn you--you're a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me!
   Who started all this, anyway? Did I have any idea of your cursed
   devil-gods and elder world? Did I ever in my life think of your damned
   spaces beyond the stars and your crawling chaos Nyarlathotep? I was a
   normal scientific man, confound you, till I was fool enough to drag you
   out of the vaults with your devilish Atlantean secrets. You egged me
   on, and now you want to cut me off! You loaf around doing nothing and
   telling me to go slow when you might just as well as not be going out
   and getting material. You know damn well that I don't know how to go
   about such things, whereas you must have been an old hand at it before
   the earth was made. It's like you, you damned walking corpse, to start
   something you won't or can't finish!" Surama's evil chuckle came.

   "You're insane, Clarendon. That's the only reason I let you rave on
   when I could send you to hell in three minutes. Enough is enough, and
   you've certainly had enough material for any novice at your stage.
   You've had all I'm going to get you, anyhow! You're only a maniac on
   the subject now--what a cheap, crazy thing to sacrifice even your poor
   sister's pet dog, when you could have spared him as well as not! You
   can't look at any living thing now without wanting to jab that gold
   syringe into it. No--Dick had to go where the Mexican boy went--where
   Tsanpo and the other seven went--where all the animals went! What a
   pupil! You're no fun anymore--you've lost your nerve. You set out to
   control things, and they're controlling you. I'm about done with you,
   Clarendon. I thought you had the stuff in you, but you haven't. It's
   about time I tried somebody else. I'm afraid you'll have to go!"

   In the doctor's shouted reply there was both fear and frenzy.

   "Be careful, you ----! There are powers against your powers--I didn't
   go to China for nothing, and there are things in Alhazred's Azif which
   weren't known in Atlantis! We've both meddled in dangerous things, but
   you needn't think you know all my resources. How about the Nemesis of
   Flame? I talked in Yemen with an old man who had come back alive from
   the Crimson Desert--he had seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had
   worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb--IÄ!
   Shub-Niggurath!"

   Through Clarendon's shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the
   clinic-man.

   "Shut up, you fool! Do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any
   weight with me? Words and formulae--words and formulae--what do they
   all mean to one who has the substance behind them? We're in a material
   sphere now, and subject to material laws. You have your fever; I have
   my revolver. You'll get no specimens, and I'll get no fever so long as
   I have you in front of me with this gun between!"

   That was all Georgina could hear. She felt her senses reeling, and
   staggered out of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering
   outside air. She saw that the crisis had come at last, and that help
   must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be saved from the unknown
   gulfs of madness and mystery. Summoning up all her reserve energy, she
   managed to reach the house and get to the library, where she scrawled a
   hasty note for Margarita to take to James Dalton.

   When the old woman had gone, Georgina had just strength enough to cross
   to the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semi-stupor. There
   she lay for what seemed like years, conscious only of the fantastic
   creeping up of the twilight from the lower corners of the great, dismal
   room, and plagued by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed
   with phantasmal, half-limned pageantry through her tortured and stifled
   brain. Dusk deepened into darkness, and still the spell held. Then a
   firm tread sounded in the hall, and she heard someone enter the room
   and fumble at the match-safe. Her heart almost stopped beating as the
   gas-jets of the chandelier flared up one by one, but then she saw that
   the arrival was her brother. Relieved to the bottom of her heart that
   he was still alive, she gave vent to an involuntary sigh, profound,
   long-drawn, and tremulous, and lapsed at last into kindly oblivion.

   At the sound of that sigh Clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge,
   and was inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of
   his sister there. Her face had a death-like quality that frightened his
   inmost spirit, and he flung himself on his knees by her side, awake to
   a realisation of what her passing away would mean to him. Long unused
   to private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth, he had lost
   the physician's instinct of first aid, and could only call out her name
   and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him. Then
   he thought of water, and ran to the dining-room for a carafe. Stumbling
   about in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors, he was some
   time in finding what he sought; but at last he clutched it in shaking
   hand and hastened back to dash the cold fluid in Georgina's face. The
   method was crude but effective. She stirred, sighed a second time, and
   finally opened her eyes.

   "You are alive!" he cried, and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his
   head maternally. She was almost glad she fainted, for the circumstance
   seemed to have dispelled the strange Alfred and brought her own brother
   back to her. She sat up slowly and tried to reassure him.

   "I'm all right, Al. Just give me a glass of water. It's a sin to waste
   it this way--to say nothing of spoiling my waist! Is that the way to
   behave every time your sister drops off for a nap? You needn't think
   I'm going to be sick, for I haven't time for such nonsense!" Alfred's
   eyes shewed that her cool, common-sense speech had had its effect. His
   brotherly panic dissolved in an instant, and instead there came into
   his face a vague, calculating expression, as if some marvellous
   possibility had just dawned upon him. As she watched the subtle waves
   of cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she
   became less and less certain that her mode of reassurance had been a
   wise one, and before he spoke she found herself shivering at something
   she could not define. A keen medical instinct almost told her that his
   moment of sanity had passed, and that he was now once more the
   unrestrained fanatic for scientific research. There was something
   morbid in the quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mention of good
   health. What was he thinking? To what unnatural extreme was his passion
   for experiment about to be pushed? Wherein lay the special significance
   of her pure blood and absolutely flawless organic state? None of these
   misgivings, however, troubled Georgina for more than a second, and she
   was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her brother's steady
   fingers at her pulse.

   "You're a bit feverish, Georgie," he said in a precise, elaborately
   restrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyes. "Why,
   nonsense, I'm all right," she replied. "One would think you were on the
   watch for fever patients just for the sake of shewing off your
   discovery! It would be poetic, though, if you could make your final
   proof and demonstration by curing your own sister!" Clarendon started
   violently and guiltily. Had she suspected his wish? Had he muttered
   anything aloud? He looked at her closely, and saw that she had no
   inkling of the truth. She smiled up sweetly into his face and patted
   his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge. Then he took a small
   oblong leather case from his vest pocket, and taking out a little gold
   syringe, he began fingering it thoughtfully, pushing the piston
   speculatively in and out of the empty cylinder.

   "I wonder," he began with suave sententiousness, "whether you would
   really be willing to help science in--something like that way--if the
   need arose? Whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to
   the cause of medicine as a sort of Jephthah's daughter if you knew it
   meant the absolute perfection and completion of my work?"

   Georgina, catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brother's
   eyes, knew at last that her worst fears were true. There was nothing to
   do now but keep him quiet at all hazards and to pray that Margarita had
   found James Dalton at his club.

   "You look tired, Al dear," she said gently. "Why not take a little
   morphia and get some of the sleep you need so badly?"

   He replied with a kind of crafty deliberation.

   "Yes, you're right. I'm worn out, and so are you. Each of us needs a
   good sleep. Morphine is just the thing--wait till I go and fill the
   syringe and we'll both take a proper dose."

   Still fingering the empty syringe, he walked softly out of the room.
   Georgina looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation, ears
   alert for any sign of possible help. She thought she heard Margarita
   again in the basement kitchen, and rose to ring the bell, in an effort
   to learn of the fate of her message. The old servant answered her
   summons at once, and declared she had given the message at the club
   hours ago. Governor Dalton had been out, but the clerk had promised to
   deliver the note at the very moment of his arrival. Margarita waddled
   below stairs again, but still Clarendon did not reappear. What was he
   doing? What was he planning? She had heard the outer door slam, so knew
   he must be at the clinic. Had he forgotten his original intention with
   the vacillating mind of madness? The suspense grew almost unbearable,
   and Georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid screaming.

   It was the gate bell, which rang simultaneously in house and clinic,
   that broke the tension at last. She heard the cat-like tread of Surama
   on the walk as he left the clinic to answer it; and then, with an
   almost hysterical sigh of relief, she caught the firm, familiar accents
   of Dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant. Rising, she
   almost tottered to meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway; and
   for a moment no word was spoken while he kissed her hand in his
   courtly, old-school fashion. Then Georgina burst forth into a torrent
   of hurried explanation, telling all that had happened, all she had
   glimpsed and overheard, and all she feared and suspected. Dalton
   listened gravely and comprehendingly, his first bewilderment gradually
   giving place to astonishment, sympathy, and resolution. The message,
   held by a careless clerk, had been slightly delayed, and had found him
   appropriately enough in the midst of a warm lounging-room discussion
   about Clarendon. A fellow-member, Dr. MacNeil, had brought in a medical
   journal with an article well calculated to disturb the devoted
   scientist, and Dalton had just asked to keep the paper for future
   reference when the message was handed him at last. Abandoning his
   half-formed plan to take Dr. MacNeil into his confidence regarding
   Alfred, he called at once for his hat and stick, and lost not a moment
   in getting a cab for the Clarendon home.

   Surama, he thought, appeared alarmed at recognising him; though he had
   chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic. Dalton
   always recalled Surama's stride and chuckle on this ominous night, for
   he was never to see the unearthly creature again. As the chuckler
   entered the clinic vestibule his deep, guttural gurgles seemed to blend
   with some low mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizon.

   When Dalton had heard all Georgina had to say, and learned that Alfred
   was expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine, he
   decided he had better talk with the doctor alone. Advising Georgina to
   retire to her room and await developments, he walked about the gloomy
   library, scanning the shelves and listening for Clarendon's nervous
   footstep on the clinic path outside. The vast room's corners were
   dismal despite the chandelier, and the closer Dalton looked at his
   friend's choice of books the less he liked them. It was not the
   balanced collection of a normal physician, biologist, or man of general
   culture. There were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes;
   dark speculations and forbidden rituals of the Middle Ages, and strange
   exotic mysteries in alien alphabets both known and unknown.

   The great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome, too.
   The handwriting had a neurotic cast, and the spirit of the entries was
   far from reassuring. Long passages were inscribed in crabbed Greek
   characters, and as Dalton marshalled his linguistic memory for their
   translation he gave a sudden start, and wished his college struggles
   with Xenophon and Homer had been more conscientious. There was
   something wrong--something hideously wrong--here, and the governor sank
   limply into the chair by the table as he pored more and more closely
   over the doctor's barbarous Greek. Then a sound came, startlingly near,
   and he jumped nervously at a hand laid sharply on his shoulder.

   "What, may I ask, is the cause of this intrusion? You might have stated
   your business to Surama."

   Clarendon was standing icily by the chair, the little gold syringe in
   one hand. He seemed very calm and rational, and Dalton fancied for a
   moment that Georgina must have exaggerated his condition. How, too,
   could a rusty scholar be absolutely sure about these Greek entries? The
   governor decided to be very cautious in his interview, and thanked the
   lucky chance which had placed a specious pretext in his coat pocket. He
   was very cool and assured as he rose to reply.

   "I didn't think you'd care to have things dragged before a subordinate,
   but I thought you ought to see this article at once."

   He drew forth the magazine given him by Dr. MacNeil and handed it to
   Clarendon.

   On page 542--you see the heading, `Black Fever Conquered by New Serum
   It's by Dr. Miller of Philadelphia--and he thinks he's got ahead of you
   with your cure. They were discussing it at the club, and MacNeil
   thought the exposition very convincing. I, as a layman, couldn't
   pretend to judge; but at all events I thought you oughtn't to miss a
   chance to digest the thing while it's fresh. If you're busy, of course,
   I won't disturb you--"

   Clarendon cut in sharply.

   "I'm going to give my sister an hypodermic--she's not quite well--but
   I'll look at what that quack has to say when I get back. I know
   Miller--a damn sneak and incompetent--and I don't believe he has the
   brains to steal my methods from the little he's seen of them." Dalton
   suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that Georgina must not
   receive that intended dose. There was something sinister about it. From
   what she had said, Alfred must have been inordinately long preparing
   it, far longer than was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet.
   He decided to hold his host as long as possible, meanwhile testing his
   attitude in a more or less subtle way. "I'm sorry Georgina isn't well.
   Are you sure that the injection will do her good? That it won't do her
   any harm?" Clarendon's spasmodic start shewed that something had been
   struck home.

   "Do her harm?" he cried. "Don't be absurd! You know Georgina must be in
   the best of health--the very best, I say--in order to serve science as
   a Clarendon should serve it. She, at least, appreciates the fact that
   she is my sister. She deems no sacrifice too great in my service. She
   is a priestess of truth and discovery, as I am a priest."

   He paused in his shrill tirade, wild-eyed, and somewhat out of breath.
   Dalton could see that his attention had been momentarily shifted. "But
   let me see what this cursed quack has to say," he continued. "If he
   thinks his pseudo-medical rhetoric can take a real doctor in, he is
   even simpler than I thought!"

   Clarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood
   there clutching his syringe. Dalton wondered what the real facts were.
   MacNeil had assured him that the author was a pathologist of the
   highest standing, and that whatever errors the article might have, the
   mind behind it was powerful, erudite, and absolutely honourable and
   sincere.

   Watching the doctor as he read, Dalton saw the thin, bearded face grow
   pale. The great eyes blazed, and the pages crackled in the tenser grip
   of the long, lean fingers. A perspiration broke out on the high,
   ivory-white forehead where the hair was already thinning. and the
   reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept
   on with his devouring of the text. Then came a wild scream as from a
   haunted beast, and Clarendon lurched forward on the table, his outflung
   arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousness went dark
   like a wind-quenched candle-flame.

   Dalton, springing to help his stricken friend, raised the slim form and
   tilted it back in the chair. Seeing the carafe on the floor near the
   lounge, he dashed some water into the twisted face, and was rewarded by
   seeing the large eyes slowly open. They were sane eyes now--deep and
   sad and unmistakably sane--and Dalton felt awed in the presence of a
   tragedy whose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumb.

   The golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand, and as
   Clarendon drew a deep, shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and
   studied the glittering thing that rolled about on his palm. Then he
   spoke--slowly, and with the ineffable sadness of utter, absolute
   despair.

   "Thanks, Jimmy, I'm quite all right. But there's much to be done. You
   asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do Georgie any
   harm. I'm in a position now to tell you that it won't."

   He turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston,
   at the same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own
   neck. Dalton cried out in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand
   injected the contents of the cylinder into the ridge of distended
   flesh.

   "Good Lord, Al, what have you done?"

   Clarendon smiled gently--a smile almost of peace and resignation,
   different indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeks. "You
   ought to know, Jimmy, if you've still the judgment that made you a
   governor. You must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise
   that there's nothing else to do. With your marks in Greek back at
   Columbia I guess you couldn't have missed much. All I can say is that
   it's true.

   "James, I don't like to pass blame along, but it's only right to tell
   you that Surama got me into this. I can't tell you who or what he is,
   for I don't fully know myself, and what I do know is stuff that no sane
   person ought to know; but I will say that I don't consider him a human
   being in the fullest sense, and that I'm not sure whether or not he's
   alive as we know life.

   "You think I'm talking nonsense. I wish I were, but the whole hideous
   mess is damnably real. I started out in life with a clean mind and
   purpose. I wanted to rid the world of fever. I tried and failed--and I
   wish to God I had been honest enough to say that I'd failed. Don't let
   my old talk of science deceive you, James--I found no antitoxin and was
   never even half on the track of one!

   "Don't look so shaken up, old fellow! A veteran politician-fighter like
   you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before. I tell you, I never had
   even the start of a fever cure. But my studies had taken me into some
   queer places, and it was just my damned luck to listen to the stories
   of some still queerer people. James, if you ever wish any man well,
   tell him to keep clear of the ancient, hidden places of the earth. Old
   backwaters are dangerous--things are handed down there that don't do
   healthy people any good. I talked too much with old priests and
   mystics, and got to hoping I might achieve things in dark ways that I
   couldn't achieve in lawful ways.

   "I shan't tell you just what I mean, for if I did I'd be as bad as the
   old priests that were the ruin of me. All I need say is that after what
   I've learned I shudder at the thought of the world and what it's been
   through. The world is cursed old, James, and there have been whole
   chapters lived and closed before the dawn of our organic life and the
   geologic eras connected with it. It's an awful thought--whole forgotten
   cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseases--all
   lived through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the
   tropic seas geology tells us about.

   "I said gone, but I didn't quite mean that. It would have been better
   that way, but it wasn't quite so. In places traditions have kept on--I
   can't tell you how--and certain archaic life-forms have managed to
   struggle thinly down the aeons in hidden spots. There were cults, you
   know--bands of evil priests in lands now buried under the sea. Atlantis
   was the hotbed. That was a terrible place. If heaven is merciful, no
   one will ever drag up that horror from the deep.

   "It had a colony, though, that didn't sink; and when you get too
   confidential with one of the Tuareg priests in Africa, he's likely to
   tell you wild tales about it--tales that connect up with whispers
   you'll hear among the mad lamas and flighty yak-drivers on the secret
   table-lands of Asia. I'd heard all the common tales and whispers when I
   came on the big one. What that was, you'll never know--but it pertained
   to somebody or something that had come down from a blasphemously long
   time ago, and could be made to live again--or seem alive again--through
   certain processes that weren't very clear to the man who told me.

   "Now, James, in spite of my confession about the fever, you know I'm
   not bad as a doctor. I plugged hard at medicine, and soaked up about as
   much as the next man--maybe a little more, because down there in the
   Hoggar country I did something no priest had ever been able to do. They
   led me blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for
   generations--and I came back with Surama.

   "Easy, James! I know what you want to say. How does he know all he
   knows?--why does he speak English--or any other language, for that
   matter--without an accent?--why did he come away with me?--and all
   that. I can't tell you altogether, but I can say that he takes in ideas
   and images and impressions with something besides his brain and senses.
   He had a use for me and my science. He told me things, and opened up
   vistas. He taught me to worship ancient, primordial, and unholy gods,
   and mapped out a road to a terrible goal which I can't even hint to
   you. Don't press me, James--it's for the sake of your sanity and the
   world's sanity!

   "The creature is beyond all bounds. He's in league with the stars and
   all the forces of Nature. Don't think I'm still crazy, James--I swear
   to you I'm not! I've had too many glimpses to doubt. He gave me new
   pleasures that were forms of his palaeogean worship, and the greatest
   of those was the black fever.

   "God, James! Haven't you seen through the business by this time? Do you
   still believe the black fever came out of Thibet, and that I learned
   about it there? Use your brains, man! Look at Miller's article here!
   He's found a basic antitoxin that will end all fever within half a
   century, when other men learn how to modify it for the different forms.
   He's cut the ground of my youth from under me--done what I'd have given
   my life to do--taken the wind out of all the honest sails I ever flung
   to the breeze of science! Do you wonder his article gave me a turn? Do
   you wonder it shocks me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my
   youth? Too late! Too late! But not too late to save others!

   "I guess I'm rambling a bit now, old man. You know--the hypodermic. I
   asked you why you didn't tumble to the facts about black fever. How
   could you, though? Doesn't Miller say he's cured seven cases with his
   serum? A matter of diagnosis, James. He only thinks it is black fever.
   I can read between his lines. Here, old chap, on page 551, is the key
   to the whole thing. Read it again.

   "You see, don't you? The fever cases from the Pacific Coast didn't
   respond to his serum. They puzzled him. They didn't even seem like any
   true fever he knew. Well, those were my cases! Those were the real
   black fever cases! And there can't ever be an antitoxin on earth
   that'll cure black fever!

   "How do I know? Because black fever isn't of this earth! It's from
   somewhere else, James--and Surama alone knows where, because he brought
   it here. He brought it and I spread it! That's the secret, James!
   That's all I wanted the appointment for--that's all I ever did--just
   spread the fever that I carried in this gold syringe and in the
   deadlier finger-ring-pump-syringe you see on my index finger! Science?
   A blind! I wanted to kill, and kill, and kill! A single pressure on my
   finger, and the black fever was inoculated. I wanted to see living
   things writhe and squirm, scream and froth at the mouth. A single
   pressure of the pump-syringe and I could watch them as they died, and I
   couldn't live or think unless I had plenty to watch. That's why I
   jabbed everything in sight with the accursed hollow needle. Animals,
   criminals, children, servants--and the next would have been--"

   Clarendon's voice broke, and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chair.

   "That--that, James--was--my life. Surama made it so--he taught me, and
   kept me at it till I couldn't stop. Then--then it got too much even for
   him. He tried to check me. Fancy--he trying to check anybody in that
   line! But now I've got my last specimen. That is my last test. Good
   subject, James--I'm healthy--devilish healthy. Deuced ironic,
   though--the madness has gone now, so there won't be any fun watching
   the agony! Can't be--can't--"

   A violent shiver of fever racked the doctor, and Dalton mourned amidst
   his horror-stupefaction that he could give no grief. How much of
   Alfred's story was sheer nonsense, and how much nightmare truth he
   could not say; but in any case he felt that the man was a victim rather
   than a criminal, and above all, he was a boyhood comrade and Georgina's
   brother. Thoughts of the old days came back kaleidoscopically. "Little
   Alf"--the yard at Phillips Exeter--the quadrangle at Columbia--the
   fight with Tom Cortland when he saved Alf from a pommeling. . . .

   He helped Clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do.
   There was nothing. Alfred could only whisper now, but he asked
   forgiveness for all his offences, and commended his sister to the care
   of his friend.

   "You--you'll--make her happy," he gasped. "She deserves it.
   Martyr--to--a myth! Make it up to her, James.
   Don't--let--her--know--more--than she has to!"

   His voice trailed off in a mumble, and he fell into a stupor. Dalton
   rang the bell, but Margarita had gone to bed, so he called up the
   stairs for Georgina. She was firm of step, but very pale. Alfred's
   scream had tried her sorely, but she had trusted James. She trusted him
   still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge and asked her
   to go back to her room and rest, no matter what sounds she might hear.
   He did not wish her to witness the awful spectacle of delirium certain
   to come, but bade her kiss her brother a final farewell as he lay there
   calm and still, very like the delicate boy he had once been. So she
   left him--the strange, moonstruck, star-reading genius she had mothered
   so long--and the picture she carried away was a very merciful one.

   Dalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture. His fears of delirium
   were not vain, and all through the black midnight hours his giant
   strength restrained the frenzied contortions of the mad sufferer. What
   he heard from those swollen, blackening lips he will never repeat. He
   has never been quite the same man since, and he knows that no one who
   hears such things can ever be wholly as he was before. So, for the
   world's good, he dares not speak, and he thanks God that his layman's
   ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic and
   meaningless to him.

   Toward morning Clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and
   began to speak in a firm voice.

   "James, I didn't tell you what must be done--about everything. Blot out
   these entries in Greek and send my notebook to Dr. Miller. All my other
   notes, too, that you'll find in the files. He's the big authority
   today--his article proves it. Your friend at the club was right. "But
   everything in the clinic must go. Everything without exception, dead or
   alive or--otherwise. All the plagues of hell are in those bottles on
   the shelves. Burn them--burn it all--if one thing escapes, Surama will
   spread black death throughout the world. And above all burn Surama!
   That--that thing--must not breathe the wholesome air of heaven. You
   know now--what I told you--you know why such an entity can't be allowed
   on earth. It won't be murder--Surama isn't human--if you're as pious as
   you used to be, James, I shan't have to urge you. Remember the old
   text--`Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live'--or something of the
   sort.

   "Burn him, James! Don't let him chuckle again over the torture of
   mortal flesh! I say, burn him--the Nemesis of Flame--that's all that
   can reach him, James, unless you can catch him asleep and drive a stake
   through his heart. . . . Kill him--extirpate him--cleanse the decent
   universe of its primal taint--the taint I recalled from its age-long
   sleep. . . ."

   The doctor had risen on his elbow, and his voice was a piercing shriek
   toward the last. The effort was too much, however, and he lapsed very
   suddenly into a deep, tranquil coma. Dalton, himself fearless of fever,
   since he knew the dread germ to be non-contagious, composed Alfred's
   arms and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragile
   form. After all, mightn't much of this horror be exaggeration and
   delirium? Mightn't old Doc MacNeil pull him through on a long chance?
   The governor strove to keep awake, and walked briskly up and down the
   room, but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures. A
   second's rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands,
   and he was presently sleeping soundly despite his best intentions.

   Dalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes, and for a moment
   he thought the dawn had come. But it was not the dawn, and as he rubbed
   his heavy lids he saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in
   the yard, whose stout planks flamed and roared and crackled heavenward
   in the most stupendous holocaust he had ever seen. It was indeed the
   "Nemesis of Flame" that Clarendon had wished, and Dalton felt that some
   strange combustibles must be involved in a blaze so much wilder than
   anything normal pine or redwood could afford. He glanced alarmedly at
   the lounge, but Alfred was not there. Starting up, he went to call
   Georgina, but met her in the hall, roused as he was by the mountain of
   living fire.

   "The clinic's burning down!" she cried. "How is Al now?"

   "He's disappeared--disappeared while I dropped asleep!" replied Dalton,
   reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to
   sway.

   Gently leading her upstairs toward her room, he promised to search at
   once for Alfred, but Georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from
   outside cast a weird glow through the window on the landing.

   "He must be dead, James--he could never live, sane and knowing what he
   did. I heard him quarrelling with Surama, and know that awful things
   were going on. He is my brother, but--it is best as it is."

   Her voice had sunk to a whisper.

   Suddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep, hideous
   chuckle, and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till
   they half resembled some nameless, Cyclopean creatures of nightmare.
   James and Georgina paused hesitant, and peered out breathlessly through
   the landing window. Then from the sky came a thunderous peal, as a
   forked bolt of lightning shot down with terrible directness into the
   very midst of the blazing ruin. The deep chuckle ceased, and in its
   place came a frantic, ululant yelp as of a thousand ghouls and
   werewolves in torment. It died away with long, reverberant echoes, and
   slowly the flames resumed their normal shape.

   The watchers did not move, but waited till the pillar of fire had
   shrunk to a smouldering glow. They were glad of a half-rusticity which
   had kept the firemen from trooping out, and of the wall that excluded
   the curious. What had happened was not for vulgar eyes--it involved too
   much of the universe's inner secrets for that.

   In the pale dawn, James spoke softly to Georgina, who could do no more
   than put her head on his breast and sob.

   "Sweetheart, I think he has atoned. He must have set the fire, you
   know, while I was asleep. He told me it ought to be burned--the clinic,
   and everything in it, Surama, too. It was the only way to save the
   world from the unknown horrors he had loosed upon it. He knew, and he
   did what was best.

   "He was a great man, Georgie. Let's never forget that. We must always
   be proud of him, for he started out to help mankind, and was titanic
   even in his sins. I'll tell you more sometime. What he did, be it good
   or evil, was what no man ever did before. He was the first and last to
   break through certain veils, and even Apollonius of Tyana takes second
   place beside him. But we mustn't talk about that. We must remember him
   only as the Little Alf we knew--as the boy who wanted to master
   medicine and conquer fever."

   In the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found
   two skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adhering--only two, thanks
   to the undisturbed lime-pits. One was of a man; the other is still a
   subject of debate among the biologists of the coast. It was not exactly
   an ape's or a saurian's skeleton, but it had disturbing suggestions of
   lines of evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace. The
   charred skull, oddly enough, was very human, and reminded people of
   Surama; but the rest of the bones were beyond conjecture. Only well-cut
   clothing could have made such a body look like a man.

   But the human bones were Clarendon's. No one disputed this, and the
   world at large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor
   of his age; the bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have
   far eclipsed Dr. Miller's kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to
   perfection. Much of Miller's late success, indeed, is credited to the
   notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames. Of the old
   rivalry and hatred almost none survived, and even Dr. Wilfred Jones has
   been known to boast of his association with the vanished leader.

   James Dalton and his wife Georgina have always preserved a reticence
   which modesty and family grief might well account for. They published
   certain notes as a tribute to the great man's memory, but have never
   confirmed or contradicted either the popular estimate or the rare hints
   of marvels that a very few keen thinkers have been known to whisper. It
   was very subtly and slowly that the facts filtered out. Dalton probably
   gave Dr. MacNeil an inkling of the truth, and that good soul had not
   many secrets from his son.

   The Daltons have led, on the whole, a very happy life; for their cloud
   of terror lies far in the background, and a strong mutual love has kept
   the world fresh for them. But there are things which disturb them
   oddly--little things, of which one would scarcely ever think of
   complaining. They cannot bear persons who are lean or deep-voiced
   beyond certain limits, and Georgina turns pale at the sound of any
   guttural chuckling. Senator Dalton has a mixed horror of occultism,
   travel, hypodermics, and strange alphabets which most find hard to
   unify, and there are still those who blame him for the vast proportion
   of the doctor's library that he destroyed with such painstaking
   completeness.

   MacNeil, though, seemed to realise. He was a simple man, and he said a
   prayer as the last of Alfred Clarendon's strange books crumbled to
   ashes. Nor would anyone who had peered understandingly within those
   books wish a word of that prayer unsaid.

   boat was brought to a stand still Captain Jones reached out his hand
   for the object which he now discerned to be a glass bottle "Nothing but
   a rum flask that the men on a passing boat threw over" he said but from
   an impulse of curiosity he reached out for it. it was a rum flask & he
   was about to throw it away when he noticed a piece of paper in it. He
   pulled it out & on it read the following Jan 1 1864 I am John Jones who

I. The Shadow On The Chimney[edit]

   There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted
   mansion atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear. I was not
   alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the
   grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests
   for strange horrors in literature and in life. With me were two
   faithful and muscular men for whom I had sent when the time came; men
   long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their
   peculiar fitness.

   We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who
   still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before - the
   nightmare creeping death. Later, I thought, they might aid me; but I
   did not want them then. Would to God I had let them share the search,
   that I might not have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear it
   alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the
   demon implications of the thing. Now that I am telling it anyway, lest
   the brooding make me a maniac, I wish I had never concealed it. For I,
   and I only, know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and
   desolate mountain.

   In a small motor-car we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill
   until the wooded ascent checked it. The country bore an aspect more
   than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the
   accustomed crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to
   use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract. It
   was not a wholesome landscape after dark, and I believe I would have
   noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror that
   stalked there. Of wild creatures there were none-they are wise when
   death leers close. The ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed
   unnaturally large and twisted, and the other vegetation unnaturally
   thick and feverish, while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy,
   fulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men's skulls
   swelled to gigantic proportions.

   Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I
   learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first
   brought the region to the world's notice. The place is a remote, lonely
   elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilization once
   feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a
   few mined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting
   pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited the
   locality till the state police were formed, and even now only
   infrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition
   throughout the neighboring villages; since it is a prime topic in the
   simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys
   to trade handwoven baskets for such primitive necessities as they
   cannot shoot, raise, or make.

   The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion,
   which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent
   thunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred
   years the antique, grove-circled stone house had been the subject of
   stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent
   colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With whimpering
   insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized lone
   wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a
   frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered
   of blood trails toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder
   called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the
   thunder was its voice.

   No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting
   stories, with their incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the
   hall-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the
   Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade such a
   doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such
   investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid
   tale of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense
   spectre; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer
   hereditary dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the
   murder which had cursed it.

   The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous
   confirmation of the mountaineers' wildest legends. One summer night,
   after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence, the countryside was
   aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create. The
   pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror
   which had descended upon them, and they were not doubted. They had not
   seen it, but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they
   knew a creeping death had come.

   In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering
   mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come. Death was
   indeed there. The ground under one of the squatter's villages had caved
   in after a lightning stroke, destroying several of the malodorous
   shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic
   devastation which paled it to insignificance. Of a possible
   seventy-five natives who had inhabited this spot, not one living
   specimen was visible. The disordered earth was covered with blood and
   human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of demon teeth and
   talons; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage. That some
   hideous animal must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed; nor did any
   tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the
   sordid murders common in decadent communities. That charge was revived
   only when about twenty-five of the estimated population were found
   missing from the dead; and even then it was hard to explain the murder
   of fifty by half that number. But the fact remained that on a summer
   night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose
   corpses were horribly mangled, chewed, and clawed.

   The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the
   haunted Martense mansion, though the localities were over three miles
   apart. The troopers were more skeptical; including the mansion only
   casually in their investigations, and dropping it altogether when they
   found it thoroughly deserted. Country and village people, however,
   canvassed the place with infinite care; overturning everything in the
   house, sounding ponds and brooks, beating down bushes, and ransacking
   the nearby forests. All was in vain; the death that had come had left
   no trace save destruction itself.

   By the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the
   newspapers, whose reporters overran Tempest Mountain. They described it
   in much detail, and with many interviews to elucidate the horror's
   history as told by local grandams. I followed the accounts languidly at
   first, for I am a connoisseur in horrors; but after a week I detected
   an atmosphere which stirred me oddly, so that on August 5th, 1921, I
   registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at Lefferts
   Corners, nearest village to Tempest Mountain and acknowledged
   headquarters of the searchers. Three weeks more, and the dispersal of
   the reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the
   minute inquiries and surveying with which I had meanwhile busied
   myself.

   So on this summer night, while distant thunder rumbled, I left a silent
   motor-car and tramped with two armed companions up the last
   mound-covered reaches of Tempest Mountain, casting the beams of an
   electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through
   giant oaks ahead. In this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting
   illumination, the vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror
   which day could not uncover; yet I did not hesitate, since I had come
   with fierce resolution to test an idea. I believed that the thunder
   called the death-demon out of some fearsome secret place; and be that
   demon solid entity or vaporous pestilence, I meant to see it.

   I had thoroughly searched the ruin before, hence knew my plan well;
   choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of Jan Martense, whose
   murder looms so great in the rural legends. I felt subtly that the
   apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes. The chamber,
   measuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some
   rubbish which had once been furniture. It lay on the second story, on
   the southeast corner of the house, and had an immense east window and
   narrow south window, both devoid of panes or shutters. Opposite the
   large window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles
   representing the prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a
   spacious bed built into the wall.

   As the tree-muffled thunder grew louder, I arranged my plan's details.
   First I fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three
   rope ladders which I had brought with me. I knew they reached a
   suitable spot on the grass outside, for I had tested them. Then the
   three of us dragged from another room a wide four-poster bedstead,
   crowding it laterally against the window. Having strewn it with fir
   boughs, all now rested on it with drawn automatics, two relaxing while
   the third watched. From whatever direction the demon might come, our
   potential escape was provided. If it came from within the house, we had
   the window ladders; if from outside the door and the stairs. We did not
   think, judging from precedent, that it would pursue us far even at
   worst.

   I watched from midnight to one o'clock, when in spite of the sinister
   house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and
   lightning, I felt singularly drowsy. I was between my two companions,
   George Bennett being toward the window and William Tobey toward the
   fireplace. Bennett was asleep, having apparently felt the same
   anomalous drowsiness which affected me, so I designated Tobey for the
   next watch although even he was nodding. It is curious how intently I
   had been watching the fireplace.

   The increasing thunder must have affected my dreams, for in the brief
   time I slept there came to me apocalyptic visions. Once I partly
   awaked, probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly
   flung an arm across my chest. I was not sufficiently awake to see
   whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a
   distinct anxiety on that score. Never before had the presence of evil
   so poignantly oppressed me. Later I must have dropped asleep again, for
   it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night
   grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or
   imagination.

   In that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed
   hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion. I awoke to red
   madness and the mockery of diabolism, as farther and farther down
   inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and
   reverberated. There was no light, but I knew from the empty space at my
   right that Tobey was gone, God alone knew whither. Across my chest
   still lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left.

   Then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole
   mountain, lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove, and splintered the
   patriarch of the twisted trees. In the demon flash of a monstrous
   fireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond
   the window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the
   fireplace from which my eyes had never strayed. That I am still alive
   and sane, is a marvel I cannot fathom. I cannot fathom it, for the
   shadow on that chimney was not that of George Bennett or of any other
   human creature, but a blasphemous abnormality from hell's nethermost
   craters; a nameless, shapeless abomination which no mind could fully
   grasp and no pen even partly describe. In another second I was alone in
   the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering. George Bennett and
   William Tobey had left no trace, not even of a struggle. They were
   never heard of again.

II. A Passer In The Storm[edit]

   For days after that hideous experience in the forest-swathed mansion I
   lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at Lefferts Corners. I do not
   remember exactly how I managed to reach the motor-car, start it, and
   slip unobserved back to the village; for I retain no distinct
   impression save of wild-armed titan trees, demoniac mutterings of
   thunder, and Charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and
   streaked the region.

   As I shivered and brooded on the casting of that brain-blasting shadow,
   I knew that I had at last pried out one of earth's supreme horrors -
   one of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon
   scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space, yet from
   which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity. The
   shadow I had seen, I hardly dared to analyse or identify. Something had
   lain between me and the window that night, but I shuddered whenever I
   could not cast off the instinct to classify it. If it had only snarled,
   or bayed, or laughed titteringly-even that would have relieved the
   abysmal hideousness. But it was so silent. It had rested a heavy arm or
   foreleg on my chest...

   Obviously it was organic, or had once been organic... Jan Martense,
   whose room I had invaded, was buried in the grave-yard near the
   mansion... I must find Bennett and Tobey, if they lived... why had it
   picked them, and left me for the last?... Drowsiness is so stifling,
   and dreams are so horrible...

   In a short time I realised that I must tell my story to someone or
   break down completely. I had already decided not to abandon the quest
   for the lurking fear, for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that
   uncertainty was worse than enlightenment, however terrible the latter
   might prove to be. Accordingly I resolved in my mind the best course to
   pursue; whom to select for my confidences, and how to track down the
   thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow.

   My chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable
   reporters, of whom several had still remained to collect final echoes
   of the tragedy. It was from these that I determined to choose a
   colleague, and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined
   toward one Arthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose
   education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him
   as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences.

   On an afternoon in early September, Arthur Munroe listened to my story.
   I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic,
   and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the
   greatest shrewdness and judgement. His advice, moreover, was eminently
   practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the
   Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed
   historical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the
   countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and
   discovered a man who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral
   diary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as
   had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and slope
   again scanned for dens and caves, but all without result. And yet, as I
   have said, vague new fears hovered menacingly over us; as if giant
   bat-winged gryphons looked on transcosmic gulfs.

   As the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and
   we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain.
   This sound in such a locality naturally stirred us, though less than it
   would have done at night. As it was, we hoped desperately that the
   storm would last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from
   our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to
   gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation. Timid as
   they were, a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our
   protective leadership to promise such help.

   We had hardly more than turned, however, when there descended such a
   blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative. The
   extreme, almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble
   badly, but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our
   minute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin
   of the lot; an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still
   existing door and single tiny window both faced Maple Hill. Barring the
   door after us against the fury of the wind and rain, we put in place
   the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught us
   where to find. It was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the
   pitchy darkness, but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our
   pocket lamps about. Now and then we could see the lightning through
   cracks in the wall; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each
   flash was extremely vivid.

   The stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on
   Tempest Mountain. My mind turned to that odd question which had kept
   recurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened; and again I
   wondered why the demon, approaching the three watchers either from the
   window or the interior, had begun with the men on each side and left
   the middle man till the last, when the titan fireball had scared it
   away. Why had it not taken its victims in natural order, with myself
   second, from whichever direction it had approached? With what manner of
   far-reaching tentacles did it prey? Or did it know that I was the
   leader, and saved me for a fate worse than that of my companions?

   In the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to
   intensify them, there fell nearby a terrific bolt of lightning followed
   by the sound of sliding earth. At the same time the wolfish wind rose
   to demoniac crescendos of ululation. We were sure that the one tree on
   Maple Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from his box and went
   to the tiny window to ascertain the damage. When he took down the
   shutter the wind, and rain howled deafeningly in, so that I could not
   hear what he said; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom
   Nature's pandemonium.

   Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness
   told of the storm's passing. I had hoped it would last into the night
   to help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me
   removed the likelihood of such a thing. Suggesting to Munroe that we
   had better get some light even if more showers came, I unbarred and
   opened the crude door. The ground outside was a singular mass of mud
   and pools, with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but I
   saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently
   leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his
   shoulder; but he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and
   turned him around, I felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror
   whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the
   night that broods beyond time.

   For Arthur Munroe was dead. And on what remained of his chewed and
   gouged head there was no longer a face.

III. What The Red Glare Meant[edit]

   On the tempest-racked night of November 8, 1921, with a lantern which
   cast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the
   grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a
   thunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had
   burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad.

   I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th;
   the demon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment,
   and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After
   that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not
   understand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let them
   think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found
   nothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten
   them more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion
   had done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for
   a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest
   which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and
   solitary.

   The scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any
   ordinary man. Baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and
   grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish Druidic
   temple; muffling the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting
   but little rain. Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined
   by faint flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of
   the deserted mansion, while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch
   garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white, fungous, foetid,
   over-nourished vegetation that never saw full daylight. And nearest of
   all was the graveyard, where deformed trees tossed insane branches as
   their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay
   below. Now and then, beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and
   festered in the antediluvian forest darkness, I could trace the
   sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterized the
   lightning-pierced region.

   History had led me to this archaic grave. History, indeed, was all I
   had after everything else ended in mocking Satanism. I now believed
   that the lurking fear was no material being, but a wolf-fanged ghost
   that rode the midnight lightning. And I believed, because of the masses
   of local tradition I had unearthed in search with Arthur Munroe, that
   the ghost was that of Jan Martense, who died in 1762. This is why I was
   digging idiotically in his grave.

   The Martense mansion was built in 1670 by Gerrit Martense, a wealthy
   New-Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British
   rule, and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote
   woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased
   him. The only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was
   that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer.
   When selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had
   laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year;
   but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to
   such phenomena. At length, having found these storms injurious to his
   head, he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their
   wildest pandemonium.

   Of Gerrit Martense's descendants less is known than of himself; since
   they were all reared in hatred of the English civilisation, and trained
   to shun such of the colonists as accepted it. Their life was
   exceedingly secluded, and people declared that their isolation had made
   them heavy of speech and comprehension. In appearance all were marked
   by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue
   and the other brown. Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer, till
   at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about
   the estate. Many of the crowded family degenerated, moved across the
   valley, and merged with the mongrel population which was later to
   produce the pitiful squatters. The rest had stuck sullenly to their
   ancestral mansion, becoming more and more clannish and taciturn, yet
   developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms.

   Most of this information reached the outside world through young Jan
   Martense, who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army
   when news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain. He was the
   first of Gerrit's descendants to see much of the world; and when he
   returned in 1760 after six years of campaigning, he was hated as an
   outsider by his father, uncles, and brothers, in spite of his
   dissimilar Martense eyes. No longer could he share the peculiarities
   and prejudices of the Martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms
   failed to intoxicate him as they had before. Instead, his surroundings
   depressed him; and he frequently wrote to a friend in Albany of plans
   to leave the paternal roof.

   In the spring of 1763 Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan
   Martense, became worried by his correspondent's silence; especially in
   view of the conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion. Determined
   to visit Jan in person, he went into the mountains on horseback. His
   diary states that he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20, finding
   the mansion in great decrepitude. The sullen, odd-eyed Martenses, whose
   unclean animal aspect shocked him, told him in broken gutterals that
   Jan was dead. He had, they insisted, been struck by lightning the
   autumn before; and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens.
   They showed the visitor the grave, barren and devoid of markers.
   Something in the Martenses' manner gave Gifford a feeling of repulsion
   and suspicion, and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to
   explore the sepulchral spot. He found what he expected - a skull
   crushed cruelly as if by savage blows - so returning to Albany he
   openly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman.

   Legal evidence was lacking, but the story spread rapidly round the
   countryside; and from that time the Martenses were ostracised by the
   world. No one would deal with them, and their distant manor was shunned
   as an accursed place. Somehow they managed to live on independently by
   the product of their estate, for occasional lights glimpsed from
   far-away hills attested their continued presence. These lights were
   seen as late as 1810, but toward the last they became very infrequent.

   Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of
   diabolic legendry. The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness,
   and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply. It
   remained unvisited till 1816, when the continued absence of lights was
   noticed by the squatters. At that time a party made investigations,
   finding the house deserted and partly in ruins.

   There were no skeletons about, so that departure rather than death was
   inferred. The clan seemed to have left several years before, and
   improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to its
   migration. Its cultural level had fallen very low, as proved by
   decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long
   abandoned when its owners left. But though the dreaded Martenses were
   gone, the fear of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute when
   new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents. There it
   stood; deserted, feared, and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan
   Martense. There it still stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense's
   grave.

   I have described my protracted digging as idiotic, and such it indeed
   was in object and method. The coffin of Jan Martense had soon been
   unearthed-it now held only dust and nitre - but in my fury to exhume
   his ghost I delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had
   lain. God knows what I expected to find-I only felt that I was digging
   in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night.

   It is impossible to say what monstrous depth I had attained when my
   spade, and soon my feet, broke through the ground beneath. The event,
   under the circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a
   subterranean space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation. My
   slight fall had extinguished the lantern, but I produced an electric
   pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away
   indefinitely in both directions. It was amply large enough for a man to
   wriggle through; and though no sane person would have tried at that
   time, I forgot danger, reason, and cleanliness in my single-minded
   fever to unearth the lurking fear. Choosing the direction toward the
   house, I scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow; squirming ahead
   blindly and rapidly, and flashing but seldom the lamp I kept before me.

   What language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely
   abysmal earth; pawing, twisting, wheezing; scrambling madly through
   sunken -convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time,
   safety, direction, or definite object? There is something hideous in
   it, but that is what I did. I did it for so long that life faded to a
   far memory, and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted
   depths. Indeed, it was only by accident that after interminable
   writhings I jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight, so that it shone
   eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead.

   I had been scrambling in this way for some time, so that my battery had
   burned very low, when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward,
   altering my mode of progress. And as I raised my glance it was without
   preparation that I saw glistening in the distance two demoniac
   reflections of my expiring lamp; two reflections glowing with a baneful
   and unmistakable effulgence, and provoking maddeningly nebulous
   memories. I stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat.
   The eyes approached, yet of the thing that bore them I could
   distinguish only a claw. But what a claw! Then far overhead I heard a
   faint crashing which I recognized. It was the wild thunder of the
   mountain, raised to hysteric fury - I must have been crawling upward
   for some time, so that the surface was now quite near. And as the
   muffled thunder clattered, those eyes still stared with vacuous
   viciousness.

   Thank God I did not then know what it was, else I should have died. But
   I was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it, for after a
   hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those
   frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and
   there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes.
   With Cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit,
   blinding and deafening me, yet not wholly reducing me to a coma. In the
   chaos of sliding, shifting earth I clawed and floundered helplessly
   till the rain on my head steadied me and I saw that I had come to the
   surface in a familiar spot; a steep unforested place on the southwest
   slope of the mountain. Recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled
   ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched
   down from the wooded higher slope, but there was nothing in the chaos
   to show my place of egress from the lethal catacomb. My brain was as
   great a chaos as the earth, and as a distant red glare burst on the
   landscape from the south I hardly realised the horror I had been
   through.

   But when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant,
   I felt more horror than that which the mould-burrow and the claw and
   eyes had given; more horror because of the overwhelming implications.
   In a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt
   which brought me above ground, and a nameless thing had dropped from an
   overhanging tree into a weak-roofed cabin. It had done a deed, but the
   squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape. It had
   been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing
   with the claw and eyes.

IV. The Horror In The Eyes[edit]

   There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew
   of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear that
   lurked there. That at least two of the fear's embodiments were
   destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety
   in this Acheron of multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with
   even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous.
   When, two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes
   and claw, I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away
   at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me, I experienced virtual
   convulsions of fright. But that fright was so mixed with wonder and
   alluring grotesqueness, that it was almost a pleasant sensation.
   Sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one
   over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of Nis,
   it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself
   voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream-doom into whatever
   bottomless gulf may yawn. And so it was with the walking nightmare of
   Tempest Mountain; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot
   gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the
   accursed region, and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from
   every inch of the poisonous soil.

   As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly
   where I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all
   trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much
   earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had
   dug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant
   hamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid
   for my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several
   bones, but apparently none of the monster's. The squatters said the
   thing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate,
   since besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another
   bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull
   at some time. Though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen, no
   one could say just what the creature was like; those who had glimpsed
   it called it simply a devil. Examining the great tree where it had
   lurked, I could discern no distinctive marks. I tried to find some
   trail into the black forest, but on this occasion could not stand the
   sight of those morbidly large boles, or of those vast serpent-like
   roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth.

   My next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet
   where death had come most abundantly, and where Arthur Munroe had seen
   something he never lived to describe. Though my vain previous searches
   had been exceedingly minute, I now had new data to test; for my
   horrible grave-crawl convinced me that at least one of the phases of
   the monstrosity had been an underground creature. This time, on the
   14th of November, my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of
   Cone Mountain and Maple Hill where they overlook the unfortunate
   hamlet, and I gave particular attention to the loose earth of the
   landslide region on the latter eminence.

   The afternoon of my search brought nothing to light, and dusk came as I
   stood on Maple Hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to
   Tempest Mountain. There had been a gorgeous sunset, and now the moon
   came up, nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain, the
   distant mountainside, and the curious low mounds that rose here and
   there. It was a peaceful Arcadian scene, but knowing what it hid I
   hated it. I hated the mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the
   festering mountain, and those sinister mounds. Everything seemed to me
   tainted with a loathsome contagion, and inspired by a noxious alliance
   with distorted hidden powers.

   Presently, as I gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama, my eye
   became attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of
   a certain topographical element. Without having any exact knowledge of
   geology, I had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and
   hummocks of the region. I had noticed that they were pretty widely
   distributed around Tempest Mountain, though less numerous on the plain
   than near the hilltop itself, where prehistoric glaciation had
   doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic
   caprices. Now, in the light of that low moon which cast long weird
   shadows, it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the
   mound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of Tempest Mountain.
   That summit was undeniably a centre from which the lines or rows of
   points radiated indefinitely and irregularly, as if the unwholesome
   Martense mansion had thrown visible tentacles of terror. The idea of
   such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill, and I stopped to analyse
   my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomena.

   The more I analysed the less I believed, and against my newly opened
   mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on
   superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth. Before I
   knew it I was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself; "My
   God!... Molehills... the damned place must be honeycombed... how
   many... that night at the mansion... they took Bennett and Tobey
   first... on each side of us..." Then I was digging frantically into the
   mound which had stretched nearest me; digging desperately, shiveringly,
   but almost jubilantly; digging and at last shrieking aloud with some
   unplaced emotion as I came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one
   through which I had crawled on the other demoniac night.

   After that I recall running, spade in hand; a hideous run across
   moon-litten, mound-marked meadows and through diseased, precipitous
   abysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping screaming, panting,
   bounding toward the terrible Martense mansion. I recall digging
   unreasonably in all parts of the brier-choked cellar; digging to find
   the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds. And then I
   recall how I laughed when I stumbled on the passageway; the hole at the
   base of the old chimney, where the thick weeds grew and cast queer
   shadows in the light of the lone candle I had happened to have with me.
   What still remained down in that hell-hive, lurking and waiting for the
   thunder to arouse it, I did not know. Two had been killed; perhaps that
   had finished it. But still there remained that burning determination to
   reach the innermost secret of the fear, which I had once more come to
   deem definite, material, and organic.

   My indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and
   immediately with my pocket-light or to try to assemble a band of
   squatters for the quest, was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush
   of wind from the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark
   blackness. The moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures
   above me, and with a sense of fateful alarm I heard the sinister and
   significant rumble of approaching thunder. A confusion of associated
   ideas possessed my brain, leading me to grope back toward the farthest
   corner of the cellar. My eyes, however, never turned away from the
   horrible opening at the base of the chimney; and I began to get
   glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of
   lightning penetrated the weeds outside and illumined the chinks in the
   upper wall. Every second I was consumed with a mixture of fear and
   curiosity. What would the storm call forth-or was there anything left
   for it to call? Guided by a lightning flash I settled myself down
   behind a dense clump of vegetation, through which I could see the
   opening without being seen.

   If heaven is merciful, it will some day efface from my consciousness
   the sight that I saw, and let me live my last years in peace. I cannot
   sleep at night now, and have to take opiates when it thunders. The
   thing came abruptly and unannounced; a demon, ratlike scurrying from
   pits remote and unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting,
   and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous
   and leprous life - a loathsome night-spawned flood of organic
   corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of
   mortal madness and morbidity. Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like
   serpents' slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole, spreading
   like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of
   egress - streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests
   and strew fear, madness, and death.

   God knows how many there were - there must have been thousands. To see
   the stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking.
   When they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms,
   I saw that they were dwarfed, deformed hairy devils or apes-monstrous
   and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe. They were so hideously
   silent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers
   turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed
   fashion on a weaker companion. 0thers snapped up what it left and ate
   with slavering relish. Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust,
   my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities
   oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my
   automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder.

   Shrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness
   chasing one another through endless, ensanguined condors of purple
   fulgurous sky... formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a
   ghoulish, remembered scene; forests of monstrous over-nourished oaks
   with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth
   verminous with millions of cannibal devils; mound-like tentacles
   groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion... insane
   lightning over malignant ivied walls and demon arcades choked with
   fungous vegetation... Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me
   unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that
   slept under the calm stars of clearing skies.

   I had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of men to
   blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest Mountain
   with dynamite, stop up all the discoverable mound-burrows, and destroy
   certain over-nourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to
   sanity. I could sleep a little after they had done this, but true rest
   will never come as long as I remember that nameless secret of the
   lurking fear. The thing will haunt me, for who can say the
   extermination is complete, and that analogous phenomena do not exist
   all over the world? Who can, with my knowledge, think of the earth's
   unknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities? I
   cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering... why cannot
   the doctors give me something to make me sleep, or truly calm my brain
   when it thunders?

   What I saw in the glow of flashlight after I shot the unspeakable
   straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before I
   understood and went delirious. The object was nauseous; a filthy
   whitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur. It was
   the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome
   of isolated spawning, multiplication, and cannibal nutrition above and
   below the ground; the embodiment of all the snarling and chaos and
   grinning fear that lurk behind life. It had looked at me as it died,
   and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes
   which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections.
   One eye was blue, the other brown. They were the dissimilar Martense
   eyes of the old legends, and I knew in one inundating cataclysm of
   voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family; the terrible
   and thunder-crazed house of Martense.

   The Man of Stone  (1932)
   by H. P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald
   1364034The Man of Stoneby H. P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald1932

   Ben Hayden was always a stubborn chap, and once he had heard about
   those strange statues in the upper Adirondacks, nothing could keep him
   from going to see them. I had been his closest acquaintance for years,
   and our Damon and Pythias friendship made us inseparable at all times.
   So when Ben firmly decided to go--well, I had to trot along too, like a
   faithful collie.

   "Jack," he said, "you know Henry Jackson, who was up in a shack beyond
   Lake Placid for that beastly spot in his lung? Well, he came back the
   other day nearly cured, but had a lot to say about some devilish queer
   conditions up there. He ran into the business all of a sudden and can't
   be sure yet that it's anything more than a case of bizarre sculpture;
   but just the same his uneasy impression sticks.

   "It seems he was out hunting one day, and came across a cave with what
   looked like a dog in front of it. Just as he was expecting the dog to
   bark he looked again, and saw that the thing wasn't alive at all. It
   was a stone dog--such a perfect image, down to the smallest whisker,
   that he couldn't decide whether it was a supernaturally clever statue
   or a petrified animal. He was almost afraid to touch it, but when he
   did he realised it was surely made of stone.

   "After a while he nerved himself up to go into the cave--and there he
   got a still bigger jolt. Only a little way in there was another stone
   figure--or what looked like it--but this time it was a man's. It lay on
   the floor, on its side, wore clothes, and had a peculiar smile on its
   face. This time Henry didn't stop to do any touching, but beat it
   straight for the village, Mountain Top, you know. Of course he asked
   questions--but they did not get him very far. He found he was on a
   ticklish subject, for the natives only shook their heads, crossed their
   fingers, and muttered something about a `Mad Dan'--whoever he was.

   "It was too much for Jackson, so he came home weeks ahead of his
   planned time. He told me all about it because he knows how fond I am of
   strange things--and oddly enough, I was able to fish up a recollection
   that dovetailed pretty neatly with his yarn. Do you remember Arthur
   Wheeler, the sculptor who was such a realist that people began calling
   him nothing but a solid photographer? I think you knew him slightly.
   Well, as a matter of fact, he ended up in that part of the Adirondacks
   himself. Spent a lot of time there, and then dropped out of sight.
   Never heard from again. Now if stone statues that look like men and
   dogs are turning up around there, it looks to me as if they might be
   his work--no matter what the rustics say, or refuse to say, about them.
   Of course a fellow with Jackson's nerves might easily get flighty and
   disturbed over things like that; but I'd have done a lot of examining
   before running away.

   "In fact, Jack, I'm going up there now to look things over--and you're
   coming along with me. It would mean a lot to find Wheeler--or any of
   his work. Anyhow, the mountain air will brace us both up."

   So less than a week later, after a long train ride and a jolting bus
   trip through breathlessly exquisite scenery, we arrived at Mountain Top
   in the late, golden sunlight of a June evening. The village comprised
   only a few small houses, a hotel, and the general store at which our
   bus drew up; but we knew that the latter would probably prove a focus
   for such information. Surely enough, the usual group of idlers was
   gathered around the steps; and when we represented ourselves as
   health-seekers in search of lodgings they had many recommendations to
   offer.

   Though we had not planned to do any investigating till the next day,
   Ben could not resist venturing some vague, cautious questions when he
   noticed the senile garrulousness of one of the ill-clad loafers. He
   felt, from Jackson's previous experience, that it would be useless to
   begin with references to the queer statues; but decided to mention
   Wheeler as one whom we had known, and in whose fate we consequently had
   a right to be interested.

   The crowd seemed uneasy when Sam stopped his whittling and started
   talking, but they had slight occasion for alarm. Even this barefoot old
   mountain decadent tightened up when he heard Wheeler's name, and only
   with difficulty could Ben get anything coherent out of him. "Wheeler?"
   he had finally wheezed. "Oh, yeh--that feller as was all the time
   blastin' rocks and cuttin' 'em up into statues. So yew knowed him, hey?
   Wal, they ain't much we kin tell ye, and mebbe that's too much. He
   stayed out to Mad Dan's cabin in the hills--but not so very long. Got
   so he wa'nt wanted no more . . . by Dan, that is. Kinder soft-spoken
   and got around Dan's wife till the old devil took notice. Pretty sweet
   on her, I guess. But he took the trail sudden, and nobody's seen hide
   nor hair of him since. Dan must a told him sumthin' pretty plain--bad
   feller to get agin ye, Dan is! Better keep away from thar, boys, for
   they ain't no good in that part of the hills. Dan's ben workin' up a
   worse and worse mood, and ain't seen about no more. Nor his wife,
   neither. Guess he's penned her up so's nobody else kin make eyes at
   her!"

   As Sam resumed his whittling after a few more observations, Ben and I
   exchanged glances. Here, surely, was a new lead which deserved
   intensive following up. Deciding to lodge at the hotel, we settled
   ourselves as quickly as possible; planning for a plunge into the wild
   hilly country on the next day.

   At sunrise we made our start, each bearing a knapsack laden with
   provisions and such tools as we thought we might need. The day before
   us had an almost stimulating air of invitation--through which only a
   faint undercurrent of the sinister ran. Our rough mountain road quickly
   became steep and winding, so that before long our feet ached
   considerably.

   After about two miles we left the road--crossing a stone wall on our
   right near a great elm and striking off diagonally toward a steeper
   slope according to the chart and directions which Jackson had prepared
   for us. It was rough and briery travelling, but we knew that the cave
   could not be far off. In the end we came upon the aperture quite
   suddenly--a black, bush-grown crevice where the ground shot abruptly
   upward, and beside it, near a shallow rock pool, a small, still figure
   stood rigid--as if rivalling its own uncanny petrification.

   It was a grey dog--or a dog's statue--and as our simultaneous gasp died
   away we scarcely knew what to think. Jackson had exaggerated nothing,
   and we could not believe that any sculptor's hand had succeeded in
   producing such perfection. Every hair of the animal's magnificent coat
   seemed distinct, and those on the back were bristled up as if some
   unknown thing had taken him unaware. Ben, at last half-kindly touching
   the delicate stony fur, gave vent to an exclamation.

   "Good God, Jack, but this can't be any statue! Look at it--all the
   little details, and the way the hair lies! None of Wheeler's technique
   here! This is a real dog--though heaven only knows how he ever got in
   this state. Just like stone--feel for yourself. Do you suppose there's
   any strange gas that sometimes comes out of the cave and does this to
   animal life? We ought to have looked more into the local legends. And
   if this is a real dog--or was a real dog--then that man inside must be
   the real thing too."

   It was with a good deal of genuine solemnity--almost dread--that we
   finally crawled on hands and knees through the cave-mouth, Ben leading.
   The narrowness looked hardly three feet, after which the grotto
   expanded in every direction to form a damp, twilight chamber floored
   with rubble and detritus. For a time we could make out very little, but
   as we rose to our feet and strained our eyes we began slowly to descry
   a recumbent figure amidst the greater darkness ahead. Ben fumbled with
   his flashlight, but hesitated for a moment before turning it on the
   prostrate figure. We had little doubt that the stony thing was what had
   once been a man, and something in the thought unnerved us both.

   When Ben at last sent forth the electric beam we saw that the object
   lay on its side, back toward us. It was clearly of the same material as
   the dog outside, but was dressed in the mouldering and unpetrified
   remains of rough sport clothing. Braced as we were for a shock, we
   approached quite calmly to examine the thing; Ben going around to the
   other side to glimpse the averted face. Neither could possibly have
   been prepared for what Ben saw when he flashed the light on those stony
   features. His cry was wholly excusable, and I could not help echoing it
   as I leaped to his side and shared the sight. Yet it was nothing
   hideous or intrinsically terrifying. It was merely a matter of
   recognition, for beyond the least shadow of a doubt this chilly rock
   figure with its half-frightened, half-bitter expression had at one time
   been our old acquaintance, Arthur Wheeler.

   Some instinct sent us staggering and crawling out of the cave, and down
   the tangled slope to a point whence we could not see the ominous stone
   dog. We hardly knew what to think, for our brains were churning with
   conjectures and apprehensions. Ben, who had known Wheeler well, was
   especially upset; and seemed to be piecing together some threads I had
   overlooked.

   Again and again as we paused on the green slope he repeated "Poor
   Arthur, poor Arthur!" but not till he muttered the name "Mad Dan" did I
   recall the trouble into which, according to old Sam Poole, Wheeler had
   run just before his disappearance. Mad Dan, Ben implied, would
   doubtless be glad to see what had happened. For a moment it flashed
   over both of us that the jealous host might have been responsible for
   the sculptor's presence in this evil cave, but the thought went as
   quickly as it came.

   The thing that puzzled us most was to account for the phenomenon
   itself. What gaseous emanation or mineral vapour could have wrought
   this change in so relatively short a time was utterly beyond us. Normal
   petrification, we know, is a slow chemical replacement process
   requiring vast ages for completion; yet here were two stone images
   which had been living things--or at least Wheeler had--only a few weeks
   before. Conjecture was useless. Clearly, nothing remained but to notify
   the authorities and let them guess what they might; and yet at the back
   of Ben's head that notion about Mad Dan still persisted. Anyhow, we
   clawed our way back to the road, but Ben did not turn toward the
   village, but looked along upward toward where old Sam had said Dan's
   cabin lay. It was the second house from the village, the ancient loafer
   had wheezed, and lay on the left far back from the road in a thick
   copse of scrub oaks. Before I knew it Ben was dragging me up the sandy
   highway past a dingy farmstead and into a region of increasing
   wildness.

   It did not occur to me to protest, but I felt a certain sense of
   mounting menace as the familiar marks of agriculture and civilisation
   grew fewer and fewer. At last the beginning of a narrow, neglected path
   opened up on our left, while the peaked roof of a squalid, unpainted
   building shewed itself beyond a sickly growth of half-dead trees. This,
   I knew, must be Mad Dan's cabin; and I wondered that Wheeler had ever
   chosen so unprepossessing a place for his headquarters. I dreaded to
   walk up that weedy, uninviting path, but could not lag behind when Ben
   strode determinedly along and began a vigorous rapping at the rickety,
   musty-smelling door.

   There was no response to the knock, and something in its echoes sent a
   series of shivers through one. Ben, however, was quite unperturbed; and
   at once began to circle the house in quest of unlocked windows. The
   third that he tried--in the rear of the dismal cabin--proved capable of
   opening, and after a boost and a vigorous spring he was safely inside
   and helping me after him.

   The room in which we landed was full of limestone and granite blocks,
   chiselling tools and clay models, and we realised at once that it was
   Wheeler's erstwhile studio. So far we had not met with any sign of
   life, but over everything hovered a damnably ominous dusty odour. On
   our left was an open door evidently leading to a kitchen on the chimney
   side of the house, and through this Ben started, intent on finding
   anything he could concerning his friend's last habitat. He was
   considerably ahead of me when he crossed the threshold, so that I could
   not see at first what brought him up short and wrung a low cry of
   horror from his lips.

   In another moment, though, I did see--and repeated his cry as
   instinctively as I had done in the cave. For here in this cabin--far
   from any subterranean depths which could breed strange gases and work
   strange mutations--were two stony figures which I knew at once were no
   products of Arthur Wheeler's chisel. In a rude armchair before the
   fireplace, bound in position by the lash of a long rawhide whip, was
   the form of a man--unkempt, elderly, and with a look of fathomless
   horror on its evil, petrified face.

   On the floor beside it lay a woman's figure; graceful, and with a face
   betokening considerable youth and beauty. Its expression seemed to be
   one of sardonic satisfaction, and near its outflung right hand was a
   large tin pail, somewhat stained on the inside, as with a darkish
   sediment.

   We made no move to approach those inexplicably petrified bodies, nor
   did we exchange any but the simplest conjectures. That this stony
   couple had been Mad Dan and his wife we could not well doubt, but how
   to account for their present condition was another matter. As we looked
   horrifiedly around we saw the suddenness with which the final
   development must have come--for everything about us seemed, despite a
   heavy coating of dust, to have been left in the midst of commonplace
   household activities.

   The only exception to this rule of casualness was on the kitchen table;
   in whose cleared centre, as if to attract attention, lay a thin,
   battered, blank-book weighted down by a sizeable tin funnel. Crossing
   to read the thing, Ben saw that it was a kind of diary or set of dated
   entries, written in a somewhat cramped and none too practiced hand. The
   very first words riveted my attention, and before ten seconds had
   elapsed he was breathlessly devouring the halting text--I avidly
   following as I peered over his shoulder. As we read on--moving as we
   did so into the less loathsome atmosphere of the adjoining room--many
   obscure things became terribly clear to us, and we trembled with a
   mixture of complex emotions.

   This is what we read--and what the coroner read later on. The public
   has seen a highly twisted and sensationalised version in the cheap
   newspapers, but not even that has more than a fraction of the genuine
   terror which the simple original held for us as we puzzled it out alone
   in that musty cabin among the wild hills, with two monstrous stone
   abnormalities lurking in the death-like silence of the next room. When
   we had finished Ben pocketed the book with a gesture half of repulsion,
   and his first words were "Let's get out of here." Silently and
   nervously we stumbled to the front of the house, unlocked the door, and
   began the long tramp back to the village. There were many statements to
   make and questions to answer in the days that followed, and I do not
   think that either Ben or I can ever shake off the effects of the whole
   harrowing experience. Neither can some of the local authorities and
   city reporters who flocked around--even though they burned a certain
   book and many papers found in attic boxes, and destroyed considerable
   apparatus in the deepest part of that sinister hillside cave. But here
   is the text itself:

   "Nov. 5--My name is Daniel Morris. Around here they call me `Mad Dan'
   because I believe in powers that nobody else believes in nowadays. When
   I go up on Thunder Hill to keep the Feast of the Foxes they think I am
   crazy--all except the back country folks that are afraid of me. They
   try to stop me from sacrificing the Black Goat at Hallow Eve, and
   always prevent my doing the Great Rite that would open the gate. They
   ought to know better, for they know I am a Van Kauran on my mother's
   side, and anybody this side of the Hudson can tell what the Van Kaurans
   have handed down. We come from Nicholas Van Kauran, the wizard, who was
   hanged in Wijtgaart in 1587, and everybody knows he had made the
   bargain with the Black Man.

   "The soldiers never got his Book of Eibon when they burned his house,
   and his grandson, William Van Kauran, brought it over when he came to
   Rensselaerwyck and later crossed the river to Esopus. Ask anybody in
   Kingston or Hurley about what the William Van Kauran line could do to
   people that got in their way. Also, ask them if my Uncle Hendrik didn't
   manage to keep hold of the Book of Eibon when they ran him out of town
   and he went up the river to this place with his family.

   "I am writing this--and am going to keep writing this--because I want
   people to know the truth after I am gone. Also, I am afraid I shall
   really go mad if I don't set things down in plain black and white.
   Everything is going against me, and if it keeps up I shall have to use
   the secrets in the Book and call in certain Powers. Three months ago
   that sculptor Arthur Wheeler came to Mountain Top, and they sent him up
   to me because I am the only man in the place who knows anything except
   farming, hunting, and fleecing summer boarders. The fellow seemed to be
   interested in what I had to say, and made a deal to stop here for
   $13.00 a week with meals. I gave him the back room beside the kitchen
   for his lumps of stone and his chiselling, and arranged with Nate
   Williams to tend to his rock blasting and haul his big pieces with a
   drag and yoke of oxen.

   "That was three months ago. Now I know why that cursed son of hell took
   so quick to the place. It wasn't my talk at all, but the looks of my
   wife Rose, that is Osborne Chandler's oldest girl. She is sixteen years
   younger than I am, and is always casting sheep's eyes at the fellows in
   town. But we always managed to get along fine enough till this dirty
   rat shewed up, even if she did balk at helping me with the Rites on
   Roodmas and Hallowmass. I can see now that Wheeler is working on her
   feelings and getting her so fond of him that she hardly looks at me,
   and I suppose he'll try to elope with her sooner or later.

   "But he works slow like all sly, polished dogs, and I've got plenty of
   time to think up what to do about it. They don't either of them know I
   suspect anything, but before long they'll both realise it doesn't pay
   to break up a Van Kauran's home. I promise them plenty of novelty in
   what I'll do.

   "Nov. 25--Thanksgiving Day! That's a pretty good joke! But at that I'll
   have something to be thankful for when I finish what I've started. No
   question but that Wheeler is trying to steal my wife. For the time
   being, though, I'll let him keep on being a star boarder. Got the Book
   of Eibon down from Uncle Hendrik's old trunk in the attic last week,
   and am looking up something good which won't require sacrifices that I
   can't make around here. I want something that'll finish these two
   sneaking traitors, and at the same time get me into no trouble. If it
   has a twist of drama in it, so much the better. I've thought of calling
   in the emanation of Yoth, but that needs a child's blood and I must be
   careful about the neighbours. The Green Decay looks promising, but that
   would be a bit unpleasant for me as well as for them. I don't like
   certain sights and smells.

   "Dec. 10--Eureka! I've got the very thing at last! Revenge is
   sweet--and this is the perfect climax! Wheeler, the sculptor--this is
   too good! Yes, indeed, that damned sneak is going to produce a statue
   that will sell quicker than any of the things he's been carving these
   past weeks! A realist, eh? Well--the new statuary won't lack any
   realism! I found the formula in a manuscript insert opposite page 679
   of the Book. From the handwriting I judge it was put there by my
   great-grandfather Bareut Picterse Van Kauran--the one who disappeared
   from New Paltz in 1839. I?! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand
   Young!

   "To be plain, I've found a way to turn those wretched rats into stone
   statues. It's absurdly simple, and really depends more on plain
   chemistry than on the Outer Powers. If I can get hold of the right
   stuff I can brew a drink that'll pass for home-made wine, and one swig
   ought to finish any ordinary being short of an elephant. What it
   amounts to is a kind of petrification infinitely speeded up. Shoots the
   whole system full of calcium and barium salts and replaces living cells
   with mineral matter so fast that nothing can stop it. It must have been
   one of those things great-grandfather got at the Great Sabbat on
   Sugar-Loaf in the Catskills. Queer things used to go on there. Seems to
   me I heard of a man in New Paltz--Squire Hasbrouck--turned to stone or
   something like that in 1834. He was an enemy of the Van Kaurans. First
   thing I must do is order the five chemicals I need from Albany and
   Montreal. Plenty of time later to experiment. When everything is over
   I'll round up all the statues and sell them as Wheeler's work to pay
   for his overdue board bill! He always was a realist and an
   egoist--wouldn't it be natural for him to make a self-portrait in
   stone, and to use my wife for another model--as indeed he's really been
   doing for the past fortnight? Trust the dull public not to ask what
   quarry the queer stone came from!

   "Dec. 25--Christmas. Peace on earth, and so forth! These two swine are
   goggling at each other as if I didn't exist. They must think I'm deaf,
   dumb, and blind! Well, the barium sulphate and calcium chloride came
   from Albany last Thursday, and the acids, catalytics, and instruments
   are due from Montreal any day now. The mills of the gods--and all that!
   I'll do the work in Allen's Cave near the lower wood lot, and at the
   same time will be openly making some wine in the cellar here. There
   ought to be some excuse for offering a new drink--though it won't take
   much planning to fool those moonstruck nincompoops. The trouble will be
   to make Rose take wine, for she pretends not to like it. Any
   experiments that I make on animals will be down at the cave, and nobody
   ever thinks of going there in winter. I'll do some wood-cutting to
   account for my time away. A small load or two brought in will keep him
   off the track.

   "Jan. 20--It's harder work than I thought. A lot depends on the exact
   proportions. The stuff came from Montreal, but I had to send again for
   some better scales and an acetylene lamp. They're getting curious down
   at the village. Wish the express office weren't in Steenwyck's store.
   Am trying various mixtures on the sparrows that drink and bathe in the
   pool in front of the cave--when it's melted. Sometimes it kills them,
   but sometimes they fly away. Clearly, I've missed some important
   reaction. I suppose Rose and that upstart are making the most of my
   absence--but I can afford to let them. There can be no doubt of my
   success in the end.

   "Feb. 11--Have got it at last! Put a fresh lot in the little
   pool--which is well melted today--and the first bird that drank toppled
   over as if he were shot. I picked him up a second later, and he was a
   perfect piece of stone, down to the smallest claws and feather. Not a
   muscle changed since he was poised for drinking, so he must have died
   the instant any of the stuff got to his stomach. I didn't expect the
   petrification to come so soon. But a sparrow isn't a fair test of the
   way the thing would act with a large animal. I must get something
   bigger to try it on, for it must be the right strength when I give it
   to those swine. I guess Rose's dog Rex will do. I'll take him along the
   next time and say a timber wolf got him. She thinks a lot of him, and I
   shan't be sorry to give her something to sniffle over before the big
   reckoning. I must be careful where I keep this book. Rose sometimes
   pries around in the queerest places.

   "Feb. 15--Getting warm! Tried it on Rex and it worked like a charm with
   only double the strength. I fixed the rock pool and got him to drink.
   He seemed to know something queer had hit him, for he bristled and
   growled, but he was a piece of stone before he could turn his head. The
   solution ought to have been stronger, and for a human being ought to be
   very much stronger. I think I'm getting the hang of it now, and am
   about ready for that cur Wheeler. The stuff seems to be tasteless, but
   to make sure I'll flavour it with the new wine I'm making up at the
   house. Wish I were surer about the tastelessness, so I could give it to
   Rose in water without trying to urge wine on her. I'll get the two
   separately--Wheeler out here and Rose at home. Have just fixed a strong
   solution and cleared away all strange objects in front of the cave.
   Rose whimpered like a puppy when I told her a wolf had got Rex, and
   Wheeler gurgled a lot of sympathy. "March 1--I? R'lyeh! Praise the Lord
   Tsathoggua! I've got the son of hell at last! Told him I'd found a new
   ledge of friable limestone down this way, and he trotted after me like
   the yellow cur he is! I had the wine-flavoured stuff in a bottle on my
   hip, and he was glad of a swig when we got here. Gulped it down without
   a wink--and dropped in his tracks before you could count three. But he
   knows I've had my vengeance, for I made a face at him that he couldn't
   miss. I saw the look of understanding come into his face as he keeled
   over. In two minutes he was solid stone.

   "I dragged him into the cave and put Rex's figure outside again. That
   bristling dog shape will help to scare people off. It's getting time
   for the spring hunters, and besides, there's a damned `lunger' named
   Jackson in a cabin over the hill who does a lot of snooping around in
   the snow. I wouldn't want my laboratory and storeroom to be found just
   yet! When I got home I told Rose that Wheeler had found a telegram at
   the village summoning him suddenly home. I don't know whether she
   believed me or not but it doesn't matter. For form's sake, I packed
   Wheeler's things and took them down the hill, telling her I was going
   to ship them after him. I put them in the dry well at the abandoned
   Rapelye place. Now for Rose!

   "March 3--Can't get Rose to drink any wine. I hope that stuff is
   tasteless enough to go unnoticed in water. I tried it in tea and
   coffee, but it forms a precipitate and can't be used that way. If I use
   it in water I'll have to cut down the dose and trust to a more gradual
   action. Mr. and Mrs. Hoog dropped in this noon, and I had hard work
   keeping the conversation away from Wheeler's departure. It mustn't get
   around that we say he was called back to New York when everybody at the
   village knows no telegram came, and that he didn't leave on the bus.
   Rose is acting damned queer about the whole thing. I'll have to pick a
   quarrel with her and keep her locked in the attic. The best way is to
   try to make her drink that doctored wine--and if she does give in, so
   much better.

   "March 7--Have started in on Rose. She wouldn't drink the wine so I
   took a whip to her and drove her up in the attic. She'll never come
   down alive. I pass her a platter of salty bread and salt meat, and a
   pail of slightly doctored water, twice a day. The salt food ought to
   make her drink a lot, and it can't be long before the action sets in. I
   don't like the way she shouts about Wheeler when I'm at the door. The
   rest of the time she is absolutely silent.

   "March 9--It's damned peculiar how slow that stuff is in getting hold
   of Rose. I'll have to make it stronger--probably she'll never taste it
   with all the salt I've been feeding her. Well, if it doesn't get her
   there are plenty of other ways to fall back on. But I would like to
   carry this neat statue plan through! Went to the cave this morning and
   all is well there. I sometimes hear Rose's steps on the ceiling
   overhead, and I think they're getting more and more dragging. The stuff
   is certainly working, but it's too slow. Not strong enough. From now on
   I'll rapidly stiffen up the dose.

   "March 11--It is very queer. She is still alive and moving. Tuesday
   night I heard her piggling with a window, so went up and gave her a
   rawhiding. She acts more sullen than frightened, and her eyes look
   swollen. But she could never drop to the ground from that height and
   there's nowhere she could climb down. I have had dreams at night, for
   her slow, dragging pacing on the floor above gets on my nerves.
   Sometimes I think she works at the lock on the door.

   "March 15--Still alive, despite all the strengthening of the dose.
   There's something queer about it. She crawls now, and doesn't pace very
   often. But the sound of her crawling is horrible. She rattles the
   windows, too, and fumbles with the door. I shall have to finish her off
   with the rawhide if this keeps up. I'm getting very sleepy. Wonder if
   Rose has got on her guard somehow. But she must be drinking the stuff.
   This sleepiness is abnormal--I think the strain is telling on me. I'm
   sleepy. . . ."

   (Here the cramped handwriting trails out in a vague scrawl, giving
   place to a note in a firmer, evidently feminine handwriting, indicative
   of great emotional tension.)

   "March 16--4 a.m.--This is added by Rose C. Morris, about to die.
   Please notify my father, Osborne E. Chandler, Route 2, Mountain Top,
   N.Y. I have just read what the beast has written. I felt sure he had
   killed Arthur Wheeler, but did not know how till I read this terrible
   notebook. Now I know what I escaped. I noticed the water tasted queer,
   so took none of it after the first sip. I threw it all out of the
   window. That one sip has half paralysed me, but I can still get about.
   The thirst was terrible, but I ate as little as possible of the salty
   food and was able to get a little water by setting some old pans and
   dishes that were up here under places where the roof leaked. "There
   were two great rains. I thought he was trying to poison me, though I
   didn't know what the poison was like. What he has written about himself
   and me is a lie. We were never happy together and I think I married him
   only under one of those spells that he was able to lay on people. I
   guess he hypnotised both my father and me, for he was always hated and
   feared and suspected of dark dealings with the devil. My father once
   called him The Devil's Kin, and he was right.

   "No one will ever know what I went through as his wife. It was not
   simply common cruelty--though God knows he was cruel enough, and beat
   me often with a leather whip. It was more--more than anyone in this age
   can ever understand. He was a monstrous creature, and practiced all
   sorts of hellish ceremonies handed down by his mother's people. He
   tried to make me help in the rites--and I don't dare even hint what
   they were. I would not, so he beat me. It would be blasphemy to tell
   what he tried to make me do. I can say he was a murderer even then, for
   I know what he sacrificed one night on Thunder Hill. He was surely the
   Devil's Kin. I tried four times to run away, but he always caught and
   beat me. Also, he had a sort of hold over my mind, and even over my
   father's mind.

   "About Arthur Wheeler I have nothing to be ashamed of. We did come to
   love each other, but only in an honourable way. He gave me the first
   kind treatment I had ever had since leaving my father's, and meant to
   help me get out of the clutches of that fiend. He had several talks
   with my father, and was going to help me get out west. After my divorce
   we would have been married.

   "Ever since that brute locked me in the attic I have planned to get out
   and finish him. I always kept the poison overnight in case I could
   escape and find him asleep and give it to him somehow. At first he
   waked easily when I worked on the lock of the door and tested the
   conditions at the windows, but later he began to get more tired and
   sleep sounder. I could always tell by his snoring when he was asleep.

   "Tonight he was so fast asleep I forced the lock without waking him. It
   was hard work getting downstairs with my partial paralysis, but I did.
   I found him here with the lamp burning--asleep at the table, where he
   had been writing in this book. In the corner was the long rawhide whip
   he had so often beaten me with. I used it to tie him to the chair so he
   could not move a muscle. I lashed his neck so that I could pour
   anything down his throat without his resisting.

   "He waked up just as I was finishing and I guess he saw right off that
   he was done for. He shouted frightful things and tried to chant
   mystical formulas, but I choked him off with a dish towel from the
   sink. Then I saw this book he had been writing in, and stopped to read
   it. The shock was terrible, and I almost fainted four or five times. My
   mind was not ready for such things. After that I talked to that fiend
   for two or three hours steady. I told him everything I had wanted to
   tell him through all the years I had been his slave, and a lot of other
   things that had to do with what I had read in this awful book.

   "He looked almost purple when I was through, and I think he was half
   delirious. Then I got a funnel from the cupboard and jammed it into his
   mouth after taking out the gag. He knew what I was going to do, but was
   helpless. I had brought down the pail of poisoned water, and without a
   qualm, I poured a good half of it into the funnel.

   "It must have been a very strong dose, for almost at once I saw that
   brute begin to stiffen and turn a dull stony grey. In ten minutes I
   knew he was solid stone. I could not bear to touch him, but the tin
   funnel clinked horribly when I pulled it out of his mouth. I wish I
   could have given that Kin of the Devil a more painful, lingering death,
   but surely this was the most appropriate he could have had. "There is
   not much more to say. I am half-paralysed, and with Arthur murdered I
   have nothing to live for. I shall make things complete by drinking the
   rest of the poison after placing this book where it will be found. In a
   quarter of an hour I shall be a stone statue. My only wish is to be
   buried beside the statue that was Arthur--when it is found in that cave
   where the fiend left it. Poor trusting Rex ought to lie at our feet. I

   The Messenger
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   12311The MessengerH. P. Lovecraft

   The thing, he said, would come in the night at three
   From the old churchyard on the hill below;
   But crouching by an oak fire's wholesome glow,
   I tried to tell myself it could not be.

   Surely, I mused, it was pleasantry
   Devised by one who did not truly know
   The Elder Sign, bequeathed from long ago,
   That sets the fumbling forms of darkness free.

   He had not meant it - no - but still I lit
   Another lamp as starry Leo climbed
   Out of the Seekonk, and a steeple chimed
   Three - and the firelight faded, bit by bit.

   Then at the door that cautious rattling came -
   And the mad truth devoured me like a flame!

The Moon-Bog

   The Moon Bog
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   14847The Moon BogH. P. Lovecraft

   Somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region I know not, Denys Barry
   has gone. I was with him the last night he lived among men, and heard
   his screams when the thing came to him; but all the peasants and police
   in County Meath could never find him, or the others, though they
   searched long and far. And now I shudder when I hear the frogs piping
   in swamps, or see the moon in lonely places.

   I had known Denys Barry well in America, where he had grown rich, and
   had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at
   sleepy Kilderry. It was from Kilderry that his father had come, and it
   was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes.
   Men of his blood had once ruled over Kilderry and built and dwelt in
   the castle, but those days were very remote, so that for generations
   the castle had been empty and decaying. After he went to Ireland, Barry
   wrote me often, and told me how under his care the gray castle was
   rising tower by tower to its ancient splendor, how the ivy was climbing
   slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago,
   and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with
   his gold from over the sea. But in time there came troubles, and the
   peasants ceased to bless him, and fled away instead as from a doom. And
   then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him, for he was lonely in
   the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and laborers
   he had brought from the North.

   The bog was the cause of all these troubles, as Barry told me the night
   I came to the castle. I had reached Kilderry in the summer sunset, as
   the gold of the sky lighted the green of the hills and groves and the
   blue of the bog, where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened
   spectrally. That sunset was very beautiful, but the peasants at
   Ballylough had warned me against it and said that Kilderry had become
   accursed, so that I almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the
   castle gilded with fire. Barry's motor had met me at the Ballylough
   station, for Kilderry is off the railway. The villagers had shunned the
   car and the driver from the North, but had whispered to me with pale
   faces when they saw I was going to Kilderry. And that night, after our
   reunion, Barry told me why.

   The peasants had gone from Kilderry because Denys Barry was to drain
   the great bog. For all his love of Ireland, America had not left him
   untouched, and he hated the beautiful wasted space where peat might be
   cut and land opened up. The legends and superstitions of Kilderry did
   not move him, and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help,
   and then cursed him and went away to Ballylough with their few
   belongings as they saw his determination. In their place he sent for
   laborers from the North, and when the servants left he replaced them
   likewise. But it was lonely among strangers, so Barry had asked me to
   come.

   When I heard the fears which had driven the people from Kilderry, I
   laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the
   vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character. They had to do with some
   preposterous legend of the bog, and a grim guardian spirit that dwelt
   in the strange olden ruin on the far islet I had seen in the sunset.
   There were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon, and of
   chill winds when the night was warm; of wraiths in white hovering over
   the waters, and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy
   surface. But foremost among the weird fancies, and alone in its
   absolute unanimity, was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare
   to touch or drain the vast reddish morass. There were secrets, said the
   peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden
   since the plague came to the children of Partholan in the fabulous
   years beyond history. In the Book of Invaders it is told that these
   sons of the Greeks were all buried at Tallaght, but old men in Kilderry
   said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon-goddess; so
   that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of Nemed swept down
   from Scythia in their thirty ships.

   Such were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave Kilderry,
   and when I heard them I did not wonder that Denys Barry had refused to
   listen. He had, however, a great interest in antiquities, and proposed
   to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained. The white ruins on
   the islet he had often visited, but though their age was plainly great,
   and their contour very little like that of most ruins in Ireland, they
   were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory. Now the work of
   drainage was ready to begin, and the laborers from the North were soon
   to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather, and kill
   the tiny shell-paved streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with
   rushes.

   After Barry had told me these things I was very drowsy, for the travels
   of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the
   night. A man-servant showed me to my room, which was in a remote tower
   overlooking the village and the plain at the edge of the bog, and the
   bog itself; so that I could see from my windows in the moonlight the
   silent roofs from which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered
   the laborers from the North, and too, the parish church with its
   antique spire, and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden
   ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral. Just as I dropped to
   sleep I fancied I heard faint sounds from the distance; sounds that
   were wild and half musical, and stirred me with a weird excitement
   which colored my dreams. But when I awaked next morning I felt it had
   all been a dream, for the visions I had seen were more wonderful than
   any sound of wild pipes in the night. Influenced by the legends that
   Barry had related, my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city
   in a green valley, where marble streets and statues, villas and
   temples, carvings and inscriptions, all spoke in certain tones the
   glory that was Greece. When I told this dream to Barry we had both
   laughed; but I laughed the louder, because he was perplexed about his
   laborers from the North. For the sixth time they had all overslept,
   waking very slowly and dazedly, and acting as if they had not rested,
   although they were known to have gone early to bed the night before.

   That morning and afternoon I wandered alone through the sun-gilded
   village and talked now and then with idle laborers, for Barry was busy
   with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage. The laborers
   were not as happy as they might have been, for most of them seemed
   uneasy over some dream which they had had, yet which they tried in vain
   to remember. I told them of my dream, but they were not interested till
   I spoke of the weird sounds I thought I had heard. Then they looked
   oddly at me, and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds, too.

   In the evening Barry dined with me and announced that he would begin
   the drainage in two days. I was glad, for although I disliked to see
   the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart, I had
   a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deep-matted peat
   might hide. And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble
   peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in
   the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a frightful avalanche
   of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left
   unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged
   moon-priestess Cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her
   silver head.

   I have said that I awaked suddenly and in alarm. For some time I could
   not tell whether I was waking or sleeping, for the sound of flutes
   still rang shrilly in my ears; but when I saw on the floor the icy
   moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed gothic window, I decided I
   must be awake and in the castle of Kilderry. Then I heard a clock from
   some remote landing below strike the hour of two, and knew I was awake.
   Yet still there came that monstrous piping from afar; wild, weird airs
   that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant Maenalus. It would
   not let me sleep, and in impatience I sprang up and paced the floor.
   Only by chance did I go to the north window and look out upon the
   silent village and the plain at the edge of the bog. I had no wish to
   gaze abroad, for I wanted to sleep; but the flutes tormented me, and I
   had to do or see something. How could I have suspected the thing I was
   to behold?

   There in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle
   which no mortal, having seen it, could ever forget. To the sound of
   reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there glided silently and eerily a
   mixed throng of swaying figures, reeling through such a revel as the
   Sicilians may have danced to Demeter in the old days under the harvest
   moon beside the Cyane. The wide plain, the golden moonlight, the
   shadowy moving forms, and above all the shrill monotonous piping,
   produced an effect which almost paralyzed me; yet I noted amidst my
   fear that half of these tireless mechanical dancers were the laborers
   whom I had thought asleep, whilst the other half were strange airy
   beings in white, half-indeterminate in nature, but suggesting pale
   wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog. I do not know how
   long I gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before I
   dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon, out of which the high sun of
   morning aroused me.

   My first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and
   observations to Denys Barry, but as I saw the sunlight glowing through
   the latticed east window I became sure that there was no reality in
   what I thought I had seen. I am given to strange fantasms, yet am never
   weak enough to believe in them; so on this occasion contented myself
   with questioning the laborers, who slept very late and recalled nothing
   of the previous night save misty dreams of shrill sounds. This matter
   of the spectral piping harassed me greatly, and I wondered if the
   crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and
   haunt the visions of men. Later in the day I watched Barry in the
   library poring over his plans for the great work which was to begin on
   the morrow, and for the first time felt a touch of the same kind of
   fear that had driven the peasants away. For some unknown reason I
   dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless
   secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured
   depth of age-old peat. That these secrets should be brought to light
   seemed injudicious, and I began to wish for an excuse to leave the
   castle and the village. I went so far as to talk casually to Barry on
   the subject, but did not dare continue after he gave his resounding
   laugh. So I was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills,
   and Kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portent.

   Whether the events of that night were of reality or illusion I shall
   never ascertain. Certainly they transcend anything we dream of in
   nature and the universe; yet in no normal fashion can I explain those
   disappearances which were known to all men after it was over. I retired
   early and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the
   uncanny silence of the tower. It was very dark, for although the sky
   was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would not rise till
   the small hours. I thought as I lay there of Denys Barry, and of what
   would befall that bog when the day came, and found myself almost
   frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night, take Barry's car,
   and drive madly to Ballylough out of the menaced lands. But before my
   fears could crystallize into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in
   dreams upon the city in the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of
   hideous shadow.

   Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was
   not what I noticed first when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my
   back to the east window overlooking the bog, where the waning moon
   would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite
   wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared.
   Light indeed glowed on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that
   the moon gives. Terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence
   that streamed through the gothic window, and the whole chamber was
   brilliant with a splendor intense and unearthly. My immediate actions
   were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man
   does the dramatic and foreseen thing. Instead of looking out across the
   bog toward the source of the new light, I kept my eyes from the window
   in panic fear, and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of
   escape. I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over
   I had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other. After
   a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright, and I
   crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening, incessant
   piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the
   village.

   Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and
   pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of
   that ruin I can not describe - I must have been mad, for it seemed to
   rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the
   flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the
   apex of a temple on a mountain-top. Flutes shrieked and drums began to
   beat, and as I watched in awe and terror I thought I saw dark saltant
   forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and
   effulgence. The effect was titanic - altogether unthinkable - and I
   might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed
   to grow stronger at my left. Trembling with a terror oddly mixed with
   ecstasy, I crossed the circular room to the north window from which I
   could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog. There my
   eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if I had not just
   turned from a scene beyond the pale of nature, for on the ghastly
   red-litten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as
   none ever saw before save in nightmares.

   Half gliding, half floating in the air, the white-clad bog-wraiths were
   slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in
   fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial
   dance. Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping
   of those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of
   lurching laborers who followed doglike with blind, brainless,
   floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless demon-will.
   As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line
   of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some
   door far below my window, groped sightiessly across the courtyard and
   through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering
   column of laborers on the plain. Despite their distance below me I at
   once knew they were the servants brought from the North, for I
   recognized the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very
   absurdness had now become unutterably tragic. The flutes piped
   horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction
   of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the
   water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of
   followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them
   and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could
   barely see in the scarlet light. And as the last pathetic straggler,
   the fat cook, sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool, the flutes
   and the drums grew silent, and the blinding red rays from the ruins
   snapped instantaneously out, leaving the village of doom lone and
   desolate in the wan beams of a new-risen moon.

   My condition was now one of indescribable chaos. Not knowing whether I
   was mad or sane, sleeping or waking, I was saved only by a merciful
   numbness. I believe I did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to
   Artemis, Latona, Demeter, Persephone, and Plouton. All that I recalled
   of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation
   roused my deepest superstitions. I felt that I had witnessed the death
   of a whole village, and knew I was alone in the castle with Denys
   Barry, whose boldness had brought down a doom. As I thought of him, new
   terrors convulsed me, and I fell to the floor; not fainting, but
   physically helpless. Then I felt the icy blast from the east window
   where the moon had risen, and began to hear the shrieks in the castle
   far below me. Soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality
   which can not be written of, and which makes me faint as I think of
   them. All I can say is that they came from something I had known as a
   friend.

   At some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the
   screaming must have roused me, for my next impression is of racing
   madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard
   into the hideous night. They found me at dawn wandering mindless near
   Ballylough, but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors I
   had seen or heard before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of
   the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my
   flight: incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me unceasingly
   when I am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight.

   As I fled from that accursed castle along the bog's edge I heard a new
   sound: common, yet unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The
   stagnant waters, lately quite devoid of animal life, now teemed with a
   horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in
   tones strangely out of keeping with their size. They glistened bloated
   and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of
   light. I followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog, and saw the
   second of the things which drove my senses away.

   Stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the
   waning moon, my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance
   having no reflection in the waters of the bog. And upward along that
   pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing; a
   vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen demons. Crazed
   as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance - a
   nauseous, unbelievable caricature - a blasphemous effigy of him who had
   been Denys Barry.

   8517The Music of Erich ZannH. P. Lovecraft

   I have examined maps of the city with the greatest care, yet have never
   again found the Rue d'Auseil. These maps have not been modern maps
   alone, for I know that names change. I have, on the contrary, delved
   deeply into all the antiquities of the place, and have personally
   explored every region, of whatever name, which could possibly answer to
   the street I knew as the Rue d'Auseil. But despite all I have done, it
   remains an humiliating fact that I cannot find the house, the street,
   or even the locality, where, during the last months of my impoverished
   life as a student of metaphysics at the university, I heard the music
   of Erich Zann.

   That my memory is broken, I do not wonder; for my health, physical and
   mental, was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in
   the Rue d'Auseil, and I recall that I took none of my few acquaintances
   there. But that I cannot find the place again is both singular and
   perplexing; for it was within a half-hour's walk of the university and
   was distinguished by peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by
   any one who had been there. I have never met a person who has seen the
   Rue d'Auseil.

   The Rue d'Auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick
   blear-windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark
   stone. It was always shadowy along that river, as if the smoke of
   neighboring factories shut out the sun perpetually. The river was also
   odorous with evil stenches which I have never smelled elsewhere, and
   which may some day help me to find it, since I should recognize them at
   once. Beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets with rails; and
   then came the ascent, at first gradual, but incredibly steep as the Rue
   d'Auseil was reached.

   I have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the Rue
   d'Auseil. It was almost a cliff, closed to all vehicles, consisting in
   several places of flights of steps, and ending at the top in a lofty
   ivied wall. Its paving was irregular, sometimes stone slabs, sometimes
   cobblestones, and sometimes bare earth with struggling greenish-grey
   vegetation. The houses were tall, peaked-roofed, incredibly old, and
   crazily leaning backward, forward, and sidewise. Occasionally an
   opposite pair, both leaning forward, almost met across the street like
   an arch; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground
   below. There were a few overhead bridges from house to house across the
   street.

   The inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly; At first I
   thought it was because they were all silent and reticent; but later
   decided it was because they were all very old. I do not know how I came
   to live on such a street, but I was not myself when I moved there. I
   had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money;
   until at last I came upon that tottering house in the Rue d'Auseil kept
   by the paralytic Blandot. It was the third house from the top of the
   street, and by far the tallest of them all.

   My room was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there, since
   the house was almost empty. On the night I arrived I heard strange
   music from the peaked garret overhead, and the next day asked old
   Blandot about it. He told me it was an old German viol-player, a
   strange dumb man who signed his name as Erich Zann, and who played
   evenings in a cheap theater orchestra; adding that Zann's desire to
   play in the night after his return from the theater was the reason he
   had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable
   window was the only point on the street from which one could look over
   the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond.

   Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I
   was haunted by the weirdness of his music. Knowing little of the art
   myself, I was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation
   to music I had heard before; and concluded that he was a composer of
   highly original genius. The longer I listened, the more I was
   fascinated, until after a week I resolved to make the old man's
   acquaintance.

   One night as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the
   hallway and told him that I would like to know him and be with him when
   he played. He was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue
   eyes, grotesque, satyrlike face, and nearly bald head; and at my first
   words seemed both angered and frightened. My obvious friendliness,
   however, finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow
   him up the dark, creaking and rickety attic stairs. His room, one of
   only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west side, toward
   the high wall that formed the upper end of the street. Its size was
   very great, and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary
   barrenness and neglect. Of furniture there was only a narrow iron
   bedstead, a dingy wash-stand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron
   music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs. Sheets of music were piled
   in disorder about the floor. The walls were of bare boards, and had
   probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs
   made the place seem more deserted than inhabited. Evidently Erich
   Zann's world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination.

   Motioning me to sit down, the dumb man closed the door, turned the
   large wooden bolt, and lighted a candle to augment the one he had
   brought with him. He now removed his viol from its motheaten covering,
   and taking it, seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs.
   He did not employ the music-rack, but, offering no choice and playing
   from memory, enchanted me for over an hour with strains I had never
   heard before; strains which must have been of his own devising. To
   describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music.
   They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most
   captivating quality, but to me were notable for the absence of any of
   the weird notes I had overheard from my room below on other occasions.

   Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and
   whistled inaccurately to myself, so when the player at length laid down
   his bow I asked him if he would render some of them. As I began my
   request the wrinkled satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had
   possessed during the playing, and seemed to show the same curious
   mixture of anger and fright which I had noticed when first I accosted
   the old man. For a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding
   rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my
   host's weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had
   listened the night before. But I did not pursue this course for more
   than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognized the whistled air
   his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond
   analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my
   mouth and silence the crude imitation. As he did this he further
   demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the
   lone curtained window, as if fearful of some intruder--a glance doubly
   absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the
   adjacent roofs, this window being the only point on the steep street,
   as the concierge had told me, from which one could see over the wall at
   the summit.

   The old man's glance brought Blandot's remark to my mind, and with a
   certain capriciousness I felt a wish to look out over the wide and
   dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop,
   which of all the dwellers in the Rue d'Auseil only this crabbed
   musician could see. I moved toward the window and would have drawn
   aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened rage even
   greater than before, the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time
   motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag
   me thither with both hands. Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I
   ordered him to release me, and told him I would go at once. His clutch
   relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offense, his own anger seemed to
   subside. He tightened his relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly
   manner, forcing me into a chair; then with an appearance of wistfulness
   crossing to the littered table, where he wrote many words with a
   pencil, in the labored French of a foreigner.

   The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and
   forgiveness. Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with
   strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with
   other things. He had enjoyed my listening to his music, and wished I
   would come again and not mind his eccentricities. But he could not play
   to another his weird harmonies, and could not bear hearing them from
   another; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by
   an-other. He had not known until our hallway conversation that I could
   overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would arrange
   with Blandot to take a lower room where I could not hear him in the
   night. He would, he wrote, defray the difference in rent.

   As I sat deciphering the execrable French, I felt more lenient toward
   the old man. He was a victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was
   I; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness. In the silence
   there came a slight sound from the window--the shutter must have
   rattled in the night wind, and for some reason I started almost as
   violently as did Erich Zann. So when I had finished reading, I shook my
   host by the hand, and departed as a friend.

   The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor,
   between the apartments of an aged money-lender and the room of a
   respectable upholsterer. There was no one on the fourth floor.

   It was not long before I found that Zann's eagerness for my company was
   not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down
   from the fifth story. He did not ask me to call on him, and when I did
   call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly. This was always at
   night--in the day he slept and would admit no one. My liking for him
   did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold
   an odd fascination for me. I had a curious desire to look out of that
   window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs
   and spires which must lie outspread there. Once I went up to the garret
   during theater hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked.

   What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of
   the dumb old man. At first I would tip-toe up to my old fifth floor,
   then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the
   peaked garret. There in the narrow hall, outside the bolted door with
   the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds which filled me with an
   indefinable dread--the dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery. It
   was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were not; but that they
   held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at
   certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly
   conceive as produced by one player. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius
   of wild power. As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the
   old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful
   to behold. He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me
   whenever we met on the stairs.

   Then one night as I listened at the door, I heard the shrieking viol
   swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led
   me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that
   barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real--the awful,
   inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in
   moments of the most terrible fear or anguish. I knocked repeatedly at
   the door, but received no response. Afterward I waited in the black
   hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician's
   feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair. Believing
   him just conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the
   same time calling out my name reassuringly. I heard Zann stumble to the
   window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which
   he falteringly unfastened to admit me. This time his delight at having
   me present was real; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while
   he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mother's skirts.

   Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank
   into another, beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the
   floor. He sat for some time inactive, nodding oddly, but having a
   paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening.
   Subsequently he seemed to be satisfied, and crossing to a chair by the
   table wrote a brief note, handed it to me, and returned to the table,
   where he began to write rapidly and incessantly. The note implored me
   in the name of mercy, and for the sake of my own curiosity, to wait
   where I was while he prepared a full account in German of all the
   marvels and terrors which beset him. I waited, and the dumb man's
   pencil flew.

   It was perhaps an hour later, while I still waited and while the old
   musician's feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up, that I
   saw Zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock. Unmistakably he
   was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly. Then I
   half fancied I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible
   sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical
   note, suggesting a player in one of the neighboring houses, or in some
   abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look.
   Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for, dropping his pencil, suddenly
   he rose, seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the
   wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save when listening at
   the barred door.

   It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that
   dreadful night. It was more horrible than anything I had ever
   overheard, because I could now see the expression of his face, and
   could realize that this time the motive was stark fear. He was trying
   to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something out--what, I
   could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be. The playing grew
   fantastic, delirious, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the
   qualities of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man
   possessed. I recognized the air--it was a wild Hungarian dance popular
   in the theaters, and I reflected for a moment that this was the first
   time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer.

   Louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining
   of that desperate viol. The player was dripping with an uncanny
   perspiration and twisted like a monkey, always looking frantically at
   the curtained window. In his frenzied strains I could almost see
   shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through
   seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning. And then I thought
   I heard a shriller, steadier note that was not from the viol; a calm,
   deliberate, purposeful, mocking note from far away in the West.

   At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind
   which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within.
   Zann's screaming viol now outdid itself emitting sounds I had never
   thought a viol could emit. The shutter rattled more loudly, unfastened,
   and commenced slamming against the window. Then the glass broke
   shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in,
   making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the
   table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible secret. I looked
   at Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation. His blue eyes
   were bulging, glassy and sightless, and the frantic playing had become
   a blind, mechanical, unrecognizable orgy that no pen could even
   suggest.

   A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and
   bore it toward the window. I followed the flying sheets in desperation,
   but they were gone before I reached the demolished panes. Then I
   remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only window in the
   Rue d'Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and
   the city outspread beneath. It was very dark, but the city's lights
   always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst the rain and
   wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, looked
   while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the
   night-wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleamed
   from remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable;
   unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance
   of anything on earth. And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind
   blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in
   savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me,
   and the demon madness of that night-baying viol behind me.

   I staggered back in the dark, without the means of striking a light,
   crashing against the table, overturning a chair, and finally groping my
   way to the place where the blackness screamed with shocking music. To
   save myself and Erich Zann I could at least try, whatever the powers
   opposed to me. Once I thought some chill thing brushed me, and I
   screamed, but my scream could not be heard above that hideous viol.
   Suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me, and I
   knew I was close to the player. I felt ahead, touched the back of
   Zann's chair, and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to
   bring him to his senses.

   He did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening.
   I moved my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding I was able to
   stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown
   things of the night. But he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy
   of his unutterable music, while all through the garret strange currents
   of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and babel. When my hand touched
   his ear I shuddered, though I knew not why--knew not why till I felt
   the still face; the ice-cold, stiffened, unbreathing face whose glassy
   eyes bulged uselessly into the void. And then, by some miracle, finding
   the door and the large wooden bolt, I plunged wildly away from that
   glassy-eyed thing in the dark, and from the ghoulish howling of that
   accursed viol whose fury increased even as I plunged.

   Leaping, floating, flying down those endless stairs through the dark
   house; racing mindlessly out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street
   of steps and tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles
   to the lower streets and the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across
   the great dark bridge to the broader, healthier streets and boulevards
   we know; all these are terrible impressions that linger with me. And I
   recall that there was no wind, and that the moon was out, and that all
   the lights of the city twinkled.

   Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since
   been able to find the Rue d'Auseil. But I am not wholly sorry; either
   for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely-written
   sheets which alone could have explained the music of Erich Zann.

   1406215The Mysterious ShipH. P. Lovecraft1902

   [Short Version]

   The Royal Press 1902

   Chapter 1.

   In the spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into
   a state of exitement by the arrival of a strange brig in the harbour.
   It carried no flag, & everything about it was such as would exite
   suspicion. It had no name. Its captain was named Manuel Ruello. The
   exitement increased however when John Griggs dissapeared from his home.
   This was Oct. 4. on Oct. 5 the brig was gone.

   Chapter 2.

   The brig, in leaving, was met by a U.S. Frigate and a sharp fight
   ensued. When over, they* missed a man. named Henry Johns.

   *(The Frigate.)

   Chapter 3.

   The brig continued its course in the direction of Madagascar, upon its
   arrival, The natives fled in all directions. When they came together on
   the other side of the island, one was missing. His name was Dahabea.

   Chapter 4.

   At length it was decided that something must be done. A reward of
   £5,000 was offered for the capture of Manuel Ruello., When startling
   news came, a nameless brig was wrecked on the Florida Keys.

   Chapter 5.

   A ship was sent to Florida, and the mystery was solved. In the
   exitement of the fight they would launch a sub-marine boat and take
   what they wanted. there it lay, tranquilly rocking on the waters of the
   Atlantic when someone called out "John Brown has dissapeared." And sure
   enough John Brown was gone.

   Chapter 6.

   The finding of the sub-marine boat, and the dissapearance of John
   Brown, caused renewed exitement amongst the people, when a new
   discovery was made. In transcribing this discovery it is necessary to
   relate a geographical fact. At the N. Pole there exists a vast
   continent composed of volcanic soil, a portion of which is open to
   explorers. It is called "No-Mans Land."

   Chapter 7.

   In the extreme southern part of No-Mans Land, there was found a hut,
   and several other signs of human habitation. they promptly entered,
   and, chained to the floor, lay Griggs, Johns, & Dahabea. They, upon
   arriving in London, separated, Griggs going to Ruralville, Johns to the
   Frigate, & Dahabea to Madagascar.

   Chapter 8.

   But the mystery of John Brown was still unsolved, so they kept strict
   watch over the port at No-Mans Land, and when the sub-marine boat
   arrived, and the pirates, one by one, and headed by Manuel Ruello, left
   the ship, they were met by a rapid fire. After the fight brown was
   recovered.

   Chapter 9.

   Griggs was royally recieved at Ruralville, & a dinner was given in
   honour of Henry Johns, Dahabea was made King of Madagascar., & Brown
   was made Captain of his ship.

   THE END.

   [Long Version]

   By Anonymus

   In the Spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into
   a state of excitement by the landing of a strange Brig in the harbour.
   It carried no flag, and no name was painted on its side, and everything
   about it was such as would excite suspicion. It was from Tripoli,
   Africa, and the captain was named Manuel Ruello. The Excitement
   increased, however; when John Griggs, (The magnate of the villiage)
   suddenly disappeared from his home. This was the night of October
   4th--on October 5th the Brig left.

   Chapter II

   It was 8 bells on the U.S. Frigate "Constitution" when Commander
   Farragut sighted a strange brig to the westward. It carried no flag,
   and no name was painted on its side, and everything about it was such
   as would excite suspicion. On hailing it put up the Pirates Flag.
   Farragut ordered a gun fired and no sooner did he fire, than the pirate
   ship gave them a broadside when the Fight was over Commander Farragut
   Missed one man named Henry F. Johns.

   Chapter III

   It was Summer on the Island of Madagascar. And Natives were picking
   corn, when one cried "Companions! I sight a ship! with no flag and with
   no name printed on the side and with everything about it such as would
   excite Suspicion!" And The Natives fled in all directions when They
   came together on The other side of The Island one was missing his name
   was Dahabea.

   Chapter IV

   At length it was Decided Something must be done, Notes were compared.
   Three abductions were found to have taken place Dissapearance of John
   Griggs, Henry John, & Dahabea, were recalled. Finally Advertisements
   were issued offering £5000 reward for the capture of Manuel Ruello,
   Ship, Prisoners, & crew. When exciting News reached London! An unknown
   Brig with no name was wrecked of The Florida Keys in America!

   Chapter V

   The People Hurried to Florida and Beheld------. A steel spindle shaped
   object Lay placidly on the water Beside the shattered wreck of The
   brig. "A Submarine Boat"! shouted one "Yes!" shouted another "The
   mystery is cleared" said a wise looking man. "In the excitement of the
   fight they launch the submarine boat and take as many as they wish,
   unseen. And------." "John Brown has disappeared"! shouted a voice from
   the deck. Sure enough John Brown was gone!

   Chapter VI

   The Finding of The Submarine boat and the dissapearance of John Brown
   caused renewed excitement among the People, and a new discovery was
   made. In relating this discovery It is necessary to relate a
   geographical Fact:-- At the North Pole there is supposed to exist a
   vast continent composed of volcanic soil, a portion is open to
   travellers and explorers but it is barren and unfruitful. and thus
   absolutely Impassable. It is called "No-Mans Land."

   Chapter VII

   In the Extreme southern part of No-Mans Land There was found a wharf
   and a hut &c and every sign of former human habitation. A rusty
   door-plate was nailed to the hut inscribed in old English "M. Ruello."
   This, then, was the home of Michael Ruello. the house brought to light
   a note book belonging to John Griggs, and The Log of the "Constitution"
   taken from Henry Johns, and the Madagascar Reaper belong To Dahabea.

   Chapter VIII

   When about to leave, they Observed a spring on the side of the hut.
   They pressed it.--A hole appeared in the side of the hut which they
   promptly entered. They were in a subterranean cavern, the beach ran
   down to the edge of a black, murky, sea. on the sea lay a dark oblong
   object--viz another Submarine boat which they entered. There bound to

   1406217The Mystery of the Grave-Yard or "A Dead Man's Revenge"H. P.
   Lovecraft1898-1899

   Chapter I
   The Burns's Tomb.

   It was noon in the Little village of Mainville, and a sorrowful group
   of people were standing around the Burns's Tomb. Joseph Burns was dead.
   (when dying, he had given the following strange orders:--"Before you
   put my body in the tomb, drop this ball onto the floor, at a spot
   marked "A"." he then handed a small golden ball to the rector.) The
   people greatly regretted his death. After The funeral services were
   finished, Mr Dobson (the rector) said, "My friends, I will now gratify
   the last wishes of the deceased. So saying, he descended into the tomb.
   (to lay the ball on the spot marked "A") Soon the funeral party Began
   to be impatient, and after a time Mr. Cha's. Greene (the Lawyer)
   descended to make a search. Soon he came up with a frightened face, and
   said, "Mr Dobson is not there"!

   Chapter II
   Mysterious Mr. Bell.

   It was 3.10 o'clock in ye afternoone whenne The door bell of the Dobson
   mansion rang loudly, and the servant on going to the door, found an
   elderly man, with black hair, and side whiskers. He asked to see Miss
   Dobson. Upon arriving in her presence he said, "Miss Dobson, I know
   where your father is, and for £10,000 I will restore him. My name is
   Mr. Bell." "Mr. Bell," said Miss Dobson, "will you excuse me from the
   room a moment?" "Certainly". replied Mr Bell. In a short time she
   returned, and said, "Mr. Bell, I understand you. You have abducted my
   father, and hold him for a ransom"

   Chapter III
   At The Police Station.

   It was 3.20 o'clock in the afternoon when the telephone bell at the
   North End Police Station rang furiously, and Gibson, (the telephone
   Man) Inquired what was the matter,

   "Have found out about fathers dissapearance"! a womans voice said. "Im
   Miss Dobson, and father has been abducted, "Send King John"! King John
   was a famous western detective. Just then a man rushed in, and shouted,
   "Oh! Terrors! Come To the Graveyard!"

   Chapter IV
   The West window.

   Now let us return to the Dobson Mansion. Mr Bell was rather taken aback
   by Miss Dobson's plain speaking, but when he recovered his speech he
   said, "Don't put it quite so plain, Miss Dobson, for I--" He was
   interrupted by the entrance of King John, who with a brace of revolvers
   in his hands, barred all egress by the doorway. But quicker than
   thought Bell sprang to a west window,--and jumped.

   Chapter V
   The Secret of The grave.

   Now let us return to the station house. After the exited visitor had
   calmed somewhat, he could tell his story straighter. He had seen three
   men in the graveyard shouting "Bell! Bell! where are you old man!?" and
   acting very suspiciously. He then followed them, and they entered The
   Burns's Tomb! He then followed them in and they touched a spring at a
   point marked "A" and then Dissapeared". "I wish king John were here",
   Said Gibson, "What's your name,"? "John Spratt". replied the visitor.

   Chapter VI
   The chase for Bell.

   Now let us return To the Dobson Mansion again:--King John was utterly
   confounded at the Sudden movement of Bell, but when he recovered from
   his surprise, his first thought was of chase. Accordingly, he started
   in pursuit of the abductor. He tracked him down to the R. R. Station
   and found to his dismay that he had taken the train for Kent, a large
   city toward the south, and between which and Mainville there existed no
   telegraph or telephone. The train had Just Started!

   Chapter VII
   The Negro Hackman.

   The Kent train started at 10.35, and about 10.36 an exited, dusty, and
   tired man^1 rushed into the Mainville hack. office and said to a negro
   hackman who was standing by the door--"If you can take me to Kent in 15
   minutes I will give you a dollar". "I doan' see how I'm ter git there",
   said the negro "I hab'n't got a decent pair of hosses an' I hab--" "Two
   Dollars"! Shouted The Traveller, "all right" said the Hackman.

          ^1 King John.

   Chapter VIII
   Bells Surprise.

   It was 11 o'clock at Kent, all of the stores were closed but one, a
   dingy, dirty, little shop, down at the west end. It lay between Kent
   Harbour, & the Kent & Mainville R.R. In the Front room a shabbily
   dressed person of doubtful age was conversing with a middle aged woman
   with gray haire, "I have agreed to do the job, Lindy," he said, "Bell
   will arrive at 11.30 and the carraige is ready to take him down to the
   wharf, where a ship for Africa sails to-nighte".

   "But If King John were to come?" queried "Lindy"

   "Then we'd get nabbed, an' Bell would be hung" Replied The man.

   Just then a rap sounded at the door "Are you Bell"? inquired Lindy
   "Yes" was the response, "And I caught the 10.35 and King John got Left,
   so we are all right". At 11.40 the party reached The Landing, and saw a
   ship Loom up in the darkness. "The Kehdive" "of Africa" was painted on
   the hull, and Just as they were to step on board, a man stepped forward
   in the darkness and said "John Bell, I arrest you in the Queen's name"!

   It was King John.

   Chapter IX
   The Trial.

   The daye of The Trial had arrived, and a crowd of people had gathered
   around the Little grove, (which served for a court house in summer) To
   hear the trial of John Bell on the charge of kid-napping. "Mr. Bell,"
   said the judge "what is the secret of the Burns's tomb"

   "I well tell you this much" said Bell, "If you go into the tomb and
   touch a certain spot marked "A" you will find out"

   "Now where is Mr Dobson"? queried the judge, "Here"! said a voice
   behind them, and The figure of Mr Dobson HIMSELF loomed up in the
   doorway.

   "How did you get here"!&c was chorused. "'Tis a long story," said
   Dobson.

   Chapter X
   Dobson's Story.

   "When I went down into the tomb," Said Dobson, "Everything was
   darkness, I could see nothing. but Finally I discerned the letter "A"
   printed in white on the onyx floor, I dropped the ball on the Letter,
   and immediately a trap-door opened and a man sprang up. It was this
   man, here," (he said (pointing at Bell, who stood Trembling on the
   prisoner's docke) "and he pulled me down into a brilliantly lighted,
   and palatial apartment where I have Lived until to-day. One day a young
   man rushed in and exclaimed "The secret Is revealed!" and was gone. He
   did not see me. Once Bell left his key behind, and I took the
   impression in wax, and the next day was spent in filing keys to fit the
   Lock. The next day my key fitted. and the next day (which is to-day) I
   escaped."

   Chapter XI
   The Mystery unveiled.

   "Why did the late J. Burns, ask you to put the ball there"? (at "A"?)
   queried the Judge? "To get me into trouble" replied Dobson "He, and
   Francis Burns, (his brother) have plotted against me for years, and I
   knew not, in what way they would harm me". "Sieze Francis Burns"!
   yelled the Judge.

   Chapter XII
   Conclusion.

   Francis Burns, and John Bell, were sent to prison for life. Mr Dobson
   was cordially welcomed by his daughter, who, by the way had become Mrs
   King John. "Lindy" and her accomplice were sent to Newgate for 30 days
   as aidors and abbettors of a criminal escape.

   The End.

   6474The Nameless CityH. P. Lovecraft

   When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed. I was
   traveling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon, and afar I
   saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may
   protrude from an ill-made grave. Fear spoke from the age-worn stones of
   this hoary survivor of the deluge, this great-grandfather of the eldest
   pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from
   antique and sinister secrets that no man should see, and no man else
   had dared to see..

   Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and
   inarticulate, its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted
   ages. It must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were
   laid, and while the bricks of Babylon were yet unbaked. There is no
   legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it was ever
   alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered
   about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it
   without wholly knowing why. It was of this place that Abdul Alhazred
   the mad poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained
   couplet:

     That is not dead which can eternal lie,
     And with strange aeons even death may die.

   I should have known that the Arabs had good reason for shunning the
   nameless city, the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living
   man, yet I defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel.
   I alone have seen it, and that is why no other face bears such hideous
   lines of fear as mine; why no other man shivers so horribly when the
   night wind rattles the windows. When I came upon it in the ghastly
   stillness of unending sleep it looked at me, chilly from the rays of a
   cold moon amidst the desert's heat. And as I returned its look I forgot
   my triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for
   the dawn.

   For hours I waited, till the east grew grey and the stars faded, and
   the grey turned to roseate light edged with gold. I heard a moaning and
   saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky
   was clear and the vast reaches of desert still. Then suddenly above the
   desert's far rim came the blazing edge of the sun, seen through the
   tiny sandstorm which was passing away, and in my fevered state I
   fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal
   to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.
   My ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across
   the sand to that unvocal place; that place which I alone of living men
   had seen.

   In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places I
   wandered, finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men,
   if men they were, who built this city and dwelt therein so long ago.
   The antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed to encounter
   some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by
   mankind. There were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins
   which I did not like. I had with me many tools, and dug much within the
   walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and nothing
   significant was revealed. When night and the moon returned I felt a
   chill wind which brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in
   the city. And as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small
   sighing sandstorm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stones
   though the moon was bright and most of the desert still.

   I awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams, my ears
   ringing as from some metallic peal. I saw the sun peering redly through
   the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless
   city, and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape. Once more
   I ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand
   like an ogre under a coverlet, and again dug vainly for relics of the
   forgotten race. At noon I rested, and in the afternoon I spent much
   time tracing the walls and bygone streets, and the outlines of the
   nearly vanished buildings. I saw that the city had been mighty indeed,
   and wondered at the sources of its greatness. To myself I pictured all
   the spendours of an age so distant that Chaldaea could not recall it,
   and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when
   mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before
   mankind existed.

   All at once I came upon a place where the bed rock rose stark through
   the sand and formed a low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to
   promise further traces of the antediluvian people. Hewn rudely on the
   face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small, squat
   rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of
   ages too remote for calculation, though sandstorms had long effaced any
   carvings which may have been outside.

   Very low and sand-choked were all the dark apertures near me, but I
   cleared on with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to
   reveal whatever mysteries it might hold. When I was inside I saw that
   the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that
   had lived and worshiped before the desert was a desert. Primitive
   altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and
   though I saw no sculptures or frescoes, there were many singular stones
   clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness of the
   chiseled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly kneel upright;
   but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a
   time. I shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars
   and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting and
   inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have
   made and frequented such a temple. When I had seen all that the place
   contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the temples might
   yield.

   Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made
   curiosity stronger than fear, so that I did not flee from the long
   mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first I saw the nameless
   city. In the twilight I cleared another aperture and with a new torch
   crawled into it, finding more vague stones and symbols, though nothing
   more definite than the other temple had contained. The room was just as
   low, but much less broad, ending in a very narrow passage crowded with
   obscure and cryptical shrines. About these shrines I was prying when
   the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the stillness
   and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast.

   The moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins, lighting a
   dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind
   from some point along the cliff ahead of me. I knew it was this chilly,
   sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a
   place of better shelter when I chanced to glance up and saw that there
   was no wind atop the cliff. This astonished me and made me fearful
   again, but I immediately recalled the sudden local winds that I had
   seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset, and judged it was a normal
   thing. I decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave, and
   watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving
   that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south
   of me, almost out of sight. Against the choking sand-cloud I plodded
   toward this temple, which as I neared it loomed larger than the rest,
   and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand. I would have
   entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my
   torch. It poured madly out of the dark door, sighing uncannily as it
   ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins. Soon it grew fainter
   and the sand grew more and more still, till finally all was at rest
   again; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the
   city, and when I glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though
   mirrored in unquiet waters. I was more afraid than I could explain, but
   not enough to dull my thirst for wonder; so as soon as the wind was
   quite gone I crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come.

   This temple, as I had fancied from the outside, was larger than either
   of those I had visited before; and was presumably a natural cavern
   since it bore winds from some region beyond. Here I could stand quite
   upright, but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the
   other temples. On the walls and roof I beheld for the first time some
   traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race, curious curling
   streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away; and on two of
   the altars I saw with rising excitement a maze of well-fashioned
   curvilinear carvings. As I held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the
   shape of the roof was too regular to be natural, and I wondered what
   the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon. Their
   engineering skill must have been vast.

   Then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which I
   had been seeking, the opening to those remoter abysses whence the
   sudden wind had blown; and I grew faint when I saw that it was a small
   and plainly artificial door chiseled in the solid rock. I thrust my
   torch within, beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a
   rough flight of very small, numerous and steeply descending steps. I
   shall always see those steps in my dreams, for I came to learn what
   they meant. At the time I hardly knew whether to call them steps or
   mere footholds in a precipitous descent. My mind was whirling with mad
   thoughts, and the words and warning of Arab prophets seemed to float
   across the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that
   men dare not know. Yet I hesitated only for a moment before advancing
   through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep
   passage, feet first, as though on a ladder.

   It is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any
   other man can have such a descent as mine. The narrow passage led
   infinitely down like some hideous haunted well, and the torch I held
   above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which I was
   crawling. I lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch,
   though I was frightened when I thought of the distance I must have been
   traversing. There were changes of direction and of steepness; and once
   I came to a long, low, level passage where I had to wriggle my feet
   first along the rocky floor, holding torch at arm's length beyond my
   head. The place was not high enough for kneeling. After that were more
   of the steep steps, and I was still scrambling down interminably when
   my failing torch died out. I do not think I noticed it at the time, for
   when I did notice it I was still holding it above me as if it were
   ablaze. I was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and
   the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of
   far, ancient, and forbidden places.

   In the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished
   treasury of daemonic lore; sentences from Alhazred the mad Arab,
   paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of Damascus, and infamous
   lines from the delirious Image du Monde of Gauthier de Metz. I repeated
   queer extracts, and muttered of Afrasiab and the daemons that floated
   with him down the Oxus; later chanting over and over again a phrase
   from one of Lord Dunsany's tales--"The unreveberate blackness of the
   abyss." Once when the descent grew amazingly steep I recited something
   in sing-song from Thomas Moore until I feared to recite more:

     A reservoir of darkness, black

     As witches' cauldrons are, when fill'd
     With moon-drugs in th' eclipse distill'd
     Leaning to look if foot might pass
     Down thro' that chasm, I saw, beneath,
     As far as vision could explore,
     The jetty sides as smooth as glass,
     Looking as if just varnish'd o'er
     With that dark pitch the Seat of Death
     Throws out upon its slimy shore.

   Time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor,
   and I found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two
   smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head. I could not
   quite stand, but could kneel upright, and in the dark I shuffled and
   crept hither and thither at random. I soon knew that I was in a narrow
   passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts.
   As in that Palaeozoic and abysmal place I felt of such things as
   polished wood and glass I shuddered at the possible implications. The
   cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular
   intervals, and were oblong and horizontal, hideously like coffins in
   shape and size. When I tried to move two or three for further
   examination, I found that they were firmly fastened.

   I saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a
   creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in
   the blackness; crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my
   surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched
   on. Man is so used to thinking visually that I almost forgot the
   darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its
   low-studded monotony as though I saw it. And then in a moment of
   indescribable emotion I did see it.

   Just when my fancy merged into real sight I cannot tell; but there came
   a gradual glow ahead, and all at once I knew that I saw the dim
   outlines of a corridor and the cases, revealed by some unknown
   subterranean phosphorescence. For a little while all was exactly as I
   had imagined it, since the glow was very faint; but as I mechanically
   kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light I realized that my fancy
   had been but feeble. This hall was no relic of crudity like the temples
   in the city above, but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic
   art. Rich, vivid, and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a
   continuous scheme of mural paintings whose lines and colours were
   beyond description. The cases were of a strange golden wood, with
   fronts of exquisite glass, and containing the mummified forms of
   creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man.

   To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible. They were of
   the reptile kind, with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile,
   sometimes the seal, but more often nothing of which either the
   naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard. In size they approximated
   a small man, and their fore-legs bore delicate and evident feet
   curiously like human hands and fingers. But strangest of all were their
   heads, which presented a contour violating all known biological
   principles. To nothing can such things be well compared--in one flash I
   thought of comparisons as varied as the cat, the bullfrog, the mythic
   Satyr, and the human being. Not Jove himself had had so colossal and
   protuberant a forehead, yet the horns and the noselessness and the
   alligator-like jaw placed things outside all established categories. I
   debated for a time on the reality of the mummies, half suspecting they
   were artificial idols; but soon decided they were indeed some
   palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive. To
   crown their grotesqueness, most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the
   costliest of fabrics, and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold,
   jewels, and unknown shining metals.

   The importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast, for
   they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and
   ceiling. With matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of
   their own, wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their
   dimensions; and I could not help but think that their pictured history
   was allegorical, perhaps shewing the progress of the race that
   worshiped them. These creatures, I said to myself, were to men of the
   nameless city what the she-wolf was to Rome, or some totem-beast is to
   a tribe of Indians.

   Holding this view, I could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the
   nameless city; the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the
   world before Africa rose out of the waves, and of its struggles as the
   sea shrank away, and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held
   it. I saw its wars and triumphs, its troubles and defeats, and
   afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its
   people--here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles--were
   driven to chisel their way down though the rocks in some marvelous
   manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them. It was
   all vividly weird and realistic, and its connection with the awesome
   descent I had made was unmistakable. I even recognized the passages.

   As I crept along the corridor toward the brighter light I saw later
   stages of the painted epic--the leave-taking of the race that had dwelt
   in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years; the
   race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so
   long where they had settled as nomads in the earth's youth, hewing in
   the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they had never ceased to
   worship. Now that the light was better I studied the pictures more
   closely and, remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the
   unknown men, pondered upon the customs of the nameless city. Many
   things were peculiar and inexplicable. The civilization, which included
   a written alphabet, had seemingly risen to a higher order than those
   immeasurably later civilizations of Egypt and Chaldaea, yet there were
   curious omissions. I could, for example, find no pictures to represent
   deaths or funeral customs, save such as were related to wars, violence,
   and plagues; and I wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural
   death. It was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a
   cheering illusion.

   Still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost
   picturesqueness and extravagance: contrasted views of the nameless city
   in its desertion and growing ruin, and of the strange new realm of
   paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone. In
   these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by
   moonlight, golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls, and
   half-revealing the splendid perfection of former times, shown
   spectrally and elusively by the artist. The paradisal scenes were
   almost too extravagant to be believed, portraying a hidden world of
   eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys.
   At the very last I thought I saw signs of an artistic anticlimax. The
   paintings were less skillful, and much more bizarre than even the
   wildest of the earlier scenes. They seemed to record a slow decadence
   of the ancient stock, coupled with a growing ferocity toward the
   outside world from which it was driven by the desert. The forms of the
   people--always represented by the sacred reptiles--appeared to be
   gradually wasting away, though their spirit as shewn hovering above the
   ruins by moonlight gained in proportion. Emaciated priests, displayed
   as reptiles in ornate robes, cursed the upper air and all who breathed
   it; and one terrible final scene shewed a primitive-looking man,
   perhaps a pioneer of ancient Irem, the City of Pillars, torn to pieces
   by members of the elder race. I remember how the Arabs fear the
   nameless city, and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and
   ceiling were bare.

   As I viewed the pageant of mural history I had approached very closely
   to the end of the low-ceiled hall, and was aware of a gate through
   which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence. Creeping up to it,
   I cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond; for instead
   of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of
   uniform radiance, such one might fancy when gazing down from the peak
   of Mount Everest upon a sea of sunlit mist. Behind me was a passage so
   cramped that I could not stand upright in it; before me was an infinity
   of subterranean effulgence.

   Reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep
   flight of steps--small numerous steps like those of black passages I
   had traversed--but after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed
   everything. Swung back open against the left-hand wall of the passage
   was a massive door of brass, incredibly thick and decorated with
   fantastic bas-reliefs, which could if closed shut the whole inner world
   of light away from the vaults and passages of rock. I looked at the
   step, and for the nonce dared not try them. I touched the open brass
   door, and could not move it. Then I sank prone to the stone floor, my
   mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like
   exhaustion could banish.

   As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had
   lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible
   significance--scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday--the
   vegetations of the valley around it, and the distant lands with which
   its merchants traded. The allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me
   by its universal prominence, and I wondered that it would be so closely
   followed in a pictured history of such importance. In the frescoes the
   nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles. I
   wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and
   reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins. I
   thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the
   underground corridor, which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference
   to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the
   worshipers to crawling. Perhaps the very rites here involved crawling
   in imitation of the creatures. No religious theory, however, could
   easily explain why the level passages in that awesome descent should be
   as low as the temples--or lower, since one cold not even kneel in it.
   As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified forms
   were so close to me, I felt a new throb of fear. Mental associations
   are curious, and I shrank from the idea that except for the poor
   primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting, mine was the only
   human form amidst the many relics and symbols of the primordial life.

   But as always in my strange and roving existence, wonder soon drove out
   fear; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a
   problem worthy of the greatest explorer. That a weird world of mystery
   lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps I could not doubt,
   and I hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted
   corridor had failed to give. The frescoes had pictured unbelievable
   cities, and valleys in this lower realm, and my fancy dwelt on the rich
   and colossal ruins that awaited me.

   My fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even
   the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead
   reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and
   faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal
   dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul. An
   ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from
   the primal stones and rock-hewn temples of the nameless city, while the
   very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and
   continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some
   vaguely familiar outlines. Of what could have happened in the
   geological ages since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race
   resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say. Life had once teemed
   in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with
   vivid relics, and I trembled to think of the countless ages through
   which these relics had kept a silent deserted vigil.

   Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had
   intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and
   the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found
   myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along
   the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. My
   sensations were like those which had made me shun the nameless city at
   night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant. In another
   moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a
   definite sound--the first which had broken the utter silence of these
   tomb-like depths. It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of
   condemned spirits, and came from the direction in which I was staring.
   Its volume rapidly grew, till it soon reverberated rightfully through
   the low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an
   increasing draught of old air, likewise flowing from the tunnels and
   the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, for
   I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth
   of the abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed revealed
   the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was
   near, so bracing myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to
   its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening. My fear again waned
   low, since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the
   unknown.

   More and more madly poured the shrieking, moaning night wind into the
   gulf of the inner earth. I dropped prone again and clutched vainly at
   the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the
   phosphorescent abyss. Such fury I had not expected, and as I grew aware
   of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss I was beset by a
   thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination. The malignancy of
   the blast awakened incredible fancies; once more I compared myself
   shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful corridor, the
   man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race, for in the fiendish
   clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive
   rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent. I think I
   screamed frantically near the last--I was almost mad--of the howling
   wind-wraiths. I tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent,
   but I could not even hold my own as I was pushed slowly and inexorably
   toward the unknown world. Finally reason must have wholly snapped; for
   I fell babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad
   Arab Alhazred, who dreamed of the nameless city:

     That is not dead which can eternal lie,
     And with strange aeons even death may die.

   Only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place--what
   indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark I endured or what
   Abaddon guided me back to life, where I must always remember and shiver
   in the night wind till oblivion--or worse--claims me. Monstrous,
   unnatural, colossal, was the thing--too far beyond all the ideas of man
   to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours of the morning
   when one cannot sleep.

   I have said that the fury of the rushing blast was
   infernal--cacodaemoniacal--and that its voices were hideous with the
   pent-up viciousness of desolate eternities. Presently these voices,
   while still chaotic before me, seemed to my beating brain to take
   articulate form behind me; and down there in the grave of unnumbered
   aeon-dead antiquities, leagues below the dawn-lit world of men, I heard
   the ghastly cursing and snarling of strange-tongued fiends. Turning, I
   saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be
   seen against the dusk of the corridor--a nightmare horde of rushing
   devils; hate distorted, grotesquely panoplied, half transparent devils
   of a race no man might mistake--the crawling reptiles of the nameless
   city.

   And as the wind died away I was plunged into the ghoul-pooled darkness
   of earth's bowels; for behind the last of the creatures the great
   brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose
   reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun
   as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile.

   1364031The Night Oceanby R. H. Barlow and H. P. Lovecraft1936

   I went to Ellston Beach not only for the pleasures of sun and ocean,
   but to rest a weary mind. Since I knew no person in the little town,
   which thrives on summer vacationists and presents only blank windows
   during most of the year, there seemed no likelihood that I might be
   disturbed. This pleased me, for I did not wish to see anything but the
   expanse of pounding surf and the beach lying before my temporary home.

   My long work of the summer was completed when I left the city, and the
   large mural design produced by it had been entered in the contest. It
   had taken me the bulk of the year to finish the painting, and when the
   last brush was cleaned I was no longer reluctant to yield to the claims
   of health and find rest and seclusion for a time. Indeed, when I had
   been a week on the beach I recalled only now and then the work whose
   success had so recently seemed all-important. There was no longer the
   old concern with a hundred complexities of colour and ornament; no
   longer the fear and mistrust of my ability to render a mental image
   actual, and turn by my own skill alone the dim-conceived idea into the
   careful draught of a design. And yet that which later befell me by the
   lonely shore may have grown solely from the mental constitution behind
   such concern and fear and mistrust. For I have always been a seeker, a
   dreamer, and a ponderer on seeking and dreaming; and who can say that
   such a nature does not open latent eyes sensitive to unsuspected worlds
   and orders of being?

   Now that I am trying to tell what I saw I am conscious of a thousand
   maddening limitations. Things seen by the inward sight, like those
   flashing visions which come as we drift into the blankness of sleep,
   are more vivid and meaningful to us in that form than when we have
   sought to weld them with reality. Set a pen to a dream, and the colour
   drains from it. The ink with which we write seems diluted with
   something holding too much of reality, and we find that after all we
   cannot delineate the incredible memory. It is as if our inward selves,
   released from the bonds of daytime and objectivity, revelled in
   prisoned emotions which are hastily stifled when we would translate
   them. In dreams and visions lie the greatest creations of man, for on
   them rests no yoke of line or hue. Forgotten scenes, and lands more
   obscure than the golden world of childhood, spring into the sleeping
   mind to reign until awakening puts them to rout. Amid these may be
   attained something of the glory and contentment for which we yearn;
   some adumbration of sharp beauties suspected but not before revealed,
   which are to us as the Grail to holy spirits of the mediaeval world. To
   shape these things on the wheel of art, to seek to bring some faded
   trophy from that intangible realm of shadow and gossamer, requires
   equal skill and memory. For although dreams are in all of us, few hands
   may grasp their moth-wings without tearing them.

   Such skill this narrative does not have. If I might, I would reveal to
   you the hinted events which I perceived dimly, like one who peers into
   an unlit realm and glimpses forms whose motion is concealed. In my
   mural design, which then lay with a multitude of others in the building
   for which they were planned, I had striven equally to catch a trace of
   this elusive shadow-world, and had perhaps succeeded better than I
   shall now succeed. My stay in Ellston was to await the judging of that
   design; and when days of unfamiliar leisure had given me perspective, I
   discovered that--in spite of those weaknesses which a creator always
   detects most clearly--I had indeed managed to retain in line and colour
   some fragments snatched from the endless world of imagining. The
   difficulties of the process, and the resulting strain on all my powers,
   had undermined my health and brought me to the beach during this period
   of waiting.

   Since I wished to be wholly alone, I rented (to the delight of the
   incredulous owner) a small house some distance from the village of
   Ellston--which, because of the waning season, was alive with a moribund
   bustle of tourists, uniformly uninteresting to me. The house, dark from
   the sea-wind though it had not been painted, was not even a satellite
   of the village; but swung below it on the coast like a pendulum beneath
   a still clock, quite alone upon a hill of weed-grown sand. Like a
   solitary warm animal it crouched facing the sea, and its inscrutable
   dirty windows stared upon a lonely realm of earth and sky and enormous
   sea. It will not do to use too much imagining in a narrative whose
   facts, could they be augmented and fitted into a mosaic, would be
   strange enough in themselves; but I thought the little house was lonely
   when I saw it, and that like myself, it was conscious of its
   meaningless nature before the great sea.

   I took the place in late August, arriving a day before I was expected,
   and encountering a van and two workingmen unloading the furniture
   provided by the owner. I did not know then how long I would stay, and
   when the truck that brought the goods had left I settled my small
   luggage and locked the door (feeling very proprietary about having a
   house after months of a rented room) to go down the weedy hill and on
   the beach. Since it was quite square and had but one room, the house
   required little exploration. Two windows in each side provided a great
   quantity of light, and somehow a door had been squeezed in as an
   afterthought on the oceanward wall. The place had been built about ten
   years previously, but on account of its distance from Ellston village
   was difficult to rent even during the active summer season. There being
   no fireplace, it stood empty and alone from October until far into
   spring. Though actually less than a mile below Ellston, it seemed more
   remote; since a bend in the coast caused one to see only grassy dunes
   in the direction of the village.

   The first day, half-gone when I was installed, I spent in the enjoyment
   of sun and restless water--things whose quiet majesty made the
   designing of murals seem distant and tiresome. But this was the natural
   reaction to a long concern with one set of habits and activities. I was
   through with my work and my vacation was begun. This fact, while
   elusive for the moment, showed in everything which surrounded me that
   afternoon of my arrival; and in the utter change from old scenes. There
   was an effect of bright sun upon a shifting sea of waves whose
   mysteriously impelled curves were strewn with what appeared to be
   rhinestones. Perhaps a watercolour might have caught the solid masses
   of intolerable light which lay upon the beach where the sea mingled
   with the sand. Although the ocean bore her own hue, it was dominated
   wholly and incredibly by the enormous glare. There was no other person
   near me, and I enjoyed the spectacle without the annoyance of any alien
   object upon the stage. Each of my senses was touched in a different
   way, but sometimes it seemed that the roar of the sea was akin to that
   great brightness, or as if the waves were glaring instead of the sun,
   each of these being so vigorous and insistent that impressions coming
   from them were mingled. Curiously, I saw no one bathing near my little
   square house during that or succeeding afternoons, although the curving
   shore included a wide beach even more inviting than that at the
   village, where the surf was dotted with random figures. I supposed that
   this was because of the distance and because there had never been other
   houses below the town. Why this unbuilt stretch existed, I could not
   imagine; since many dwellings straggled along the northward coast,
   facing the sea with aimless eyes.

   I swam until the afternoon had gone, and later, having rested, walked
   into the little town. Darkness hid the sea from me as I entered, and I
   found in the dingy lights of the streets tokens of a life which was not
   even conscious of the great, gloom-shrouded thing lying so close. There
   were painted women in tinsel adornments, and bored men who were no
   longer young--a throng of foolish marionettes perched on the lip of the
   ocean-chasm; unseeing, unwilling to see what lay above them and about,
   in the multitudinous grandeur of the stars and the leagues of the night
   ocean. I walked along that darkened sea as I went back to the bare
   little house, sending the beams of my flashlight out upon the naked and
   impenetrable void. In the absence of the moon, this light made a solid
   bar athwart the walls of the uneasy tide; and I felt an indescribable
   emotion born of the noise of the waters and the perception of my
   inconceivable smallness as I cast that tiny beam upon a realm immense
   in itself, yet only the black border of the earthly deep. That nighted
   deep, upon which ships were moving alone in the darkness where I could
   not see them, gave off the murmur of a distant, angry rabble. When I
   reached my high residence I knew that I had passed no one during the
   mile's walk from the village, and yet there somehow lingered an
   impression that I had been all the while accompanied by the spirit of
   the lonely sea. It was, I thought, personified in a shape which was not
   revealed to me, but which moved quietly about beyond my range of
   comprehension. It was like those actors who wait behind darkened
   scenery in readiness for the lines which will shortly call them before
   our eyes to move and speak in the sudden revelation of the footlights.
   At last I shook off this fancy and sought my key to enter the place,
   whose bare walls gave a sudden feeling of security.

   My cottage was entirely free of the village, as if it had wandered down
   the coast and was unable to return; and there I heard nothing of the
   disturbing clamour when I returned each night after supper. I generally
   stayed but a short while upon the streets of Ellston, though sometimes
   I went into the place for the sake of the walk it provided. There were
   all the multitude of curio-shops and falsely regal theater-fronts that
   clutter vacation towns, but I never went into these; and the place
   seemed useful only for its restaurants. It was astonishing the number
   of useless things people found to do. There was a succession of
   sun-filled days at first. I rose early, and beheld the grey sky agleam
   with promise of sunrise; a prophecy fulfilled as I stood witness. Those
   dawns were cold, and their colours faint in comparison to that uniform
   radiance of day which gives to every hour the quality of white noon.
   That great light, so apparent the first day, made each succeeding day a
   yellow page in the book of time. I noticed that many of the
   beach-people were displeased by the inordinate sun, whereas I sought
   it. After grey months of toil the lethargy induced by a physical
   existence in a region governed by the simple things--the wind and light
   and water--had a prompt effect upon me; and since I was anxious to
   continue this healing process, I spent all my time outdoors in the
   sunlight. This induced a state at once impassive and submissive, and
   gave me a feeling of security against the ravenous night. As darkness
   is akin to death, so is light to vitality. Through the heritage of a
   million years ago, when men were closer to the mother sea, and when the
   creatures of which we are born lay languid in the shallow, sun-pierced
   water, we still seek the primal things when we are tired, steeping
   ourselves within their lulling security like those early half-mammals
   which had not yet ventured upon the oozy land.

   The monotony of the waves gave repose, and I had no other occupation
   than witnessing a myriad ocean moods. There is a ceaseless change in
   the waters--colours and shades pass over them like the insubstantial
   expressions of a well-known face; and these are at once communicated to
   us by half-recognized senses. When the sea is restless, remembering old
   ships that have gone over her chasms, there comes up silently in our
   hearts the longing for a vanished horizon. But when she forgets, we
   forget also. Though we know her a lifetime, she must always hold an
   alien air, as if something too vast to have shape were lurking in the
   universe to which she is a door. The morning ocean, glimmering with a
   reflected mist of blue-white cloud and expanding diamond foam, has the
   eyes of one who ponders on strange things, and her intricately woven
   webs, through which dart a myriad coloured fishes, hold the air of some
   great idle thing which will arise presently from the hoary immemorial
   chasms and stride upon the land.

   I was content for many days, and glad that I had chosen the lonely
   house which sat like a small beast upon those rounded cliffs of sand.
   Among the pleasantly aimless amusements fostered by such a life, I took
   to following the edge of the tide (where the waves left a damp
   irregular outline rimmed with evanescent foam) for long distances; and
   sometimes I found curious bits of shell in the chance litter of the
   sea. There was an astonishing lot of debris on that inward-curving
   coast which my bare little house overlooked, and I judged that currents
   whose courses diverge from the village beach must reach that spot. At
   any rate, my pockets--when I had any--generally held vast stores of
   trash; most of which I threw away an hour or two after picking it up,
   wondering why I had kept it. Once, however, I found a small bone whose
   nature I could not identify, save that it was certainly nothing out of
   a fish; and I kept this, along with a large metal bead whose minutely
   carven design was rather unusual. This latter depicted a fishy thing
   against a patterned background of seaweed instead of the usual floral
   or geometrical designs, and was still clearly traceable though worn
   with years of tossing in the surf. Since I had never seen anything like
   it, I judged that it represented some fashion, now forgotten, of a
   previous year at Ellston, where similar fads were common.

   I had been there perhaps a week when the weather began a gradual
   change. Each stage of this progressive darkening was followed by
   another subtly intensified, so that in the end the entire atmosphere
   surrounding me had shifted from day to evening. This was more obvious
   to me in a series of mental impressions than in what I actually
   witnessed, for the small house was lonely under the grey skies, and
   there was sometimes a beating wind that came out of the ocean bearing
   moisture. The sun was displaced by long intervals of cloudiness--layers
   of grey mist beyond whose unknown depth the sun lay cut off. Though it
   might glare with the old intensity above that enormous veil, it could
   not penetrate. The beach was a prisoner in a hueless vault for hours at
   a time, as if something of the night were welling into other hours.

   Although the wind was invigorating and the ocean whipped into little
   churning spirals of activity by the vagrant flapping, I found the water
   growing chill, so that I could not stay in it as long as I had done
   previously, and thus I fell into the habit of long walks, which--when I
   was unable to swim--provided the exercise that I was so careful to
   obtain. These walks covered a greater range of sea-edge than my
   previous wanderings, and since the beach extended in a stretch of miles
   beyond the tawdry village, I often found myself wholly isolated upon an
   endless area of sand as evening drew close. When this occurred, I would
   stride hastily along the whispering sea-border, following the outline
   so that I should not wander inland and lose my way. And sometimes, when
   these walks were late (as they grew increasingly to be) I would come
   upon the crouching house that looked like a harbinger of the village.
   Insecure upon the wind-gnawed cliffs, a dark blot upon the morbid hues
   of the ocean sunset, it was more lonely than by the full light of
   either orb; and seemed to my imagination like a mute, questioning face
   turned toward me expectant of some action. That the place was isolated
   I have said, and this at first pleased me; but in that brief evening
   hour when the sun left a gore-splattered decline and darkness lumbered
   on like an expanding shapeless blot, there was an alien presence about
   the place: a spirit, a mood, an impression that came from the surging
   wind, the gigantic sky, and that sea which drooled blackening waves
   upon a beach grown abruptly strange. At these times I felt an
   uneasiness which had no very definite cause, although my solitary
   nature had made me long accustomed to the ancient silence and the
   ancient voice of nature. These misgivings, to which I could have put no
   sure name, did not affect me long, yet I think now that all the while a
   gradual consciousness of the ocean's immense loneliness crept upon me,
   a loneliness that was made subtly horrible by intimations--which were
   never more than such--of some animation or sentience preventing me from
   being wholly alone.

   The noisy, yellow streets of the town, with their curiously unreal
   activity, were very far away, and when I went there for my evening meal
   (mistrusting a diet entirely of my own ambiguous cooking) I took
   increasing and quite unreasonable care that I should return to the
   cottage before the late darkness, although I was often abroad until ten
   or so.

   You will say that such action is unreasonable; that if I had feared the
   darkness in some childish way, I would have entirely avoided it. You
   will ask me why I did not leave the place since its loneliness was
   depressing me. To all this I have no reply, save that whatever unrest I
   felt, whatever of remote disturbance there was to me in brief aspects
   of the darkening sun or in the eager salt-brittle wind or in the robe
   of the dark sea that lay crumpled like an enormous garment so close to
   me, was something which had an origin half in my own heart, which
   showed itself only at fleeting moments, and which had no very long
   effect upon me. In the recurrent days of diamond light, with sportive
   waves flinging blue peaks at the basking shore, the memory of dark
   moods seemed rather incredible, yet only an hour or two afterward I
   might again experience those moods, and descend to a dim region of
   despair. Perhaps these inward emotions were only a reflection of the
   sea's own mood; for although half of what we see is coloured by the
   interpretation placed upon it by our minds, many of our feelings are
   shaped quite distinctly by external, physical things. The sea can bind
   us to her many moods, whispering to us by the subtle token of a shadow
   or a gleam upon the waves, and hinting in these ways of her
   mournfulness or rejoicing. Always, she is remembering old things, and
   these memories, though we may not grasp them, are imparted to us, so
   that we share her gaiety or remorse. Since I was doing no work, seeing
   no person that I knew, I was perhaps susceptible to shades of her
   cryptic meaning which would have been overlooked by another. The ocean
   ruled my life during the whole of that late summer; demanding it as
   recompense for the healing she had brought me.

   There were drownings at the beach that year, and while I heard of these
   only casually (such is our indifference to a death which does not
   concern us, and to which we are not witness), I knew that their details
   were unsavoury. The people who died--some of them swimmers of a skill
   beyond the average--were sometimes not found until many days had
   elapsed, and the hideous vengeance of the deep had scourged their
   rotten bodies. It was as if the sea had dragged them into a chasm-lair
   and had mulled them about in the darkness until, satisfied that they
   were no longer of any use, she had floated them ashore in a ghastly
   state. No one seemed to know what had caused these deaths. Their
   frequency excited alarm among the timid, since the undertow at Ellston
   was not strong, and since there were known to be no sharks at hand.
   Whether the bodies showed marks of any attacks I did not learn, but the
   dread of a death which moves among the waves and comes on lone people
   from a lightless, motionless place is a dread which men know and do not
   like. They must quickly find a reason for such a death, even if there
   are no sharks. Since sharks formed only a suspected cause, and one
   never to my knowledge confirmed, the swimmers who continued during the
   rest of the season were on guard against treacherous tides rather than
   against any possible sea-animal. Autumn, indeed, was not a great
   distance off, and some people used this as an excuse for leaving the
   sea, where men were snared by death, and going to the security of
   inland fields, where one cannot even hear the ocean. So August ended,
   and I had been at the beach many days.

   There had been a threat of a storm since the fourth of the new month,
   and on the sixth, when I set out for a walk in the damp wind, there was
   a mass of formless cloud, colourless and oppressive, above the ruffled
   leaden sea. The motion of the wind, directed toward no especial goal
   but stirring uneasily, provided a sensation of coming animation--a hint
   of life in the elements which might be the long-expected storm. I had
   eaten my luncheon at Ellston, and though the heavens seemed the closing
   lid of a great casket, I ventured far down the beach and away from both
   the town and my no-longer-to-be-seen house. As the universal grey
   became spotted with a carrion purple--curiously brilliant despite its
   sombre hue--I found that I was several miles from any possible shelter.
   This, however, did not seem very important; for despite the dark skies
   with their added glow of unknown presage I was in a curious mood of
   detachment paralleling that glow--a mood which flashed through a body
   grown suddenly alert and sensitive to the outline of shapes and
   meanings that were previously dim. Obscurely, a memory came to me;
   suggested by the likeness of the scene to one I had imagined when a
   story was read to me in childhood. That tale--of which I had not
   thought for many years--concerned a woman who was loved by the
   dark-bearded king of an underwater realm of blurred cliffs where
   fish-things lived, and who was taken from the golden-haired youth of
   her troth by a dark being crowned with a priest-like mitre and having
   the features of a withered ape. What had remained in the corner of my
   fancy was the image of cliffs beneath the water against the hueless,
   dusky no-sky of such a realm; and this, though I had forgotten most of
   the story, was recalled quite unexpectedly by the same pattern of cliff
   and sky which I then beheld. The sight was similar to what I had
   imagined in a year now lost save for random, incomplete impressions.
   Suggestions of this story may have lingered behind certain irritating
   unfinished memories, and in certain values hinted to my senses by
   scenes whose actual worth was bafflingly small. Frequently, in flashes
   of momentary perception (the conditions more than the object being
   significant), we feel that certain isolated scenes and arrangements--a
   feathery landscape, a woman's dress along the curve of a road by
   afternoon, or the solidity of a century-defying tree against the pale
   morning sky--hold something precious, some golden virtue that we must
   grasp. And yet when such a scene or arrangement is viewed later, or
   from another point, we find that it has lost its value and meaning for
   us. Perhaps this is because the thing we see does not hold that elusive
   quality, but only suggests to the mind some very different thing which
   remains unremembered. The baffled mind, not wholly sensing the cause of
   its flashing appreciation, seizes on the object exciting it, and is
   surprised when there is nothing of worth therein. Thus it was when I
   beheld the purpling clouds. They held the stateliness and mystery of
   old monastery towers at twilight, but their aspect was also that of the
   cliffs in the old fairy-tale. Suddenly reminded of this lost image, I
   half expected to see, in the fine-spun dirty foam and among the waves
   which were now as if they had been poured of flawed black glass, the
   horrid figure of that ape-faced creature, wearing a mitre old with
   verdigris, advancing from its kingdom in some lost gulf to which those
   waves were sky.

   I did not see any such creature from the realm of imagining, but as the
   chill wind veered, slitting the heavens like a rustling knife, there
   lay in the gloom of merging cloud and water only a grey object, like a
   piece of driftwood, tossing obscurely on the foam. This was a
   considerable distance out, and since it vanished shortly, may not have
   been wood, but a porpoise coming to the troubled surface. I soon found
   that I had stayed too long contemplating the rising storm and linking
   my early fancies with its grandeur, for an icy rain began spotting
   down, bringing a more uniform gloom upon a scene already too dark for
   the hour. Hurrying along the grey sand, I felt the impact of cold drops
   upon my back, and before many moments my clothing was soaked
   throughout. At first I had run, put to flight by the colourless drops
   whose pattern hung in long linking strands from an unseen sky, but
   after I saw that refuge was too far to reach in anything like a dry
   state, I slackened my pace, and returned home as if I had walked under
   clear skies. There was not much reason to hurry, although I did not
   idle as upon previous occasions. The constraining wet garments were
   cold upon me; and with the gathering darkness, and the wind that rose
   endlessly from the ocean, I could not repress a shiver. Yet there was,
   beside the discomfort of the precipitous rain, an exhilaration latent
   in the purplish ravelled masses of cloud and the stimulated reactions
   of my body. In a mood half of exultant pleasure from resisting the rain
   (which streamed from me now, and filled my shoes and pockets) and half
   of strange appreciation of those morbid, dominant skies which hovered
   with dark wings above the shifting eternal sea, I tramped along the
   grey corridor of Ellston Beach. More rapidly than I had expected the
   crouching house showed in the oblique, flapping rain, and all the weeds
   of the sand cliff writhed in accompaniment to the frantic wind, as if
   they would uproot themselves to join the far-travelling element. Sea
   and sky had altered not at all, and the scene was that which had
   accompanied me, save that there was now painted upon it the hunching
   roof that seemed to bend from the assailing rain. I hurried up the
   insecure steps, and let myself into a dry room, where, unconsciously
   surprised that I was free of the nagging wind, I stood for a moment
   with water rilling from every inch of me.

   There are two windows in the front of that house, one on each side, and
   these face nearly straight upon the ocean; which I now saw half
   obscured by the combined veils of the rain and of the imminent night.
   From these windows I looked as I dressed myself in a motley array of
   dry garments seized from convenient hangers and from a chair too laden
   to sit upon. I was prisoned on all sides by an unnaturally increased
   dusk which had filtered down at some undefined hour under cover of the
   storm. How long I had been on the reaches of wet grey sand, or what the
   real time was, I could not tell, though a moment's search produced my
   watch--fortunately left behind and thus avoiding the uniform wetness of
   my clothing. I half guessed the hour from the dimly seen hands, which
   were only slightly less indecipherable than the surrounding figures. In
   another moment my sight penetrated the gloom (greater in the house than
   beyond the bleared window) and saw that it was 6:45.

   There had been no one upon the beach as I came in, and naturally I
   expected to see no further swimmers that night. Yet when I looked again
   from the window there appeared surely to be figures blotting the grime
   of the wet evening. I counted three moving about in some
   incomprehensible manner, and close to the house another--which may not
   have been a person, but a wave-ejected log, for the surf was now
   pounding fiercely. I was startled to no little degree, and wondered for
   what purpose those hardy persons stayed out in such a storm. And then I
   thought that perhaps like myself they had been caught unintentionally
   in the rain and had surrendered to the watery gusts. In another moment,
   prompted by a certain civilised hospitality which overcame my love of
   solitude, I stepped to the door and emerged momentarily (at the cost of
   another wetting, for the rain promptly descended upon me in exultant
   fury) on the small porch, gesticulating toward the people. But whether
   they did not see me, or did not understand, they made no returning
   signal. Dim in the evening, they stood as if half-surprised, or as if
   they awaited some other action from me. There was in their attitude
   something of that cryptic blankness, signifying anything or nothing,
   which the house wore about itself as seen in the morbid sunset.
   Abruptly there came to me a feeling that a sinister quality lurked
   about those unmoving figures who chose to stay in the rainy night upon
   a beach deserted by all people, and I closed the door with a surge of
   annoyance which sought all too vainly to disguise a deeper emotion of
   fear; a consuming fright that welled up from the shadows of my
   consciousness. A moment later, when I had stepped to the window, there
   seemed to be nothing outside but the portentous night. Vaguely puzzled,
   and even more vaguely frightened--like one who has seen no alarming
   thing, but is apprehensive of what may be found in the dark street he
   is soon compelled to cross--I decided that I had very possibly seen no
   one, and that the murky air had deceived me.

   The aura of isolation about the place increased that night, though just
   out of sight on the northward beach a hundred houses rose in the rainy
   darkness, their light bleared and yellow above streets of polished
   glass, like goblin-eyes reflected in an oily forest pool. Yet because I
   could not see them, or even reach them in bad weather--since I had no
   car nor any way to leave the crouching house except by walking in the
   figure-haunted darkness--I realized quite suddenly that I was, to all
   intents, alone with the dreary sea that rose and subsided unseen,
   unkenned, in the mist. And the voice of the sea had become a hoarse
   groan, like that of something wounded which shifts about before trying
   to rise.

   Fighting away the prevalent gloom with a soiled lamp--for the darkness
   crept in at my windows and sat peering obscurely at me from the corners
   like a patient animal--I prepared my food, since I had no intention of
   going to the village. The hour seemed incredibly advanced, though it
   was not yet nine o'clock when I went to bed. Darkness had come early
   and furtively, and throughout the remainder of my stay lingered
   evasively over each scene and action which I beheld. Something had
   settled out of the night--something forever undefined, but stirring a
   latent sense within me, so that I was like a beast expecting the
   momentary rustle of an enemy.

   There were hours of wind, and sheets of the downpour flapped endlessly
   on the meagre walls barring it from me. Lulls came in which I heard the
   mumbling sea, and I could guess that large formless waves jostled one
   another in the pallid whine of the winds, and flung on the beach a
   spray bitter with salt. Yet in the very monotony of the restless
   elements I found a lethargic note, a sound that beguiled me, after a
   time, into slumber grey and colourless as the night. The sea continued
   its mad monologue, and the wind her nagging, but these were shut out by
   the walls of unconsciousness, and for a time the night ocean was
   banished from a sleeping mind.

   Morning brought an enfeebled sun--a sun like that which men will see
   when the earth is old, if there are any men left: a sun more weary than
   the shrouded, moribund sky. Faint echo of its old image, Phoebus strove
   to pierce the ragged, ambiguous clouds as I awoke, at moments sending a
   wash of pale gold rippling across the northwestern interior of my
   house, at others waning till it was only a luminous ball, like some
   incredible plaything forgotten on the celestial lawn. After a while the
   falling rain--which must have continued throughout the previous
   night--succeeded in washing away those vestiges of purple cloud which
   had been like the ocean-cliffs in an old fairy-tale. Cheated alike of
   the setting and rising sun, that day merged with the day before, as if
   the intervening storm had not ushered a long darkness into the world,
   but had swollen and subsided into one long afternoon. Gaining heart,
   the furtive sun exerted all his force in dispelling the old mist,
   streaked now like a dirty window, and cast it from his realm. The
   shallow blue day advanced as those grimy wisps retreated, and the
   loneliness which had encircled me welled back into a watchful place of
   retreat, whence it went no farther, but crouched and waited.

   The ancient brightness was now once more upon the sun, and the old
   glitter on the waves, whose playful blue shapes had flocked upon that
   coast ere man was born, and would rejoice unseen when he was forgotten
   in the sepulchre of time. Influenced by these thin assurances, like one
   who believes the smile of friendship on an enemy's features, I opened
   my door, and as it swung outward, a black spot upon the inward burst of
   light, I saw the beach washed clean of any track, as if no foot before
   mine had disturbed the smooth sand. With the quick lift of spirit that
   follows a period of uneasy depression, I felt--in a purely yielding
   fashion and without volition--that my own memory was washed clean of
   all the mistrust and suspicion and disease-like fear of a lifetime,
   just as the filth of the water's edge succumbs to a particularly high
   tide, and is carried out of sight. There was a scent of soaked,
   brackish grass, like the mouldy pages of a book, commingled with a
   sweet odour born of the hot sunlight upon inland meadows, and these
   were borne into me like an exhilarating drink, seeping and tingling
   through my veins as if they would convey to me something of their own
   impalpable nature, and float me dizzily in the aimless breeze. And
   conspiring with these things, the sun continued to shower upon me, like
   the rain of yesterday, an incessant array of bright spears; as if it
   also wished to hide that suspected background presence which moved
   beyond my sight and was betrayed only by a careless rustle on the
   borders of my consciousness, or by the aspect of blank figures staring
   out of an ocean void. That sun, a fierce ball solitary in the whirlpool
   of infinity, was like a horde of golden moths against my upturned face.
   A bubbling white grail of fire divine and incomprehensible, it withheld
   from me a thousand promised mirages where it granted one. For the sun
   did actually seem to indicate realms, secure and fanciful, where if I
   but knew the path I might wander in this curious exultation. Such
   things come of our own natures, for life has never yielded for one
   moment her secrets; and it is only in our interpretation of their
   hinted images that we may find ecstasy or dullness, according to a
   deliberately induced mood. Yet ever and again we must succumb to her
   deceptions, believing for the moment that we may this time find the
   withheld joy. And in this way the fresh sweetness of the wind, on a
   morning following the haunted darkness (whose evil intimations had
   given me a greater uneasiness than any menace to my body), whispered to
   me of ancient mysteries only half-linked with earth, and of pleasures
   that were the sharper because I felt that I might experience only a
   part of them. The sun and wind and that scent that rose upon them told
   me of festivals of gods whose senses are a millionfold more poignant
   than man's and whose joys are a millionfold more subtle and prolonged.
   These things, they hinted, could be mine if I gave myself wholly into
   their bright deceptive power. And the sun, a crouching god with naked
   celestial flesh, an unknown, too-mighty furnace upon which eye might
   not look, seemed almost sacred in the glow of my newly sharpened
   emotions. The ethereal thunderous light it gave was something before
   which all things must worship astonished. The slinking leopard in his
   green-chasmed forest must have paused briefly to consider its
   leaf-scattered rays, and all things nurtured by it must have cherished
   its bright message on such a day. For when it is absent in the far
   reaches of eternity, earth will be lost and black against an
   illimitable void. That morning, in which I shared the fire of life, and
   whose brief moment of pleasure is secure against the ravenous years,
   was astir with the beckoning of strange things whose elusive names can
   never be written.

   As I made my way toward the village, wondering how it might look after
   a long-needed scrubbing by the industrious rain, I saw, tangled in a
   glimmer of sunlit moisture that was poured over it like a yellow
   vintage, a small object like a hand, some twenty feet ahead of me, and
   touched by the repetitious foam. The shock and disgust born in my
   startled mind when I saw that it was indeed a piece of rotten flesh
   overcame my new contentment and engendered a shocked suspicion that it
   might actually be a hand. Certainly, no fish, or part of one, could
   assume that look, and I thought I saw mushy fingers wed in decay. I
   turned the thing over with my foot, not wishing to touch so foul an
   object, and it adhered stickily to the leather shoe, as if clutching
   with the grasp of corruption. The thing, whose shape was nearly lost,
   held too much resemblance to what I feared it might be; and I pushed it
   into the willing grasp of a seething wave, which took it from sight
   with an alacrity not often shown by those ravelled edges of the sea.
   Perhaps I should have reported my find, yet its nature was too
   ambiguous to make action natural. Since it had been partly eaten by
   some ocean-dwelling monstrousness, I did not think it identifiable
   enough to form evidence of an unknown but possible tragedy. The
   numerous drownings, of course, came into my mind--as well as other
   things lacking in wholesomeness, some of which remained only as
   possibilities. Whatever the storm-dislodged fragment may have been, and
   whether it were fish or some animal akin to man, I have never spoken of
   it until now. After all, there was no proof that it had not merely been
   distorted by rottenness into that shape.

   I approached the town, sickened by the presence of such an object
   amidst the apparent beauty of the clean beach, though it was horribly
   typical of the indifference of death in a nature which mingles
   rottenness with beauty, and perhaps loves the former more. In Ellston I
   heard of no recent drowning or other mishap of the sea, and found no
   reference to such in the columns of the local paper--the only one I
   read during my stay. It is difficult to describe the mental state in
   which succeeding days found me. Always susceptible to morbid emotions
   whose dark anguish might be induced by things outside myself, or might
   spring from the abysses of my own spirit, I was ridden by a feeling
   which was not of fear or despair, or anything akin to these, but was
   rather a perception of the brief hideousness and underlying filth of
   life--a feeling partly a reflection of my internal nature and partly a
   result of broodings induced by that gnawed rotten object which may have
   been a hand. In those days my mind was a place of shadowed cliffs and
   dark moving figures, like the ancient unsuspected realm which the
   fairy-tale recalled to me. I felt, in brief agonies of disillusionment,
   the gigantic blackness of this overwhelming universe, in which my days
   and the days of my race were as nothing to the shattered stars; a
   universe in which each action is vain and even the emotion of grief a
   wasted thing. The hours I had previously spent in something of regained
   health, contentment and physical well-being were given now (as if those
   days of the previous week were something definitely ended) to an
   indolence like that of a man who no longer cares to live. I was
   engulfed by a piteous lethargic fear of some ineluctable doom which
   would be, I felt, the completed hate of the peering stars and of the
   black enormous waves that hoped to clasp my bones within them--the
   vengeance of all the indifferent, horrendous majesty of the night
   ocean.

   Something of the darkness and restlessness of the sea had penetrated my
   heart, so that I lived in an unreasoning, unperceiving torment, a
   torment none the less acute because of the subtlety of its origin and
   the strange, unmotivated quality of its vampiric existence. Before my
   eyes lay the phantasmagoria of the purpling clouds, the strange silver
   bauble, the recurrent stagnant foam, the loneliness of that bleak-eyed
   house, and the mockery of the puppet town. I no longer went to the
   village, for it seemed only a travesty of life. Like my own soul, it
   stood upon a dark, enveloping sea--a sea grown slowly hateful to me.
   And among these images, corrupt and festering, dwelt that of an object
   whose human contours left ever smaller the doubt of what it once had
   been.

   These scribbled words can never tell of the hideous loneliness
   (something I did not even wish assuaged, so deeply was it embedded in
   my heart) which had insinuated itself within me, mumbling of terrible
   and unknown things stealthily circling nearer. It was not a madness:
   rather it was a too clear and naked perception of the darkness beyond
   this frail existence, lit by a momentary sun no more secure than
   ourselves: a realization of futility that few can experience and ever
   again touch the life about them: a knowledge that turn as I might,
   battle as I might with all the remaining power of my spirit, I could
   neither win an inch of ground from the inimical universe, nor hold for
   even a moment the life entrusted to me. Fearing death as I did life,
   burdened with a nameless dread yet unwilling to leave the scenes
   evoking it, I awaited whatever consummating horror was shifting itself
   in the immense region beyond the walls of consciousness.

   Thus autumn found me, and what I had gained from the sea was lost back
   into it. Autumn on the beaches--a drear time betokened by no scarlet
   leaf nor any other accustomed sign. A frightening sea which changes
   not, though man changes. There was only a chilling of the waters, in
   which I no longer cared to enter--a further darkening of the pall-like
   sky, as if eternities of snow were waiting to descend upon the ghastly
   waves. Once that descent began, it would never cease, but would
   continue beneath the white and the yellow and the crimson sun and
   beneath that ultimate small ruby which shall yield only to the
   futilities of night. The once friendly waters babbled meaningfully at
   me, and eyed me with a strange regard; yet whether the darkness of the
   scene were a reflection of my own broodings, or whether the gloom
   within me were caused by what lay without, I could not have told. Upon
   the beach and me alike had fallen a shadow, like that of a bird which
   flies silently overhead--a bird whose watching eyes we do not suspect
   till the image on the ground repeats the image in the sky, and we look
   suddenly upward to find that something has been circling above us
   hitherto unseen. The day was in late September, and the town had closed
   the resorts where mad frivolity ruled empty, fear-haunted lives, and
   where raddled puppets performed their summer antics. The puppets were
   cast aside, smeared with the painted smiles and frowns they had last
   assumed, and there were not a hundred people left in the town. Again
   the gaudy, stucco-fronted buildings lining the shore were permitted to
   crumble undisturbed in the wind. As the month advanced to the day of
   which I speak, there grew in me the light of a grey, infernal dawn,
   wherein I felt some dark thaumaturgy would be completed. Since I feared
   such a thaumaturgy less than a continuance of my horrible
   suspicions--less than the too-elusive hints of something monstrous
   lurking behind the great stage--it was with more speculation than
   actual fear that I waited unendingly for the day of horror which seemed
   to be nearing. The day, I repeat, was late in September, though whether
   the 22nd or 23rd I am uncertain. Such details have fled before the
   recollection of those uncompleted happenings--episodes with which no
   orderly existence should be plagued, because of the damnable
   suggestions (and only suggestions) they contain. I knew the time with
   an intuitive distress of spirit--a recognition too deep for me to
   explain. Throughout those daylight hours I was expectant of the night;
   impatient, perhaps, so that the sunlight passed like a half-glimpsed
   reflection in rippled water--a day of whose events I recall nothing. It
   was long since that portentous storm had cast a shadow over the beach,
   and I had determined, after hesitations caused by nothing tangible, to
   leave Ellston, since the year was chilling and there was no return to
   my earlier contentment. When a telegram came for me (lying two days in
   the Western Union office before I was located, so little was my name
   known) saying that my design had been accepted--winning above all
   others in the contest--I set a date for leaving. This news, which
   earlier in the year would have affected me strongly, I now received
   with a curious apathy. It seemed as unrelated to the unreality about
   me, as little pertinent to me, as if it were directed to another person
   whom I did not know, and whose message had come to me through some
   accident. None the less, it was that which forced me to complete my
   plans and leave the cottage by the shore.

   There were only four nights of my stay remaining when there occurred
   the last of those events whose meaning lies more in the darkly sinister
   impression surrounding them than in anything obviously threatening.
   Night had settled over Ellston and the coast, and a pile of soiled
   dishes attested both to my recent meal and to my lack of industry.
   Darkness came as I sat with a cigarette before the seaward window, and
   it was a liquid which gradually filled the sky, washing in a floating
   moon, monstrously elevated. The flat sea bordering upon the gleaming
   sand, the utter absence of tree or figure or life of any sort, and the
   regard of that high moon made the vastness of my surroundings abruptly
   clear. There were only a few stars pricking through, as if to
   accentuate by their smallness the majesty of the lunar orb and of the
   restless, shifting tide.

   I had stayed indoors, fearing somehow to go out before the sea on such
   a night of shapeless portent, but I heard it mumbling secrets of an
   incredible lore. Borne to me on a wind out of nowhere was the breath of
   some strange and palpitant life--the embodiment of all I had felt and
   of all I had suspected--stirring now in the chasms of the sky or
   beneath the mute waves. In what place this mystery turned from an
   ancient, horrible slumber I could not tell, but like one who stands by
   a figure lost in sleep, knowing that it will awake in a moment, I
   crouched by the windows, holding a nearly burnt-out cigarette, and
   faced the rising moon.

   Gradually there passed into that never-stirring landscape a brilliance
   intensified by the overhead glimmerings, and I seemed more and more
   under some compulsion to watch whatever might follow. The shadows were
   draining from the beach, and I felt that they took with were all which
   might have been a harbour for my thoughts when the hinted thing should
   come. Where any of them did remain they were ebon and blank: still
   lumps of darkness sprawling beneath the cruel brilliant rays. The
   endless tableau of the lunar orb--dead now, whatever her past was, and
   cold as the unhuman sepulchres she bears amid the ruin of dusty
   centuries older than man--and the sea--astir, perhaps, with some
   unkenned life, some forbidden sentience--confronted me with a horrible
   vividness. I arose and shut the window; partly because of an inward
   prompting, but mostly, I think, as an excuse for transferring
   momentarily the stream of thought. No sound came to me now as I stood
   before the closed panes. Minutes or eternities were alike. I was
   waiting, like my own fearing heart and the motionless scene beyond, for
   the token of some ineffable life. I had set the lamp upon a box in the
   western corner of the room, but the moon was brighter, and her bluish
   rays invaded places where the lamplight was faint. The ancient glow of
   the round silent orb lay upon the beach as it had lain for aeons, and I
   waited in a torment of expectancy made doubly acute by the delay in
   fulfillment, and the uncertainty of what strange completion was to
   come.

   Outside the crouching hut a white illumination suggested vague spectral
   forms whose unreal, phantasmal motions seemed to taunt my blindness,
   just as unheard voices mocked my eager listening. For countless moments
   I was still, as if Time and the tolling of her great bell were hushed
   into nothingness. And yet there was nothing which I might fear: the
   moon-chiselled shadows were unnatural in no contour, and veiled nothing
   from my eyes. The night was silent--I knew that despite my closed
   window--and all the stars were fixed mournfully in a listening heaven
   of dark grandeur. No motion from me then, or word now, could reveal my
   plight, or tell of the fear-racked brain imprisoned in flesh which
   dared not break the silence, for all the torture it brought. As if
   expectant of death, and assured that nothing could serve to banish the
   soul-peril I confronted, I crouched with a forgotten cigarette in my
   hand. A silent world gleamed beyond the cheap, dirty windows, and in
   one corner of the room a pair of dirty oars, placed there before my
   arrival, shared the vigil of my spirit. The lamp burned endlessly,
   yielding a sick light hued like a corpse's flesh. Glancing at it now
   and again, for the desperate distraction it gave, I saw that many
   bubbles unaccountably rose and vanished in the kerosene-filled base.
   Curiously enough, there was no heat from the wick. And suddenly I
   became aware that the night as a whole was neither warm nor cold, but
   strangely neutral--as if all physical forces were suspended, and all
   the laws of a calm existence disrupted.

   Then, with an unheard splash which sent from the silver water to the
   shore a line of ripples echoed in fear by my heart, a swimming thing
   emerged beyond the breakers. The figure may have been that of a dog, a
   human being, or something more strange. It could not have known that I
   watched--perhaps it did not care--but like a distorted fish it swam
   across the mirrored stars and dived beneath the surface. After a moment
   it came up again, and this time, since it was closer, I saw that it was
   carrying something across its shoulder. I knew, then, that it could be
   no animal, and that it was a man or something like a man, which came
   toward the land from a dark ocean. But it swam with a horrible ease. As
   I watched, dread-filled and passive, with the fixed stare of one who
   awaits death in another yet knows he cannot avert it, the swimmer
   approached the shore--though too far down the southward beach for me to
   discern its outlines or features. Obscurely loping, with sparks of
   moonlit foam scattered by its quick gait, it emerged and was lost among
   the inland dunes.

   Now I was possessed by a sudden recurrence of fear, which had died away
   in the previous moments. There was a tingling coldness all over
   me--though the room, whose window I dared not open now, was stuffy. I
   thought it would be very horrible if something were to enter a window
   which was not closed. Now that I could no longer see the figure, I felt
   that it lingered somewhere in the close shadows, or peered hideously at
   me from whatever window I did not watch. And so I turned my gaze,
   eagerly and frantically, to each successive pane; dreading that I might
   indeed behold an intrusive regarding face, yet unable to keep myself
   from the terrifying inspection. But though I watched for hours, there
   was no longer anything upon the beach. So the night passed, and with it
   began the ebbing of that strangeness--a strangeness which had surged up
   like an evil brew within a pot, had mounted to the very rim in a
   breathless moment, had paused uncertainly there, and had subsided,
   taking with it whatever unknown message it had borne. Like the stars
   that promise the revelation of terrible and glorious memories, goad us
   into worship by this deception, and then impart nothing. I had come
   frighteningly near to the capture of an old secret which ventured close
   to man's haunts and lurked cautiously just beyond the edge of the
   known. Yet in the end I had nothing, I was given only a glimpse of the
   furtive thing; a glimpse made obscure by the veils of ignorance. I
   cannot even conceive what might have shown itself had I been too close
   to that swimmer who went shoreward instead of into the ocean. I do not
   know what might have come if the brew had passed the rim of the pot and
   poured outward in a swift cascade of revelation. The night ocean
   withheld whatever it had nurtured. I shall know nothing more.

   Even yet I do not know why the ocean holds such a fascination for me.
   But then, perhaps none of us can solve those things--they exist in
   defiance of all explanation. There are men, and wise men, who do not
   like the sea and its lapping surf on yellow shores; and they think us
   strange who love the mystery of the ancient and unending deep. Yet for
   me there is a haunting and inscrutable glamour in all the ocean's
   moods. It is in the melancholy silver foam beneath the moon's waxen
   corpse; it hovers over the silent and eternal waves that beat on naked
   shores; it is there when all is lifeless save for unknown shapes that
   glide through sombre depths. And when I behold the awesome billows
   surging in endless strength, there comes upon me an ecstasy akin to
   fear; so that I must abase myself before this mightiness, that I may
   not hate the clotted waters and their overwhelming beauty. Vast and
   lonely is the ocean, and even as all things came from it, so shall they
   return thereto. In the shrouded depths of time none shall reign upon
   the earth, nor shall any motion be, save in the eternal waters. And
   these shall beat on dark shores in thunderous foam, though none shall
   remain in that dying world to watch the cold light of the enfeebled
   moon playing on the swirling tides and coarse-grained sand. On the
   deep's margin shall rest only a stagnant foam, gathering about the
   shells and bones of perished shapes that dwelt within the waters.
   Silent, flabby things will toss and roll along empty shores, their
   sluggish life extinct. Then all shall be dark, for at last even the
   white moon on the distant waves shall wink out. Nothing shall be left,
   neither above nor below the sombre waters. And until that last
   millennium, as after it, the sea will thunder and toss throughout the
   dismal night.

   1336946The Nightmare LakeH.P. Lovecraft

   There is a lake in distant Zan,
   Beyond the wonted haunts of man,
   Where broods alone in a hideous state
   A spirit dead and desolate;
   A spirit ancient and unholy,
   Heavy with fearsome melancholy,
   Which from the waters dull and dense
   Draws vapors cursed with pestilence.
   Around the banks, a mire of clay,
   Sprawl things offensive in decay,
   And curious birds that reach that shore
   Are seen by mortals nevermore.
   Here shines by day the searing sun
   On glassy wastes beheld by none,
   And here by night pale moonbeams flow
   Into the deeps that yawn below.
   In nightmares only is it told
   What scenes beneath those beams unfold;
   What scenes, too old for human sight,
   Lie sunken there in endless night;
   For in those depths there only pace
   The shadows of a voiceless race.
   One midnight, redolent of ill,
   I saw that lake, asleep and still;
   While in the lurid sky there rode
   A gibbous moon that glow'd and glow'd.
   I saw the stretching marshy shore,
   And the foul things those marshes bore:
   Lizards and snakes convuls'd and dying;
   Ravens and vampires putrefying;
   All these, and hov'ring o'er the dead,
   Narcophagi that on them fed.
   And as the dreadful moon climb'd high,
   Fright'ning the stars from out the sky,
   I saw the lake's dull water glow
   Till sunken things appear'd below.
   There shone unnumber'd fathoms down,
   The tow'rs of a forgotten town;
   The tarnish'd domes and mossy walls;
   Weed-tangled spires and empty halls;
   Deserted fanes and vaults of dread,
   And streets of gold uncoveted.
   These I beheld, and saw beside
   A horde of shapeless shadows glide;
   A noxious horde which to my glance
   Seem'd moving in a hideous dance
   Round slimy sepulchres that lay
   Beside a never-travell'd way.
   Straight from those tombs a heaving rose
   That vex'd the waters' dull repose,
   While lethal shades of upper space
   Howl'd at the moon's sardonic face.
   Then sank the lake within its bed,
   Suck'd down to caverns of the dead,
   Till from the reeking, new-stript earth
   Curl'd foetid fumes of noisome birth.
   About the city, nigh uncover'd,
   The monstrous dancing shadows hover'd,
   When lo! there oped with sudden stir
   The portal of each sepulchre!
   No ear may learn, no tongue may tell
   What nameless horror then befell.
   I see that lake--that moon agrin--
   That city and the things within--
   Waking, I pray that on that shore
   The nightmare lake may sink no more!

The Other Gods

   The Other Gods
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   8518The Other GodsH. P. Lovecraft

   Atop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer
   not man to tell that he hath looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once
   inhabited; but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of
   rock and snow, driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till now
   only the last remains. When they left their old peaks they took with
   them all signs of themselves, save once, it is said, when they left a
   carven image on the face of the mountain which they called Ngranek.

   But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold
   waste where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak
   whereto to flee at the coming of men. They are grown stern, and where
   once they suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come;
   or coming, to depart. It is well for men that they know not of Kadath
   in the cold waste; else they would seek injudiciously to scale it.

   Sometimes when earth's gods are homesick they visit in the still of the
   night the peaks where once they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to
   play in the olden way on remembered slopes. Men have felt the tears of
   the gods on white-capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and
   have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of Lerion.
   In cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters have
   legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is
   cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old.

   In Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man avid
   to behold the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven
   cryptical books of earth, and familiar with the Pnakotic Manuscripts of
   distant and frozen Lomar. His name was Barzai the Wise, and the
   villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange
   eclipse.

   Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and
   goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a
   god himself. It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when
   they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who
   first told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at
   midnight on St. John's Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore of the
   earth's gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their faces. He
   believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from
   their wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky
   Hatheg-Kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there.

   Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is
   named, and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its peak
   the mists play always mournfully, for mists are the memories of the
   gods, and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the old
   days. Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of
   clouds, casting pale vapors over the slopes as they dance reminiscently
   on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers of Hatheg say it is ill
   to climb the Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night
   when pale vapors hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them
   not when he came from neighboring Ulthar with the young priest Atal,
   who was his disciple. Atal was only the son of an innkeeper, and was
   sometimes afraid; but Barzai's father had been a landgrave who dwelt in
   an ancient castle, so he had no common superstition in his blood, and
   only laughed at the fearful cotters.

   Barzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the
   prayers of peasants, and talked of earth's gods by their campfires at
   night. Many days they traveled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla with
   his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached the
   mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai was old
   and learned and had no fears, so led the way up the slope that no man
   had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written of with fright in
   the moldy Pnakotic Manuscripts.

   The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling
   stones. Later it grew cold and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often slipped
   and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes. Finally
   the air grew thin, and the sky changed color, and the climbers found it
   hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marveling at the
   strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would
   happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread
   around. For three days they climbed higher and higher toward the roof
   of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon.

   For four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through
   the thin mournful mist around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth
   night, which was the night of the full moon, Barzai saw some dense
   clouds far to the north, and stayed up with Atal to watch them draw
   near. Thick and majestic they sailed, slowly and deliberately onward;
   ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers, and hiding
   the moon and the summit from view. For a long hour the watchers gazed,
   whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and
   more restless. Barzai was wise in the lore of earth's gods, and
   listened hard for certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the
   vapours and the awe of the night, and feared much. And when Barzai
   began to climb higher and beckon eagerly, it was long before Atal would
   follow.

   So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal
   followed at last, he could scarce see the gray shape of Barzai on the
   dim slope above in the clouded moonlight. Barzai forged very far ahead,
   and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than Atal; fearing not
   the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and
   dauntless man, nor pausing at wide black chasms that Atal could scarce
   leap. And so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs, slipping and
   stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of
   bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps.

   Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff
   that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not
   inspired of earth's gods. Atal was far below, and planning what he
   should do when he reached the place, when curiously he noticed that the
   light had grown strong, as if the cloudless peak and moonlit
   meetingplace of the gods were very near. And as he scrambled on toward
   the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any
   he had known before. Then through the high mists he heard the voice of
   Barzai shouting wildly in delight:

   "I have heard the gods. I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry on
   Hatheg-Kla! The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the Prophet!
   The mists are thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see the gods
   dancing wildly on Hatheg-Kla that they loved in youth. The wisdom of
   Barzai hath made him greater than earth's gods, and against his will
   their spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold the gods,
   the proud gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who spurn the sight
   of man!"

   Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to
   the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds. Then he heard Barzai's
   voice grow shriller and louder:

   "The mist is very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the
   voices of earth's gods are high and wild, and they fear the coming of
   Barzai the Wise, who is greater than they... The moon's light flickers,
   as earth's gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing forms of the
   gods that leap and howl in the moonlight... The light is dimmer and the
   gods are afraid..."

   Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in
   all the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for
   though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown
   fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when
   he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the
   moon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the mists
   he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows:

   "The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in
   the sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of
   men or of earth's gods... There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for the
   screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the slopes
   of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am
   plunging... Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of
   earth!"

   And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in
   the dark a loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else
   ever heard save in the Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry
   wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime
   packed into one atrocious moment:

   "The other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard
   the feeble gods of earth!... Look away... Go back... Do not see! Do not
   see! The vengeance of the infinite abysses... That cursed, that
   damnable pit... Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into the sky!"

   And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump
   downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights, there
   resounded on Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the
   good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of Hatheg, Nir and
   Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange
   eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted. And when the moon came
   out at last Atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without
   sight of earth's gods, or of the other gods.

   Now it is told in the moldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found
   naught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb Hatheg-Kla in the
   youth of the world. Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg
   crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of
   Barzai the Wise, they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a
   curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had been
   riven by some titanic chisel. And the symbol was like to one that
   learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the Pnakotic
   Manuscripts which were too ancient to be read. This they found.

   Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever
   be persuaded to pray for his soul's repose. Moreover, to this day the
   people of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night
   when pale vapors hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the
   mists on Hatheg-Kla, earth's gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for
   they know they are safe, and love to come from unknown Kadath in ships
   of clouds and play in the olden way, as they did when earth was new and
   men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places.

   The Outpost
   by H.P. Lovecraft
   1336974The OutpostH.P. Lovecraft

   When evening cools the yellow stream,
         And shadows stalk the jungle's ways,
         Zimbabwe's palace flares ablaze
   For a great King who fears to dream.
   For he alone of all mankind
         Waded the swamp that serpents shun;
         And struggling toward the setting sun,
   Came on the veldt that lies behind.
   No other eyes had vented there
         Since eyes were lent for human sight--
         But there, as sunset turned to night,
   He found the Elder Secret's lair.
   Strange turrets rose beyond the plain,
         And walls and bastions spread around
         The distant domes that fouled the ground
   Like leprous fungi after rain.
   A grudging moon writhed up to shine
         Past leagues where life can have no home;
         And paling far-off tower and dome,
   Shewed each unwindowed and malign.
   Then he who in his boyhood ran
         Through vine-hung ruins free of fear,
         Trembled at what he saw--for here
   Was no dead, ruined seat of man.
   Inhuman shapes, half-seen, half-guessed,
         Half solid and half ether-spawned,
         Seethed down from starless voids that yawned
   In heav'n, to these blank walls of pest.
   And voidward from that pest-mad zone
         Amorphous hordes seethed darkly back,
         Their dim claws laden with the wrack
   Of things that men have dreamed and known.
   The ancient Fishers from Outside--
         Were there not tales the high-priest told,
         Of how they found the worlds of old,
   And took what pelf their fancy spied?
   Their hidden, dread-ringed outposts brood
         Upon a million worlds of space;
         Abhorred by every living race,
   Yet scatheless in their solitude.
   Sweating with fright, the watcher crept
         Back to the swamp that serpents shun,
         So that he lay, by rise of sun,
   Safe in the palace where he slept.
   None saw him leave, or come at dawn,
         Nor does his flesh bear any mark
         Of what he met in that curst dark--
   Yet from his sleep all peace has gone.
   When evening cools the yellow stream,
         And shadows stalk the jungle's ways,
         Zimbabwe's palace flares ablaze,
   For a great King who fears to dream.

   3192The OutsiderH. P. Lovecraft1926

   Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and
   sadness. Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and
   dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique
   books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic,
   and vine-encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far
   aloft. Such a lot the gods gave to me--to me, the dazed, the
   disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I am strangely content
   and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind momentarily
   threatens to reach beyond to the other.

   I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old
   and infinitely horrible, full of dark passages and having high ceilings
   where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the
   crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an
   accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead
   generations. It was never light, so that I used sometimes to light
   candles and gaze steadily at them for relief, nor was there any sun
   outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost
   accessible tower. There was one black tower which reached above the
   trees into the unknown outer sky, but that was partly ruined and could
   not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall,
   stone by stone.

   I must have lived years in this place, but I cannot measure the time.
   Beings must have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person
   except myself, or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and
   spiders. I think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged,
   since my first conception of a living person was that of somebody
   mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the
   castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons
   that strewed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations.
   I fantastically associated these things with everyday events, and
   thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings
   which I found in many of the mouldy books. From such books I learned
   all that I know. No teacher urged or guided me, and I do not recall
   hearing any human voice in all those years--not even my own; for
   although I had read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak
   aloud. My aspect was a matter equally unthought of, for there were no
   mirrors in the castle, and I merely regarded myself by instinct as akin
   to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt
   conscious of youth because I remembered so little.

   Outside, across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees, I would
   often lie and dream for hours about what I read in the books; and would
   longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond
   the endless forests. Once I tried to escape from the forest, but as I
   went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more
   filled with brooding fear; so that I ran frantically back lest I lose
   my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence.

   So through endless twilights I dreamed and waited, though I knew not
   what I waited for. Then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light
   grew so frantic that I could rest no more, and I lifted entreating
   hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest
   into the unknown outer sky. And at last I resolved to scale that tower,
   fall though I might; since it were better to glimpse the sky and
   perish, than to live without ever beholding day.

   In the dank twilight I climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till I
   reached the level where they ceased, and thereafter clung perilously to
   small footholds leading upward. Ghastly and terrible was that dead,
   stairless cylinder of rock; black, ruined, and deserted, and sinister
   with startled bats whose wings made no noise. But more ghastly and
   terrible still was the slowness of my progress; for climb as I might,
   the darkness overhead grew no thinner, and a new chill as of haunted
   and venerable mould assailed me. I shivered as I wondered why I did not
   reach the light, and would have looked down had I dared. I fancied that
   night had come suddenly upon me, and vainly groped with one free hand
   for a window embrasure, that I might peer out and above, and try to
   judge the height I had once attained.

   All at once, after an infinity of awesome, sightless, crawling up that
   concave and desperate precipice, I felt my head touch a solid thing,
   and I knew I must have gained the roof, or at least some kind of floor.
   In the darkness I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding
   it stone and immovable. Then came a deadly circuit of the tower,
   clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my
   testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again,
   pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my
   fearful ascent. There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went
   higher I knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was
   the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater
   circumference than the lower tower, no doubt the floor of some lofty
   and capacious observation chamber. I crawled through carefully, and
   tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place, but
   failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the stone floor I
   heard the eerie echoes of its fall, hoped when necessary to pry it up
   again.

   Believing I was now at prodigious height, far above the accursed
   branches of the wood, I dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled
   about for windows, that I might look for the first time upon the sky,
   and the moon and stars of which I had read. But on every hand I was
   disappointed; since all that I found were vast shelves of marble,
   bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size. More and more I
   reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high
   apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below. Then
   unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of
   stone, rough with strange chiselling. Trying it, I found it locked; but
   with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all obstacles and dragged
   it open inward. As I did so there came to me the purest ecstasy I have
   ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron,
   and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly
   found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had never before seen
   save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories.

   Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I
   commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden
   veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way
   more slowly in the dark. It was still very dark when I reached the
   grating--which I tried carefully and found unlocked, but which I did
   not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which I had
   climbed. Then the moon came out.

   Most demoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and
   grotesquely unbelievable. Nothing I had before undergone could compare
   in terror with what I now saw; with the bizarre marvels that sight
   implied. The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, for it
   was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a
   lofty eminence, there stretched around me on the level through the
   grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked and diversified by
   marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient stone church,
   whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight.

   Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white
   gravel path that stretched away in two directions. My mind, stunned and
   chaotic as it was, still held the frantic craving for light; and not
   even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course. I
   neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or
   magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost.
   I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be;
   though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of
   fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I
   passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and
   wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible
   road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where
   only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road.
   Once I swam across a swift river where crumbling, mossy masonry told of
   a bridge long vanished.

   Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my
   goal, a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park, maddeningly
   familiar, yet full of perplexing strangeness to me. I saw that the moat
   was filled in, and that some of the well-known towers were demolished,
   whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder. But what I observed
   with chief interest and delight were the open windows--gorgeously
   ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry.
   Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an oddly dressed company
   indeed; making merry, and speaking brightly to one another. I had
   never, seemingly, heard human speech before and could guess only
   vaguely what was said. Some of the faces seemed to hold expressions
   that brought up incredibly remote recollections, others were utterly
   alien.

   I now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room,
   stepping as I did so from my single bright moment of hope to my
   blackest convulsion of despair and realization. The nightmare was quick
   to come, for as I entered, there occurred immediately one of the most
   terrifying demonstrations I had ever conceived. Scarcely had I crossed
   the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and
   unheralded fear of hideous intensity, distorting every face and evoking
   the most horrible screams from nearly every throat. Flight was
   universal, and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and
   were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions. Many covered their
   eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race
   to escape, overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before
   they managed to reach one of the many doors.

   The cries were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment
   alone and dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the
   thought of what might be lurking near me unseen. At a casual inspection
   the room seemed deserted, but when I moved towards one of the alcoves I
   thought I detected a presence there--a hint of motion beyond the
   golden-arched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room. As
   I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly;
   and then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered--a ghastly
   ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause--I
   beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable,
   and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance
   changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives.

   I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that
   is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It was the
   ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and dissolution; the putrid,
   dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation, the awful baring of that
   which the merciful earth should always hide. God knows it was not of
   this world--or no longer of this world--yet to my horror I saw in its
   eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty on
   the human shape; and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an
   unspeakable quality that chilled me even more.

   I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort
   towards flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in
   which the nameless, voiceless monster held me. My eyes bewitched by the
   glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them, refused to close;
   though they were mercifully blurred, and showed the terrible object but
   indistinctly after the first shock. I tried to raise my hand to shut
   out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not
   fully obey my will. The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my
   balance; so that I had to stagger forward several steps to avoid
   falling. As I did so I became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the
   nearness of the carrion thing, whose hideous hollow breathing I half
   fancied I could hear. Nearly mad, I found myself yet able to throw out
   a hand to ward off the foetid apparition which pressed so close; when
   in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish
   accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster
   beneath the golden arch.

   I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind
   shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind
   a single fleeting avalanche of soul-annihilating memory. I knew in that
   second all that had been; I remembered beyond the frightful castle and
   the trees, and recognized the altered edifice in which I now stood; I
   recognized, most terrible of all, the unholy abomination that stood
   leering before me as I withdrew my sullied fingers from its own.

   But in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is
   nepenthe. In the supreme horror of that second I forgot what had
   horrified me, and the burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of
   echoing images. In a dream I fled from that haunted and accursed pile,
   and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight. When I returned to the
   churchyard place of marble and went down the steps I found the stone
   trap-door immovable; but I was not sorry, for I had hated the antique
   castle and the trees. Now I ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls
   on the night-wind, and play by day amongst the catacombs of Nephren-Ka
   in the sealed and unknown valley of Hadoth by the Nile. I know that
   light is not for me, save that of the moon over the rock tombs of Neb,
   nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of Nitokris beneath the Great
   Pyramid; yet in my new wildness and freedom I almost welcome the
   bitterness of alienage.

   For although nepenthe has calmed me, I know always that I am an
   outsider; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men.
   This I have known ever since I stretched out my fingers to the
   abomination within that great gilded frame; stretched out my fingers
   and touched a cold and unyielding surface of polished glass.

   The Peace Advocate
   by H. P. Lovecraft

   12312The Peace AdvocateH. P. Lovecraft

   The vicar sat in the firelight's glow,
   A volume in his hand,
   And a tear he shed for the widespread woe,
   And the anguish brought by the vicious foe
   That overran the land.

   But never a hand for his King raised he,
   For he was a man of peace;
   And he car'd not a whit for the victory
   That must come to preserve his nation free,
   And the world from fear release.

   His son had buckled on his sword,
   The first at the front was he.
   But the vicar his valiant child ignor'd
   And his noble deeds in the field deplor'd,
   For he knew not bravery.

   On his flock he strove to fix his will,
   And lead them to scorn the fray.
   He told them that conquest brings but ill;
   That meek submission would serve them still
   To keep the foe away.

   In vain did he hear the bugle's sound
   That strove to avert the fall.
   The land, quoth he, is all men's ground,
   What matter if friend or foe be found
   As master of us all?

   One day from the village green hard by
   The vicar heard a roar
   Of cannon that rival'd the anguish'd cry
   Of the hundreds that liv'd but wish'd to die
   As the enemy rode them o'er.

   Now he sees his own cathedral shake
   At the foemen's wanton aim.
   The ancient towers with the bullets quake;
   The steeples fall, the foundations break,
   And the whole is lost in flame.

   Up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade,
   And the vicar, and daughter, and wife
   Scream out in vain for the needed aid
   That only a regiment might have made
   Ere they lose what is more than life.

   Then quick to his brain came manhood's thought.
   As he saw his erring course,
   And the vicar his dusty rifle brought
   That the foe might at least by one be fought,
   And force repaid with force.

   One shot - the enemy's blasting fire
   A breach in the wall cuts through,
   But the vicar replies with his wakened ire;
   Fells one arm'd brute for each fallen spire,
   And in blood is born anew.

   Two shots - the wife and daughter sink,
   Each with a mortal wound,
   And the vicar, too madden'd by far to think,
   Rushes boldly on to death's vague brink
   With the manhood he has found.

   Three shots - but shots of another kind
   The smoky regions rend.
   And upon the foemen with rage gone blind,
   like a ceaseless, resistless, avenging wind,
   The rescuing troops descend.

   The smoke-pall clears, and the vicar's son
   His father's life has sav'd.
   And the vicar looks o'er ruin done,
   Ere the victory by his child was won,
   His face with care engrav'd.

   The vicar sat in the firelight's glow,
   The volume in his hand
   That brought to his hearth the bitter woe
   Which only a husband and father can know,
   And truly understand.

   With a chasten'd mien he flung the book
   To the leaping flames before,
   And a breath of sad relief he took
   As the pages blacken'd beneath his look -
   The fool of peace no more!

   Epilogue

   The reverend parson, wak'd to man's estate,
   Laments his wife's and daughter's common fate.
   His martial son in warm embrace enfolds,
   And clings the tighter to the child he holds:
   His peaceful notions, banish'd in an hour,
   Will nevermore his wit or sense devour,
   But steep'd in truth, `tis now his nobler plan
   To cure, yet recognize, the faults of man.

   8520The Picture in the HouseH.P. Lovecraft1920

   Searchers after horror haunt strange, far places. For them are the
   catacombs of Ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare
   countries. They climb to the moonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles,
   and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of
   forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted wood and the desolate mountain
   are their shrines, and they linger around the sinister monoliths on
   uninhabited islands. But the true epicure in the terrible, to whom a
   new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and
   justification of existence, esteems most of all the ancient, lonely
   farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the dark elements of
   strength, solitude, grotesqueness and ignorance combine to form the
   perfection of the hideous.

   Most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses
   remote from travelled ways, usually squatted upon some damp grassy
   slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock. Two hundred
   years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have
   crawled and the trees have swelled and spread. They are almost hidden
   now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but
   the small-paned windows still stare shockingly, as if blinking through
   a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of
   unutterable things.

   In such houses have dwelt generations of strange people, whose like the
   world has never seen. Seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which
   exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for
   freedom. There the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free
   from the restrictions of their fellows, but cowered in an appalling
   slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds. Divorced from the
   enlightenment of civilization, the strength of these Puritans turned
   into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self-repression,
   and struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark
   furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern
   heritage. By necessity practical and by philosophy stern, these folks
   were not beautiful in their sins. Erring as all mortals must, they were
   forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that
   they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the
   silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has
   lain hidden since the early days, and they are not communicative, being
   loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes
   one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they
   must often dream.

   It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven
   one afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness
   that any shelter was preferable to exposure. I had been travelling for
   some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of
   certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and
   problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a
   bicycle despite the lateness of the season. Now I found myself upon an
   apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest cut to
   Arkham, overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and
   confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden
   building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge
   leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it is from
   the remnant of a road, this house none the less impressed me
   unfavorably the very moment I espied it. Honest, wholesome structures
   do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my
   genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before
   which biased me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the
   elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to
   wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at
   once so suggestive and secretive.

   I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as
   I approached it I was not so sure, for though the walks were indeed
   overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too
   well to argue complete desertion. Therefore instead of trying the door
   I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain.
   As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a door-step, I
   glanced at the neighboring windows and the panes of the transom above
   me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with
   dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be
   inhabited, despite its isolation and general neglect. However, my
   rapping evoked no response, so after repeating the summons I tried the
   rusty latch and found the door unfastened. Inside was a little
   vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through
   the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odor. I entered,
   carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me. Ahead rose a narrow
   staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar,
   while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the
   ground floor.

   Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and
   crossed into a small low-ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two
   dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible
   way. It appeared to be a kind of sitting-room, for it had a table and
   several chairs, and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique
   clock on a mantel. Books and papers were very few, and in the
   prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the titles. What
   interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every
   visible detail. Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in
   relics of the past, but here the antiquity was curiously complete; for
   in all the room I could not discover a single article of definitely
   post-revolutionary date. Had the furnishings been less humble, the
   place would have been a collector's paradise.

   As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that
   aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house. Just what it
   was that I feared or loathed, I could by no means define; but something
   in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age, of
   unpleasant crudeness, and of secrets which should be forgotten. I felt
   disinclined to sit down, and wandered about examining the various
   articles which I had noticed. The first object of my curiosity was a
   book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an
   antediluvian aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum
   or library. It was bound in leather with metal fittings, and was in an
   excellent state of preservation; being altogether an unusual sort of
   volume to encounter in an abode so lowly. When I opened it to the title
   page my wonder grew even greater, for it proved to be nothing less rare
   than Pigafetta's account of the Congo region, written in Latin from the
   notes of the sailor Lopex and printed at Frankfurt in 1598. I had often
   heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers De
   Bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the
   pages before me. The engravings were indeed interesting, drawn wholly
   from imagination and careless descriptions, and represented negroes
   with white skins and Caucasian features; nor would I soon have closed
   the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired
   nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet. What annoyed me was merely
   the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at
   Plate XII, which represented in gruesome detail a butcher's shop of the
   cannibal Anziques. I experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so
   slight a thing, but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me, especially
   in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of Anzique
   gastronomy.

   I had turned to a neighboring shelf and was examining its meagre
   literary contents - an eighteenth century Bible, a "Pilgrim's Progress"
   of like period, illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the
   almanack-maker Isaiah Thomas, the rotting bulk of Cotton Mather's
   "Magnalia Christi Americana," and a few other books of evidently equal
   age - when my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of
   walking in the room overhead. At first astonished and startled,
   considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I
   immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from
   a sound sleep, and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded
   on the creaking stairs. The tread was heavy, yet seemed to contain a
   curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the more
   because the tread was heavy. When I had entered the room I had shut the
   door behind me. Now, after a moment of silence during which the walker
   may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall, I heard a fumbling at
   the latch and saw the paneled portal swing open again.

   In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should
   have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding. Old,
   white-bearded, and ragged, my host possessed a countenance and physique
   which inspired equal wonder and respect. His height could not have been
   less than six feet, and despite a general air of age and poverty he was
   stout and powerful in proportion. His face, almost hidden by a long
   beard which grew high on the cheeks, seemed abnormally ruddy and less
   wrinkled than one might expect; while over a high forehead fell a shock
   of white hair little thinned by the years. His blue eyes, though a
   trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning. But for his
   horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguished-looking
   as he was impressive. This unkemptness, however, made him offensive
   despite his face and figure. Of what his clothing consisted I could
   hardly tell, for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters
   surmounting a pair of high, heavy boots; and his lack of cleanliness
   surpassed description.

   The appearance of this man, and the instinctive fear he inspired,
   prepared me for something like enmity; so that I almost shuddered
   through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me
   to a chair and addressed me in a thin, weak voice full of fawning
   respect and ingratiating hospitality. His speech was very curious, an
   extreme form of Yankee dialect I had thought long extinct; and I
   studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversation.

   "Ketched in the rain, be ye?" he greeted. "Glad ye was nigh the haouse
   en' hed the sense ta come right in. I calc'late I was alseep, else I'd
   a heerd ye-I ain't as young as I uster be, an' I need a paowerful sight
   o' naps naowadays. Trav'lin fur? I hain't seed many folks 'long this
   rud sence they tuk off the Arkham stage."

   I replied that I was going to Arkham, and apologized for my rude entry
   into his domicile, whereupon he continued.

   "Glad ta see ye, young Sir - new faces is scurce arount here, an' I
   hain't got much ta cheer me up these days. Guess yew hail from Bosting,
   don't ye? I never ben thar, but I kin tell a taown man when I see 'im -
   we hed one fer deestrick schoolmaster in 'eighty-four, but he quit
   suddent an' no one never heerd on 'im sence - " here the old man lapsed
   into a kind of chuckle, and made no explanation when I questioned him.
   He seemed to be in an aboundingly good humor, yet to possess those
   eccentricities which one might guess from his grooming. For some time
   he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality, when it struck me to
   ask him how he came by so rare a book as Pigafetta's "Regnum Congo."
   The effect of this volume had not left me, and I felt a certain
   hesitancy in speaking of it, but curiosity overmastered all the vague
   fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the
   house. To my relief, the question did not seem an awkward one, for the
   old man answered freely and volubly.

   "Oh, that Afriky book? Cap'n Ebenezer Holt traded me thet in
   'sixty-eight - him as was kilt in the war." Something about the name of
   Ebenezer Holt caused me to look up sharply. I had encountered it in my
   genealogical work, but not in any record since the Revolution. I
   wondered if my host could help me in the task at which I was laboring,
   and resolved to ask him about it later on. He continued.

   "Ebenezer was on a Salem merchantman for years, an' picked up a sight
   o' queer stuff in every port. He got this in London, I guess - he uster
   like ter buy things at the shops. I was up ta his haouse onct, on the
   hill, tradin' hosses, when I see this book. I relished the picters, so
   he give it in on a swap. 'Tis a queer book - here, leave me git on my
   spectacles-" The old man fumbled among his rags, producing a pair of
   dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and
   steel bows. Donning these, he reached for the volume on the table and
   turned the pages lovingly.

   "Ebenezer cud read a leetle o' this-'tis Latin - but I can't. I had two
   er three schoolmasters read me a bit, and Passon Clark, him they say
   got draownded in the pond - kin yew make anything outen it?" I told him
   that I could, and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the
   beginning. If I erred, he was not scholar enough to correct me; for he
   seemed childishly pleased at my English version. His proximity was
   becoming rather obnoxious, yet I saw no way to escape without offending
   him. I was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant old man for
   the pictures in a book he could not read, and wondered how much better
   he could read the few books in English which adorned the room. This
   revelation of simplicity removed much of the ill-defined apprehension I
   had felt, and I smiled as my host rambled on:

   "Queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin'. Take this un here near the
   front. Hey yew ever seed trees like thet, with big leaves a floppin'
   over an' daown? And them men - them can't be niggers - they dew beat
   all. Kinder like Injuns, I guess, even ef they be in Afriky. Some o'
   these here critters looks like monkeys, or half monkeys an' half men,
   but I never heerd o' nothin' like this un." Here he pointed to a
   fabulous creature of the artist, which one might describe as a sort of
   dragon with the head of an alligator.

   "But naow I'll show ye the best un - over here nigh the middle - "The
   old man's speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter
   glow; but his fumbling hands, though seemingly clumsier than before,
   were entirely adequate to their mission. The book fell open, almost of
   its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place, to
   the repellent twelfth plate showing a butcher's shop amongst the
   Anzique cannibals. My sense of restlessness returned, though I did not
   exhibit it. The especially bizarre thing was that the artist had made
   his Africans look like white men - the limbs and quarters hanging about
   the walls of the shop were ghastly, while the butcher with his axe was
   hideously incongruous. But my host seemed to relish the view as much as
   I disliked it.

   "What d'ye think o' this - ain't never see the like hereabouts, eh?
   When I see this I telled Eb Holt, 'That's suthin' ta stir ye up an'
   make yer blood tickle.' When I read in Scripter about slayin' - like
   them Midianites was slew - I kinder think things, but I ain't got no
   picter of it. Here a body kin see all they is to it - I s'pose 'tis
   sinful, but ain't we all born an' livin' in sin? - Thet feller bein'
   chopped up gives me a tickle every time I look at 'im - I hey ta keep
   lookin' at 'im - see whar the butcher cut off his feet? Thar's his head
   on thet bench, with one arm side of it, an' t'other arm's on the other
   side o' the meat block."

   As the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his
   hairy, spectacled face became indescribable, but his voice sank rather
   than mounted. My own sensations can scarcely be recorded. All the
   terror I had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly, and
   I knew that I loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me
   with an infinite intensity. His madness, or at least his partial
   perversion, seemed beyond dispute. He was almost whispering now, with a
   huskiness more terrible than a scream, and I trembled as I listened.

   "As I says, 'tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin'. D'ye know, young
   Sir, I'm right sot on this un here. Arter I got the book off Eb I uster
   look at it a lot, especial when I'd heerd Passon Clark rant o' Sundays
   in his big wig. Onct I tried suthin' funny - here, young Sir, don't git
   skeert - all I done was ter look at the picter afore I kilt the sheep
   for market - killin' sheep was kinder more fun arter lookin' at it - "
   The tone of the old man now sank very low, sometimes becoming so faint
   that his words were hardly audible. I listened to the rain, and to the
   rattling of the bleared, small-paned windows, and marked a rumbling of
   approaching thunder quite unusual for the season. Once a terrific flash
   and peal shook the frail house to its foundations, but the whisperer
   seemed not to notice it.

   "Killin' sheep was kinder more fun - but d'ye know, 'twan't quite
   satisfyin'. Queer haow a cravin' gits a holt on ye - As ye love the
   Almighty, young man, don't tell nobody, but I swar ter Gawd thet picter
   begun to make me hungry fer victuals I couldn't raise nor buy - here,
   set still, what's ailin' ye? - I didn't do nothin', only I wondered
   haow 'twud be ef I did - They say meat makes blood an' flesh, an' gives
   ye new life, so I wondered ef 'twudn't make a man live longer an'
   longer ef 'twas more the same - " But the whisperer never continued.
   The interruption was not produced by my fright, nor by the rapidly
   increasing storm amidst whose fury I was presently to open my eyes on a
   smoky solitude of blackened ruins. It was produced by a very simple
   though somewhat unusual happening.

   The open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively
   upward. As the old man whispered the words "more the same" a tiny
   splattering impact was heard, and something showed on the yellowed
   paper of the upturned volume. I thought of the rain and of a leaky
   roof, but rain is not red. On the butcher's shop of the Anzique
   cannibals a small red spattering glistened picturesquely, lending
   vividness to the horror of the engraving. The old man saw it, and
   stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it
   necessary; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he
   had left an hour before. I followed his glance, and beheld just above
   us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot
   of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as I viewed it. I did not
   shriek or move, but merely shut my eyes. A moment later came the
   titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed house of
   unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my
   mind.

   12313The Poe-ets NightmareH. P. Lovecraft

                                   A Fable

                      Luxus tumultus semper causa est.

   Lucullus Languish, student of the skies,
   And connoisseur of rarebits and mince pies,
   A bard by choice, a grocer's clerk by trade,
   (Grown pessimist through honours long delay'd)
   A secret yearning bore, that he might shine
   In breathing numbers, and in song divine.
   Each day his fountain pen was wont to drop
   An ode or dirge or two about the shop,
   Yet naught could strike the chord within his heart
   That throbb'd for poesy, and cry'd for art.
   Each eve he sought his bashful Muse to wake
   With overdoses of ice cream and cake,
   But though th'ambitious youth a dreamer grew,
   Th' Aonian Nymph delcin'd to come to view.

   Something at dusk he scour'd the heav'ns afar
   Searching for raptures in the evening star;
   One night he strove to catch a tale untold
   In crystal deeps - but only caught a cold.
   So pin'd Lucullus with his lofty woe,
   Till one drear day he bought a set of Poe:
   Charm'd with the cheerful horrors there display's,
   He vow'd with gloom to woo the Heav'nly Maid.
   Of Auber's Tarn and Yaanek's slope he dreams,
   And weaves an hundred Ravens in his schemes.
   Not far from our young hero's peaceful home,
   Lies the fair grove wherein he loves to roam.
   Though but a stunted copse in vacant lot,
   He dubs it Temp-e, and adores the spot;
   When shallow puddles dot the wooded plain,
   And brim o'er muddy banks with muddy rain,
   He calls them limpid lakes or poison pools,
   (Depending on which bard his fancy rules.)
   'Tis here he comes with Heliconian fire
   On Sundays when he smites the Attic lyre;
   And here one afternoon he brought his gloom,
   Resolv'd to chant a poet's lay of doom.
   Roget's Thesaurus, and a book of rhymes,
   Provide the rungs whereon his spirit climbs:
   With this grave retinue he trod the grove
   And pray'd the Fauns he might a Poe-et prove.
   But sad to tell, ere Pegasus flew high,
   The not unrelish'd supper hour drew nigh;
   Our tuneful swain th'imperious call attends,
   And soon above the groaning table bends.
   Though it were too prosaic to relate
   Th' exact particulars of what he ate,
   (Such long-drawn lists the hasty reader skips,
   Like Homer's well-known catalogue of ships)
   This much we swear: that as adjournment near'd,
   A monstrous lot of cake had disappear'd!
   Soon to his chamber the young bard repairs,
   And courts soft Somnus with sweet Lydian airs;
   Through open casement scans the star-strown deep,
   And 'neath Orion's beams sinks off to sleep.

   Now start from airy dell the elfin train
   That dance each midnight o'er the sleeping plain,
   To bless the just, or cast a warning spell
   On those who dine not wisely, but too well.
   First Deacon Smith they plague, whose nasal glow
   Comes from what Holmes hath call'd "Elixir Pro";
   Group'd round the couch his visage they deride,
   Whilst through his dreams unnumber'd serpents glide.
   Next troop the little folk into the room
   Where snore our young Endymion, swath'd in gloom:
   A smile lights up his boyish face, whilst he
   Dreams of the moon - or what he ate at tea.
   The chieftain elf th' unconscious youth surveys,
   and on his form a strange enchantment lays:
   Those lips, that lately trill'd with frosted cake,
   Uneasy sounds in slumbrous fashion make;
   At length their owner's fancies they rehearse,
   And lisp this awesome Poe-em in blank verse:

                             Aletheia Phrikodes

                 Omnia risus et omnia pulvis et omnia nihil.

   Demoniac clouds, up-pil'd in chasmy reach
   Of soundless heav'n, smother'd the brooding night;
   Nor came the wonted whisp'rings of the swamp,
   Nor voice of autumn wind along the moor,
   Nor mutter'd noises of th' insomnious grove
   Whose black recesses never saw the sun.
   Within that grove a hideous hollow lies,
   Half bare of trees; a pool in centre lurks
   That none dares sound; a tarn of murky face,
   (Though naught can prove its hue, since light of day,
   Affrighted, shuns the forest-shadow's banks.)
   Hard by, a yawning hillside grotto breathes
   From deeps unvisited, a dull, dank air
   That sears the leaves on certain stunted trees
   Which stand about, clawing the spectral gloom
   With evil boughs. To this accursed dell
   Come woodland creatures, seldom to depart:
   Once I behold, upon a crumbling stone
   Set altar-like before the cave, a thing
   I saw not clearly, yet from glimpsing, fled.
   In this half-dusk I meditate alone
   At many a weary noontide, when without
   A world forgets me in its sun-blest mirth.
   Here howls by night the werewolves, and the souls
   Of those that knew me well in other days.
   Yet on this night the grove spake not to me;
   Nor spake the swamp, nor wind along the moor
   Nor moan'd the wind about the lonely eaves
   Of the bleak, haunted pile wherein I lay.
   I was afraid to sleep, or quench the spark
   Of the low-burning taper by my couch.
   I was afraid when through the vaulted space
   Of the old tow'r, the clock-ticks died away
   Into a silence so profound and chill
   That my teeth chatter'd - giving yet no sound.
   Then flicker'd low the light, and all dissolv'd
   Leaving me floating in the hellish grasp
   Of body'd blackness, from whose beating wings
   Came ghoulish blasts of charnel-scented mist.
   things vague, unseen, unfashion'd, and unnam'd
   Jostled each other in the seething void
   That gap'd, chaotic, downward to a sea
   Of speechless horror, foul with writhing thoughts.
   All this I felt, and felt the mocking eyes
   Of the curs's universe upon my soul;
   Yet naught I saw nor heard, till flash'd a beam
   Of lurid lustre through the rotting heav'ns,
   Playing on scenes I labour'd not to see.
   Methought the nameless tarn, alight at last,
   Reflected shapes, and more reveal'd within
   Those shocking depths that ne'er were seen before;
   Methought from out the cave a demon train,
   Grinning and smirking, reel'd in fiendish rout;
   Bearing within their reeking paws a load
   Of carrion viands for an impious feast.
   Methought the stunted trees with hungry arms
   Grop'd greedily for things I dare not name;
   The while a stifling, wraith-like noisomeness
   Fill'd all the dale, and spoke a larger life
   Of uncorporeal hideousness awake
   In the half-sentient wholeness of the spot.
   Now glow'd the ground, and tarn, and cave, and trees,
   And moving forms, and things not spoken of,
   With such a phosphorescence as men glimpse
   In the putrescent thickets of the swamp
   Where logs decaying lie, and rankness reigns.
   Methought a fire-mist drap'd with lucent fold
   The well-remember'd features of the grove,
   Whilst whirling ether bore in eddying streams
   The hot, unfinish'd stuff of nascent worlds
   Hither and thither through infinity
   Of light and darkness, strangely intermix'd;
   Wherein all entity had consciousness,
   Without th' accustom'd outward shape of life.
   Of these swift circling currents was my soul,
   Free from the flesh, a true constituent part;
   Nor felt I less myself, for want of form.
   Then clear'd the mist, and o'er a star-strown scene
   Divine and measureless, I gaz'd in awe.
   Alone in space, I view'd a feeble fleck
   Of silvern light, marking the narrow ken
   Which mortals call the boundless universe.
   On ev'ry side, each as a tiny star,
   Shone more creations, vaster than our own,
   And teeming with unnumber'd forms of life;
   Though we as life would recognize it not,
   Being bound to earthy thoughts of human mould.
   As on a moonless night the Milky Way
   In solid sheen displays its countless orbs
   To weak terrestrial eyes, each orb a sun;
   So beam'd the prospect on my wond'ring soul;
   A spangled curtain, rich with twinkling gems,
   Yet each a mighty universe of suns.
   But as I gaz'd, I sens'd a spirit voice
   In speech didactic, though no voice it was,
   Save as it carried thought. It bade me mark
   That all the universes in my view
   Form'd but an atom in infinity;
   Whose reaches pass the ether-laden realms
   Of heat and light, extending to far fields
   Where flourish worlds invisible and vague,
   Fill'd with strange wisdom and uncanny life,
   And yet beyond; to myriad spheres of light,
   To spheres of darkness, to abysmal voids
   That know the pulses of disorder'd force.
   Big with these musings, I survey'd the surge
   Of boundless being, yet I us'd not eyes,
   For spirit leans not on the props of sense.
   The docent presence swell'd my strength of soul;
   All things I knew, but knew with mind alone.
   Time's endless vista spread before my thought
   With its vast pageant of unceasing change
   And sempiternal strife of force and will;
   I saw the ages flow in stately stream
   Past rise and fall of universe and life;
   I saw the birth of suns and worlds, their death,
   Their transmutation into limpid flame,
   Their second birth and second death, their course
   Perpetual through the aeons' termless flight,
   Never the same, yet born again to serve
   The varying purpose of omnipotence.
   And whilst I watch'd, I knew each second's space
   Was greater than the lifetime of our world.
   Then turn'd my musings to that speck of dust
   Whereon my form corporeal took its rise;
   That speck, born but a second, which must die
   In one brief second more; that fragile earth;
   That crude experiment; that cosmic sport
   Which holds our proud, aspiring race of mites
   And moral vermin; those presuming mites
   Whom ignorance with empty pomp adorns,
   And misinstructs in specious dignity;
   Those mites who, reas'ning outward, vaunt themselves
   As the chief work of Nature, and enjoy
   In fatuous fancy the particular care
   Of all her mystic, super-regnant pow'r.
   And as I strove to vision the sad sphere
   Which lurk'd, lost in ethereal vortices;
   Methough my soul, tun'd to the infinite,
   Refus'd to glimpse that poor atomic blight;
   That misbegotten accident of space;
   That globe of insignificance, whereon
   (My guide celestial told me) dwells no part
   Of empyreal virtue, but where breed
   The coarse corruptions of divine disease;
   The fest'ring ailments of infinity;
   The morbid matter by itself call'd man:
   Such matter (said my guide) as oft breaks forth
   On broad Creation's fabric, to annoy
   For a brief instant, ere assuaging death
   Heal up the malady its birth provok'd.
   Sicken'd, I turn'd my heavy thoughts away.
   Then spake th' ethereal guide with mocking mien,
   Upbraiding me for searching after Truth;
   Visiting on my mind the searing scorn
   Of mind superior; laughing at the woe
   Which rent the vital essence of my soul.
   Methought he brought remembrance of the time
   When from my fellows to the grove I stray'd,
   In solitude and dusk to meditate
   On things forbidden, and to pierce the veil
   Of seeming good and seeming beauteousness
   That covers o'er the tragedy of Truth,
   Helping mankind forget his sorry lot,
   And raising Hope where Truth would crush it down.
   He spake, and as he ceas'd, methought the flames
   Of fuming Heav'n revolv'd in torments dire;
   Whirling in maelstroms of revellious might,
   Yet ever bound by laws I fathom'd not.
   Cycles and epicycles of such girth
   That each a cosmos seem'd, dazzled my gaze
   Till all a wild phantasmal flow became.
   Now burst athwart the fulgent formlessness
   A rift of purer sheen, a sight supernal,
   Broader that all the void conceiv'd by man,
   Yet narrow here. A glimpse of heav'ns beyond;
   Of weird creations so remote and great
   That ev'n my guide assum'd a tone of awe.
   Borne on the wings of stark immensity,
   A touch of rhythm celestial reach'd my soul;
   Thrilling me more with horror than with joy.
   Again the spirit mock'd my human pangs,
   And deep revil'd me for presumptuous thoughts;
   Yet changing now his mien, he bade me scan
   The wid'ning rift that clave the walls of space;
   He bade me search it for the ultimate;
   He bade me find the truth I sought so long;
   He bade me brave th' unutterable Thing,
   The final Truth of moving entity.
   All this he bade and offer'd - but my soul,
   Clinging to life, fled without aim or knowledge,
   Shrieking in silence through the gibbering deeps.

                                 * * * * * *

   Thus shriek'd the young Lucullus, as he fled
   Through gibbering deeps - and tumbled out of bed;
   Within the room the morning sunshine gleams,
   Whilst the poor youth recalls his troubled dreams.
   He feels his aching limbs, whose woeful pain
   Informs his soul his body lives again,
   And thanks his stars - or cosmoses - or such -
   That he survives the noxious nightmare's clutch.
   Thrill'd with the music of th' eternal spheres,
   (Or is it the alarm-clock that he hears?)
   He vows to all the Pantheon, high and low,
   No more to feed on cake, or pie, or Poe.
   And now his gloomy spirits seem to rise,
   As he the world beholds with clearer eyes;
   The cup he thought too full of dregs to quaff,
   Affords him wine enough to raise a laugh.
   (All this is metaphor - you must not think
   Our late Endymion prone to stronger drink!)
   With brighter visage and with lighter heart,
   He turns his fancies to the grocer's mart;
   And strange to say, at last he seems to find
   His daily duties worthy of his mind.
   Since Truth prov'd such a high and dang'rous goal,
   Our bard seeks one less trying to his soul;
   With deep-drawn breath he flouts his dreary woes,
   And a good clerk from a bad poet grows!
   Now close attend my lay, ye scribbling crew
   That bay the moon in numbers strange and new;
   That madly for the spark celestial bawl
   In metres short or long, or none at all;
   Curb your rash force, in numbers or at tea,
   Nor over-zealous for high fancies be;
   Reflect, ere ye the draught Pierian take,
   What worthy clerks or plumbers ye might make;
   Wax not too frenzied in the leaping line
   That neither sense nor measure can confine,
   Lest ye, like young Lucullus Launguish, groan
   Beneath Poe-etic nightmares of your own!

   8521The Quest of IranonH. P. Lovecraft1921

   Into the granite city of Teloth wandered the youth, vine-crowned, his
   yellow hair glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers
   of the mountain Sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone.
   The men of Teloth are dark and stern, and dwell in square houses, and
   with frowns they asked the stranger whence he had come and what were
   his name and fortune. So the youth answered:

   "I am Iranon, and come from Aira, a far city that I recall only dimly
   but seek to find again. I am a singer of songs that I learned in the
   far city, and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered
   of childhood. My wealth is in little memories and dreams, and in hopes
   that I sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs
   the lotus-buds."

   When the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one
   another; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or song,
   the stern men sometimes look to the Karthian hills in the spring and
   think of the lutes of distant Oonai whereof travellers have told. And
   thinking thus, they bade the stranger stay and sing in the square
   before the Tower of Mlin, though they liked not the colour of his
   tattered robe, nor the myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of
   vine-leaves, nor the youth in his golden voice. At evening Iranon sang,
   and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a
   nimbus over the singer's head. But most of the men of Teloth yawned,
   and some laughed and some went to sleep; for Iranon told nothing
   useful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes.

   "I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window
   where I was rocked to sleep. And through the window was the street
   where the golden lights came, and where the shadows danced on houses of
   marble. I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that was not
   like any other light, and the visions that danced on the moonbeams when
   my mother sang to me. And too, I remember the sun of morning bright
   above the many-coloured hills in summer, and the sweetness of flowers
   borne on the south wind that made the trees sing.

   "Oh Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties! How I
   loved the warm and fragrant groves across the hyline Nithra, and the
   falls of the tiny Kra that flowed though the verdant valley! In those
   groves and in the vale the children wove wreathes for one another, and
   at dusk I dreamed strange dreams under the yath-trees on the mountain
   as I saw below me the lights of the city, and the curving Nithra
   reflecting a ribbon of stars.

   "And in the city were the palaces of veined and tinted marble, with
   golden domes and painted walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools
   and crystal fountains. Often I played in the gardens and waded in the
   pools, and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees. And
   sometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel
   and the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble
   and beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame.

   "Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into
   exile; but my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for
   it is so decreed of Fate. All through seven lands have I sought thee,
   and some day shall I reign over thy groves and gardens, thy streets and
   palaces, and sing to men who shall know whereof I sing, and laugh not
   nor turn away. For I am Iranon, who was a Prince in Aira."

   That night the men of Teloth lodged the stranger in a stable, and in
   the morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of
   Athok the cobbler, and be apprenticed to him.

   "But I am Iranon, a singer of songs, " he said, "and have no heart for
   the cobbler's trade."

   "All in Teloth must toil," replied the archon, "for that is the law."
   Then said Iranon:

   "Wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? And if
   ye toil only that ye may toil more, when shall happiness find you? Ye
   toil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song? And if ye suffer
   no singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil
   without song is like a weary journey without an end. Were not death
   more pleasing?" But the archon was sullen and did not understand, and
   rebuked the stranger.

   "Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face nor thy voice. The
   words thou speakest are blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said
   that toil is good. Our gods have promised us a haven of light beyond
   death, where shall be rest without end, and crystal coldness amidst
   which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty. Go
   thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset.
   All here must serve, and song is folly."

   So Iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone
   streets between the gloomy square house of granite, seeking something
   green, for all was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by
   the stone embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sat a young boy with
   sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed
   down from the hills by the freshets. And the boy said to him:

   "Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far
   city in a fair land? I am Romnod, and borne of the blood of Teloth, but
   am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for the
   warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond the
   Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which men
   whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible.Thither would I go were
   I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go and thou
   wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the city of
   Teloth and fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt shew me
   the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening when the
   stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers. And
   peradventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even
   the fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known
   Aira since the old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai,
   O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and
   welcome us as brothers, nor even laugh or frown at what we say." And
   Iranon answered:

   "Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he
   must seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine
   by the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight and understanding
   dwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find in
   a day's, or a year's, or a lustrum's journey. Behold, when I was small
   like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where
   none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older I
   would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling
   dromedary-men in the marketplace. But when I went to Sinara I found the
   dromedary-men all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not
   as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren.
   And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I
   wandered to many cities. I have seen Stethelos that is below the great
   cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood. I have
   been to Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and
   have dwelt long in Olathoe in the land of Lomar. But though I have had
   listeners sometimes, they have ever been few. and I know that welcome
   shall wait me only in Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my
   father once ruled as King. So for Aira shall we seek, though it were
   well to visit distant and lute-blessed Oonai across the Karthianhills,
   which may indeed be Aira, though I think not. Aira's beauty is past
   imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilist of Oonai
   the camel-drivers whisper leeringly."

   At the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for
   long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests. The way was
   rough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of
   lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would
   sing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they
   were both happy after a fashion. They ate plentifully of fruit and red
   berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must have
   slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply
   instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his
   golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it
   came to pass that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though he had been
   very small when Iranon had found him watching for green budding
   branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zuro.

   Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain
   crest and looked down upon the myriad light of Oonai. Peasants had told
   them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city
   of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira; for they were
   harsh and glaring, while the lights of Aira shine as softly and
   magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where
   Iranon's mother once rocked him to sleep with song. But Oonai was a
   city of lutes and dancing, so Iranon and Romnod went down the steep
   slope that they might find men to whom sings and dreams would bring
   pleasure. And when they were come into the town they found
   rose-wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from
   windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed
   him flowers and applauded when he was done. Then for a moment did
   Iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he,
   though the town was not a hundredth as fair as Aira.

   When dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of Oonai
   were not golden in the sun, but grey and dismal. And the men of Oonai
   were pale with revelling, and dull with wine, and unlike the radient
   men of Aira. But because the people had thrown him blossoms and
   acclaimed his sings Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who liked
   the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle.
   Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he was always as
   before, crowned only in the vine of the mountains and remembering the
   marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the frescoed halls of
   the Monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that
   was a mirror, and as he sang, he brought pictures to his hearers till
   the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful, and half-remembered things
   instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted him with roses. And
   the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in
   satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of
   tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a
   bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of
   flower-embroidered silk. Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes
   and dancing.

   It is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King
   brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian
   desert, and dusky flute-players from Drinen in the East, and after that
   the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the dancers
   and flute-players. And day by day that Romnod who had been a small boy
   in granite Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till he dreamed
   less and less, amd listened with less delight to the songs of Iranon.
   But though Iranon was sad, he ceased not to sing, and at evening told
   again of his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl. Then one
   night the reddened and fattened Romnod snorted heavily amidst the
   poppied silks of his banquet-couch and died writhing, whilst Iranon,
   pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner. And when Iranon had
   wept over the grave of Romnod and strewn it with green branches, such
   as Romnod used to love, he put aside his silks and gauds and went
   forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes and dancing clad only in the
   ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded with fresh vines from
   the mountains.

   Into the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land and
   for men who would understand his songs and dreams. In all the cities of
   Cydathria and in the lands beyond the Bnazie desert gay-faced children
   laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple; but Iranon
   stayed ever young, and wore wreathes upon his golden head whilst he
   sang of Aira, delight of the past and hope of the future.

   So came he one night to the squallid cot of an antique shepherd, bent
   and dirty, who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh. To
   this man Iranon spoke, as to so many others:

   "Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and
   beryl, where flows the hyaline Nithra and where the falls of the tiny
   Kra sing to the verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees?"
   and the shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if
   recalling something very far away in time, and noted each line of the
   stranger's face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine-leaves. But
   he was old, and shook his head as he replied:

   "O stranger, I have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names
   thou hast spoken, but they come to me from afar down the waste of long
   years. I heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a beggar's
   boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales about the moon
   and the flowers and the west wind. We used to laugh at him, for we knew
   him from his birth though he thought himself a King's son. He was
   comely, even as thou, but full of folly and strangeness; and he ran
   away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and
   dreams. How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and
   things that never can be! Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the
   river Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra. There would he ever say he
   once dwelt as a Prince, though here we knew him from his birth. Nor was
   there ever a marble city of Aira, or those who could delight in strange
   songs, save in the dreams of mine old playmate Iranon who is gone."

   And in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast
   on the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the
   floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening, there walked into the lethal
   quicksands a very old man in tattered purple, crowned with whithered
   vine-leaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city
   where dreams are understood. That night something of youth and beauty
   died in the elder world.

   On 16 July 1923, I moved into Exham Priory after the last workman had
   finished his labours. The restoration had been a stupendous task, for
   little had remained of the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet
   because it had been the seat of my ancestors, I let no expense deter
   me. The place had not been inhabited since the reign of James the
   First, when a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely unexplained,
   nature had struck down the master, five of his children, and several
   servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the
   third son, my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred
   line.

   With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to
   the crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate
   himself or regain his property. Shaken by some horror greater than that
   of conscience or the law, and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude
   the ancient edifice from his sight and memory, Walter de la Poer,
   eleventh Baron Exham, fled to Virginia and there founded the family
   which by the next century had become known as Delapore.

   Exham Priory had remained untenanted, though later allotted to the
   estates of the Norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly
   composite architecture; an architecture involving Gothic towers resting
   on a Saxon or Romanesque substructure, whose foundation in turn was of
   a still earlier order or blend of orders--Roman, and even Druidic or
   native Cymric, if legends speak truly. This foundation was a very
   singular thing, being merged on one side with the solid limestone of
   the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley
   three miles west of the village of Anchester.

   Architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of
   forgotten centuries, but the country folk hated it. They had hated it
   hundreds of years before, when my ancestors lived there, and they hated
   it now, with the moss and mould of abandonment on it. I had not been a
   day in Anchester before I knew I came of an accursed house. And this
   week workmen have blown up Exham Priory, and are busy obliterating the
   traces of its foundations. The bare statistics of my ancestry I had
   always known, together with the fact that my first American forebear
   had come to the colonies under a strange cloud. Of details, however, I
   had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always
   maintained by the Delapores. Unlike our planter neighbours, we seldom
   boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and Renaissance
   heroes; nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have
   been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the Civil War by every
   squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening. The glories we
   cherished were those achieved since the migration; the glories of a
   proud and honourable, if somewhat reserved and unsocial Virginia line.

   During the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence
   changed by the burning of Carfax, our home on the banks of the James.
   My grandfather, advanced in years, had perished in that incendiary
   outrage, and with him the envelope that had bound us all to the past. I
   can recall that fire today as I saw it then at the age of seven, with
   the federal soldiers shouting, the women screaming, and the negroes
   howling and praying. My father was in the army, defending Richmond, and
   after many formalities my mother and I were passed through the lines to
   join him.

   When the war ended we all moved north, whence my mother had come; and I
   grew to manhood, middle age, and ultimate wealth as a stolid Yankee.
   Neither my father nor I ever knew what our hereditary envelope had
   contained, and as I merged into the greyness of Massachusetts business
   life I lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far
   back in my family tree. Had I suspected their nature, how gladly I
   would have left Exham Priory to its moss, bats and cobwebs!

   My father died in 1904, but without any message to leave to me, or to
   my only child, Alfred, a motherless boy of ten. It was this boy who
   reversed the order of family information, for although I could give him
   only jesting conjectures about the past, he wrote me of some very
   interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to England in
   1917 as an aviation officer. Apparently the Delapores had a colourful
   and perhaps sinister history, for a friend of my son's, Capt. Edward
   Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at
   Anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists
   could equal for wildness and incredibility. Norrys himself, of course,
   did not take them so seriously; but they amused my son and made good
   material for his letters to me. It was this legendry which definitely
   turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage, and made me resolve
   to purchase and restore the family seat which Norrys showed to Alfred
   in its picturesque desertion, and offered to get for him at a
   surprisingly reasonable figure, since his own uncle was the present
   owner.

   I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted
   from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed
   invalid. During the two years that he lived I thought of nothing but
   his care, having even placed my business under the direction of
   partners.

   In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer
   no longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new
   possession. Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt.
   Norrys, a plump, amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and
   secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the
   coming restoration. Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble
   of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with
   rooks' nests, perched perilously upon a precipice, and denuded of
   floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate
   towers.

   As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when
   my ancestors left it over three centuries before, I began to hire
   workmen for the reconstruction. In every case I was forced to go
   outside the immediate locality, for the Anchester villagers had an
   almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place. The sentiment was so
   great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers,
   causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to include both
   the priory and its ancient family.

   My son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits
   because he was a de la Poer, and I now found myself subtly ostracized
   for a like reason until I convinced the peasants how little I knew of
   my heritage. Even then they sullenly disliked me, so that I had to
   collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of Norrys.
   What the people could not forgive, perhaps, was that I had come to
   restore a symbol so abhorrent to them; for, rationally or not, they
   viewed Exham Priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and
   werewolves.

   Piecing together the tales which Norrys collected for me, and
   supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied
   the ruins, I deduced that Exham Priory stood on the site of a
   prehistoric temple; a Druidical or ante-Druidical thing which must have
   been contemporary with Stonehenge. That indescribable rites had been
   celebrated there, few doubted, and there were unpleasant tales of the
   transference of these rites into the Cybele worship which the Romans
   had introduced.

   Inscriptions still visible in the sub-cellar bore such unmistakable
   letters as 'DIV . . . OPS . . . MAGNA. MAT . . .', sign of the Magna
   Mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to Roman citizens.
   Anchester had been the camp of the third Augustan legion, as many
   remains attest, and it was said that the temple of Cybele was splendid
   and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the
   bidding of a Phrygian priest. Tales added that the fall of the old
   religion did not end the orgies at the temple, but that the priests
   lived on in the new faith without real change. Likewise was it said
   that the rites did not vanish with the Roman power, and that certain
   among the Saxons added to what remained of the temple, and gave it the
   essential outline it subsequently preserved, making it the centre of a
   cult feared through half the heptarchy. About 1000 A.D. the place is
   mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a
   strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens
   which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace. It was never
   destroyed by the Danes, though after the Norman Conquest it must have
   declined tremendously, since there was no impediment when Henry the
   Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron
   Exham, in 1261.

   Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something
   strange must have happened then. In one chronicle there is a reference
   to a de la Poer as "cursed of God in 1307", whilst village legendry had
   nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on
   the foundations of the old temple and priory. The fireside tales were
   of the most grisly description, all the ghastlier because of their
   frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness. They represented my
   ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz
   and the Marquis de Sade would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted
   whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearances
   of villagers through several generations.

   The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct
   heirs; at least, most was whispered about these. If of healthier
   inclinations, it was said, an heir would early and mysteriously die to
   make way for another more typical scion. There seemed to be an inner
   cult in the family, presided over by the head of the house, and
   sometimes closed except to a few members. Temperament rather than
   ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult, for it was entered by
   several who married into the family. Lady Margaret Trevor from
   Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the fifth baron, became a
   favourite bane of children all over the countryside, and the daemon
   heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the
   Welsh border. Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating the
   same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly
   after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his
   mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to
   whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world.

   These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition,
   repelled me greatly. Their persistence, and their application to so
   long a line of my ancestors, were especially annoying; whilst the
   imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the
   one known scandal of my immediate forebears--the case of my cousin,
   young Randolph Delapore of Carfax who went among the negroes and became
   a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War.

   I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in
   the barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the
   graveyard stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering,
   squealing white thing on which Sir John Clave's horse had trod one
   night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he
   saw in the priory in the full light of day. These things were hackneyed
   spectral lore, and I was at that time a pronounced sceptic. The
   accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed, though not
   especially significant in view of mediaeval custom. Prying curiosity
   meant death, and more than one severed head had been publicly shown on
   the bastions--now effaced--around Exham Priory.

   A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had
   learnt more of the comparative mythology in my youth. There was, for
   instance, the belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept witches'
   sabbath each night at the priory--a legion whose sustenance might
   explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested
   in the vast gardens. And, most vivid of all, there was the dramatic
   epic of the rats--the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst
   forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to
   desertion--the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all before
   it and devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless
   human beings before its fury was spent. Around that unforgettable
   rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered
   among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train.

   Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an
   elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not
   be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal
   psychological environment. On the other hand, I was constantly praised
   and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and
   aided me. When the task was done, over two years after its
   commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscoted walls, vaulted
   ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which
   fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration.

   Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced and the new
   parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The
   seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at
   last the local fame of the line which ended in me. I could reside here
   permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the
   original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was
   perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was
   mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from
   old vermin and old ghosts alike.

   As I have said, I moved in on 16 July 1923. My household consisted of
   seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly
   fond. My eldest cat, "Nigger-Man", was seven years old and had come
   with me from my home in Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had
   accumulated whilst living with Capt. Norrys' family during the
   restoration of the priory.

   For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time
   being spent mostly in the codification of old family data. I had now
   obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and
   flight of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable
   contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax. It
   appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed
   all the other members of his household, except four servant
   confederates, in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking
   discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but which, except by
   implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who
   assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach.

   This deliberate slaughter, which included a father, three brothers, and
   two sisters, was largely condoned by the villagers, and so slackly
   treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured, unharmed, and
   undisguised to Virginia; the general whispered sentiment being that he
   had purged the land of an immemorial curse. What discovery had prompted
   an act so terrible, I could scarcely even conjecture. Walter de la Poer
   must have known for years the sinister tales about his family, so that
   this material could have given him no fresh impulse. Had he, then,
   witnessed some appalling ancient rite, or stumbled upon some frightful
   and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity? He was reputed to
   have been a shy, gentle youth in England. In Virginia he seemed not so
   much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive. He was spoken of in
   the diary of another gentleman adventurer, Francis Harley of Bellview,
   as a man of unexampled justice, honour, and delicacy.

   On 22 July occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed
   at the time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later
   events. It was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not
   possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be
   recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new
   except for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of
   servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality.

   What I afterward remembered is merely this--that my old black cat,
   whose moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an
   extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character. He roved from
   room to room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the
   walls which formed part of the Gothic structure. I realize how trite
   this sounds--like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always
   growls before his master sees the sheeted figure--yet I cannot
   consistently suppress it.

   The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the
   cats in the house. He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the
   second storey, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple
   Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and
   even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the
   west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient
   stone.

   I told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from
   the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the
   delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly
   believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I
   mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years,
   and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be
   found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray.
   That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it
   would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a
   sudden and unprecedented fashion.

   That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west
   tower chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a
   stone staircase and short gallery--the former partly ancient, the
   latter entirely restored. This room was circular, very high, and
   without wainscoting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in
   London.

   Seeing that Nigger-Man was with me, I shut the heavy Gothic door and
   retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly
   counterfeited candles, finally switching off the light and sinking on
   the carved and canopied four-poster, with the venerable cat in his
   accustomed place across my feet. I did not draw the curtains, but gazed
   out at the narrow window which I faced. There was a suspicion of aurora
   in the sky, and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly
   silhouetted.

   At some time I must have fallen quietly asleep, for I recall a distinct
   sense of leaving strange dreams, when the cat started violently from
   his placid position. I saw him in the faint auroral glow, head strained
   forward, fore feet on my ankles, and hind feet stretched behind. He was
   looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window, a
   point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, but toward which all my
   attention was now directed.

   And as I watched, I knew that Nigger-Man was not vainly excited.
   Whether the arras actually moved I cannot say. I think it did, very
   slightly. But what I can swear to is that behind it I heard a low,
   distinct scurrying as of rats or mice. In a moment the cat had jumped
   bodily on the screening tapestry, bringing the affected section to the
   floor with his weight, and exposing a damp, ancient wall of stone;
   patched here and there by the restorers, and devoid of any trace of
   rodent prowlers.

   Nigger-Man raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall,
   clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw
   between the wall and the oaken floor. He found nothing, and after a
   time returned wearily to his place across my feet. I had not moved, but
   I did not sleep again that night.

   In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of
   them had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the
   actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill. This cat had
   howled at some unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for
   her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs.
   I drowsed away the noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt.
   Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in what I told him. The odd
   incidents--so slight yet so curious--appealed to his sense of the
   picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscenses of local
   ghostly lore. We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and
   Norrys lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants
   place in strategic localities when I returned.

   I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the
   most horrible sort. I seemed to be looking down from an immense height
   upon a twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded
   daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby
   beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing. Then, as
   the swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats
   rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man
   alike.

   From this terrific vision I was abruptly awakened by the motions of
   Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet. This time I
   did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of
   the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of
   their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive
   with nauseous sound--the verminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic
   rats. There was now no aurora to show the state of the arras--the
   fallen section of which had been replaced--but I was not too frightened
   to switch on the light.

   As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the
   tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular
   dance of death. This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound
   with it. Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long
   handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see
   what lay beneath. There was nothing but the patched stone wall, and
   even the cat had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences. When
   I examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found
   all of the openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been
   caught and had escaped.

   Further sleep was out of the question, so lighting a candle, I opened
   the door and went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study,
   Nigger-Man following at my heels. Before we had reached the stone
   steps, however, the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the
   ancient flight. As I descended the stairs myself, I became suddenly
   aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature which could
   not be mistaken.

   The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling
   whilst Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter.
   Reaching the bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time
   cause the noise to subside. The rats continued their riot, stampeding
   with such force and distinctness that I could finally assign to their
   motions a definite direction. These creatures, in numbers apparently
   inexhaustible, were engaged in one stupendous migration from
   inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or inconceivably below.

   I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants
   pushed open the massive door. They were searching the house for some
   unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a
   snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several
   flights of stairs and squat, yowling, before the closed door to the
   sub-cellar. I asked them if they had heard the rats, but they replied
   in the negative. And when I turned to call their attention to the
   sounds in the panels, I realized that the noise had ceased.

   With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found
   the cats already dispersed. Later I resolved to explore the crypt
   below, but for the present I merely made a round of the traps. All were
   sprung, yet all were tenantless. Satisfying myself that no one had
   heard the rats save the felines and me, I sat in my study till morning,
   thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend I had unearthed
   concerning the building I inhabited. I slept some in the forenoon,
   leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval
   plan of furnishing could not banish. Later I telephoned to Capt.
   Norrys, who came over and helped me explore the sub-cellar.

   Absolutely nothing untoward was found, although we could not repress a
   thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by Roman hands. Every
   low arch and massive pillar was Roman--not the debased Romanesque of
   the bungling Saxons, but the severe and harmonious classicism of the
   age of the Caesars; indeed, the walls abounded with inscriptions
   familiar to the antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the
   place--things like "P. GETAE. PROP . . . TEMP . . . DONA . . ." and "L.
   PRAEG . . . VS . . . PONTIFI . . . ATYS . . ."

   The reference to Atys made me shiver, for I had read Catullus and knew
   something of the hideous rites of the Eastern god, whose worship was so
   mixed with that of Cybele. Norrys and I, by the light of lanterns,
   tried to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain
   irregularly rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars,
   but could make nothing of them. We remembered that one pattern, a sort
   of rayed sun, was held by students to imply a non-Roman origin
   suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the Roman
   priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site.
   On one of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder. The
   largest, in the centre of the room, had certain features on the upper
   surface which indicated its connection with fire--probably burnt
   offerings.

   Such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats howled,
   and where Norrys and I now determined to pass the night. Couches were
   brought down by the servants, who were told not to mind any nocturnal
   actions of the cats, and Nigger-Man was admitted as much for help as
   for companionship. We decided to keep the great oak door--a modern
   replica with slits for ventilation--tightly closed; and, with this
   attended to, we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever
   might occur.

   The vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory, and
   undoubtedly far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff
   overlooking the waste valley. That it had been the goal of the
   scuffling and unexplainable rats I could not doubt, though why, I could
   not tell. As we lay there expectantly, I found my vigil occasionally
   mixed with half-formed dreams from which the uneasy motions of the cat
   across my feet would rouse me.

   These dreams were not wholesome, but horribly like the one I had had
   the night before. I saw again the twilit grotto, and the swineherd with
   his unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth, and as I looked at
   these things they seemed nearer and more distinct--so distinct that I
   could almost observe their features. Then I did observe the flabby
   features of one of them--and awakened with such a scream that
   Nigger-Man started up, whilst Capt. Norrys, who had not slept, laughed
   considerably. Norrys might have laughed more--or perhaps less--had he
   known what it was that made me scream. But I did not remember myself
   till later. Ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful way.

   Norrys waked me when the phenomena began. Out of the same frightful
   dream I was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to
   the cats. Indeed, there was much to listen to, for beyond the closed
   door at the head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline
   yelling and clawing, whilst Nigger-Man, unmindful of his kindred
   outside, was running excitedly round the bare stone walls, in which I
   heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the night
   before.

   An acute terror now rose within me, for here were anomalies which
   nothing normal could well explain. These rats, if not the creatures of
   a madness which I shared with the cats alone, must be burrowing and
   sliding in Roman walls I had thought to be solid limestone blocks . . .
   unless perhaps the action of water through more than seventeen
   centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear
   and ample . . . But even so, the spectral horror was no less; for if
   these were living vermin why did not Norrys hear their disgusting
   commotion? Why did he urge me to watch Nigger-Man and listen to the
   cats outside, and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could
   have aroused them?

   By the time I had managed to tell him, as rationally as I could, what I
   thought I was hearing, my ears gave me the last fading impression of
   scurrying; which had retreated still downward, far underneath this
   deepest of sub-cellars till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were
   riddled with questing rats. Norrys was not as sceptical as I had
   anticipated, but instead seemed profoundly moved. He motioned to me to
   notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour, as if giving
   up the rats for lost; whilst Nigger-Man had a burst of renewed
   restlessness, and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the
   large stone altar in the centre of the room, which was nearer Norrys'
   couch than mine.

   My fear of the unknown was at this point very great. Something
   astounding had occurred, and I saw that Capt. Norrys, a younger,
   stouter, and presumably more naturally materialistic man, was affected
   fully as much as myself--perhaps because of his lifelong and intimate
   familiarity with local legend. We could for the moment do nothing but
   watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base
   of the altar, occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that
   persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some
   favour for him.

   Norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place
   where Nigger-Man was pawing; silently kneeling and scraping away the
   lichens of the centuries which joined the massive pre-Roman block to
   the tessellated floor. He did not find anything, and was about to
   abandon his efforts when I noticed a trivial circumstance which made me
   shudder, even though it implied nothing more than I had already
   imagined.

   I told him of it, and we both looked at its almost imperceptible
   manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and
   acknowledgment. It was only this--that the flame of the lantern set
   down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a
   draught of air which it had not before received, and which came
   indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where Norrys was
   scraping away the lichens.

   We spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly-lighted study,
   nervously discussing what we should do next. The discovery that some
   vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the Romans underlay this
   accursed pile, some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of
   three centuries, would have been sufficient to excite us without any
   background of the sinister. As it was, the fascination became two-fold;
   and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the
   priory forever in superstitious caution, or to gratify our sense of
   adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown
   depths.

   By morning we had compromised, and decided to go to London to gather a
   group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the
   mystery. It should be mentioned that before leaving the sub-cellar we
   had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognized as
   the gate to a new pit of nameless fear. What secret would open the
   gate, wiser men than we would have to find.

   During many days in London Capt. Norrys and I presented our facts,
   conjectures, and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities, all
   men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future
   explorations might develop. We found most of them little disposed to
   scoff but, instead, intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic. It
   is hardly necessary to name them all, but I may say that they included
   Sir William Brinton, whose excavations in the Troad excited most of the
   world in their day. As we all took the train for Anchester I felt
   myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations, a sensation
   symbolized by the air of mourning among the many Americans at the
   unexpected death of the President on the other side of the world.

   On the evening of 7 August we reached Exham Priory, where the servants
   assured me that nothing unusual had occurred. The cats, even old
   Nigger-Man, had been perfectly placid, and not a trap in the house had
   been sprung. We were to begin exploring on the following day, awaiting
   which I assigned well-appointed rooms to all my guests.

   I myself retired in my own tower chamber, with Nigger-Man across my
   feet. Sleep came quickly, but hideous dreams assailed me. There was a
   vision of a Roman feast like that of Trimalchio, with a horror in a
   covered platter. Then came that damnable, recurrent thing about the
   swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto. Yet when I awoke
   it was full daylight, with normal sounds in the house below. The rats,
   living or spectral, had not troubled me; and Nigger-Man was still
   quietly asleep. On going down, I found that the same tranquillity had
   prevailed elsewhere; a condition which one of the assembled servants--a
   fellow named Thornton, devoted to the psychic--rather absurdly laid to
   the fact that I had now been shown the thing which certain forces had
   wished to show me.

   All was now ready, and at 11 A.M. our entire group of seven men,
   bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation,
   went down to the sub-cellar and bolted the door behind us. Nigger-Man
   was with us, for the investigators found no occasion to depise his
   excitability, and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of
   obscure rodent manifestations. We noted the Roman inscriptions and
   unknown altar designs only briefly, for three of the savants had
   already seen them, and all knew their characteristics. Prime attention
   was paid to the momentous central altar, and within an hour Sir William
   Brinton had caused it to tilt backward, balanced by some unknown
   species of counterweight.

   There now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had
   we not been prepared. Through a nearly square opening in the tiled
   floor, sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that
   it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly
   array of human or semi-human bones. Those which retained their
   collocation as skeletons showed attitudes of panic fear, and over all
   were the marks of rodent gnawing. The skulls denoted nothing short of
   utter idiocy, cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom.

   Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage
   seemingly chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of
   air. This current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed
   vault, but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it. We did not
   pause long, but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps. It
   was then that Sir William, examining the hewn walls, made the odd
   observation that the passage, according to the direction of the
   strokes, must have been chiselled from beneath.

   I must be very deliberate now, and choose my words. After ploughing
   down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light
   ahead; not any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which
   could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that
   over-looked the waste valley. That such fissures had escaped notice
   from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly
   uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an
   aeronaut could study its face in detail. A few steps more, and our
   breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally
   that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms
   of the dazed men who stood behind him. Norrys, his plump face utterly
   white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately; whilst I think that
   what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my eyes.

   The man behind me--the only one of the party older than I--croaked the
   hackneyed "My God!" in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven
   cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure, a
   thing the more to his credit because he led the party and must have
   seen the sight first.

   It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than
   any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and
   horrible suggestion. There were buildings and other architectural
   remains--in one terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a
   savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon
   pile, and an early English edifice of wood--but all these were dwarfed
   by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the
   ground. For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human
   bones, or bones at least as human as those on the steps. Like a foamy
   sea they stretched, some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly
   articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of
   daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or clutching other
   forms with cannibal intent.

   When Dr Trask, the anthropologist, stopped to classify the skulls, he
   found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him. They were mostly
   lower than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every
   case definitely human. Many were of higher grade, and a very few were
   the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types. All the bones
   were gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human
   drove. Mixed with them were many tiny bones of rats--fallen members of
   the lethal army which closed the ancient epic.

   I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that
   hideous day of discovery. Not Hoffman nor Huysmans could conceive a
   scene more wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more
   Gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven
   staggered; each stumbling on revelation after revelation, and trying to
   keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken
   place there three hundred, or a thousand, or two thousand or ten
   thousand years ago. It was the antechamber of hell, and poor Thornton
   fainted again when Trask told him that some of the skeleton things must
   have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more
   generations.

   Horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural
   remains. The quadruped things--with their occasional recruits from the
   biped class--had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have
   broken in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear. There had been
   great herds of them, evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose
   remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of
   the huge stone bins older than Rome. I knew now why my ancestors had
   had such excessive gardens--would to heaven I could forget! The purpose
   of the herds I did not have to ask.

   Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin,
   translated aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told
   of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found
   and mingled with their own. Norrys, used as he was to the trenches,
   could not walk straight when he came out of the English building. It
   was a butcher shop and kitchen--he had expected that--but it was too
   much to see familiar English implements in such a place, and to read
   familiar English graffiti there, some as recent as 1610. I could not go
   in that building--that building whose daemon activities were stopped
   only by the dagger of my ancestor Walter de la Poer.

   What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building whose oaken door
   had fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with
   rusty bars. Three had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the
   bony forefinger of one I found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms.
   Sir William found a vault with far older cells below the Roman chapel,
   but these cells were empty. Below them was a low crypt with cases of
   formally arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible parallel
   inscriptions carved in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phyrgia.

   Meanwhile, Dr Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and
   brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a
   gorilla's, and which bore indescribably ideographic carvings. Through
   all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed. Once I saw him monstrously
   perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that
   might lie behind his yellow eyes.

   Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this
   twilit area--an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent
   dream--we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern
   where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate. We shall never
   know what sightless Stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we
   went, for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind.
   But there was plenty to engross us close at hand, for we had not gone
   far before the searchlights showed that accursed infinity of pits in
   which the rats had feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had
   driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of
   starving things, and then to burst forth from the priory in that
   historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget.

   God! those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls!
   Those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman,
   and English bones of countless unhallowed centuries! Some of them were
   full, and none can say how deep they had once been. Others were still
   bottomless to our searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies. What,
   I thought, of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the
   blackness of their quests in this grisly Tartarus?

   Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment
   of ecstatic fear. I must have been musing a long time, for I could not
   see any of the party but plump Capt. Norrys. Then there came a sound
   from that inky, boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and
   I saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged Egyptian god,
   straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown. But I was not far
   behind, for there was no doubt after another second. It was the
   eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new
   horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns
   of earth's centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls
   blindly in the darkness to the piping of two amorphous idiot
   flute-players.

   My searchlight expired, but still I ran. I heard voices, and yowls, and
   echoes, but above all there gently rose that impious, insidious
   scurrying; gently rising, rising, as a stiff bloated corpse gently
   rises above an oily river that flows under the endless onyx bridges to
   a black, putrid sea.

   Something bumped into me--something soft and plump. It must have been
   the rats; the viscous, gelatinous, ravenous army that feast on the dead
   and the living. . . . Why shouldn't rats eat a de la Poer as a de la
   Poer eats forbidden things? . . . The war ate my boy, damn them
   all . . . and the Yanks ate Carfax with flames and burnt Grandsire
   Delapore and the secret.  .. . No, no, I tell you, I am not that daemon
   swineherd in the twilit grotto! It was not Edward Norrys' fat face on
   that flabby fungous thing! Who says I am a de la Poer? He lived, but my
   boy died! . . . Shall a Norrys hold the land of a de la Poer? . . .
   It's voodoo, I tell you . . . that spotted snake . . . Curse you,
   Thornton, I'll teach you to faint at what my family do! . . . 'Sblood,
   thou stinkard, I'll learn ye how to gust . . . wolde ye swynke me
   thilke wys? . . . Magna Mater! Magna Mater! . . . Atys . . . Dia ad
   aghaidh's ad aodaun . . . agus bas dunarch ort! Dhonas 's dholas ort,
   agus leat-sa! . . . Ungl unl . . . rrlh . . . chchch . . .

   This is what they say I said when they found me in the blackness after
   three hours; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump,
   half-eaten body of Capt. Norrys, with my own cat leaping and tearing at
   my throat. Now they have blown up Exham Priory, taken my Nigger-Man
   away from me, and shut me into this barred room at Hanwell with fearful
   whispers about my heredity and experience. Thornton is in the next
   room, but they prevent me from talking to him. They are trying, too, to
   suppress most of the facts concerning the priory. When I speak of poor
   Norrys they accuse me of this hideous thing, but they must know that I
   did not do it. They must know it was the rats; the slithering scurrying
   rats whose scampering will never let me sleep; the daemon rats that
   race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater
   horrors than I have ever known; the rats they can never hear; the rats,
   the rats in the walls.

   The Rose of England
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   12314The Rose of EnglandH. P. Lovecraft

   At morn the rosebud greets the sun
   And sheds the evening dew,
   Expanding ere the day is done,
      In bloom of radiant hue
   And when the sun his rest hath found,
   Rose-Petals strew the garden round!

   Thus that blest Isle that owns the Rose
   From mist and darkness came,
   A million glories to disclose,
      And spread BRITANNIA'S name;
   And ere Life's Sun shall leave the blue,
   ENGLAND shall reign the whole world through!

The Rutted Road

   The Rutted Road by H.P. Lovecraft

   Bleak autumn mists send down their chilly load, A raven shivers as he
   flutters by; Thro' lonely pasture winds the Rutted Road Where bord'ring
   elms loom bare against the sky.

   Those deep-sunk tracks, which dumbly point ahead, O'er travell'd sands
   that stretch to Vision's rim, Wake hidden thoughts--a longing half a
   dread-- Till Fancy pauses at the prospect dim.

   Descending shadows bid me haste along The ancient ruts so many knew
   before; A cricket mocks me with his mirthless song-- I fear the path--I
   fain would see no more.

   Yet here, with ox-drawn cart, each thoughtless swain His course
   pursu'd, nor left the common way; Can I, superior to the rustic train,
   On brighter by-roads find the dawning day?

   With questing look, I scan the dark'ning moor; Perchance o'er yonder
   mound all blessings wait, But still the Rutted Road's resistless lure
   Constrains my progress to the Path of Fate.

   So must I grope between the brooding trees Where those before me found
   the mystic night; I travel onward, past the wither'd leas- But what,
   beyond the bend, awaits my sight?

   Do fairer lands than this invite my feet? Will Fate on me her choicest
   boon bestow? What lies head, my weary soul to greet? Why is it that I
   do not wish to know?

   "Now be good children" Said Mrs. Lee "While I am away & dont get into
   mischief". Mr. & Mrs. Lee were going off for the day & To leave The Two
   children John 10 yrs old & Alice 2 yrs old "Yes" replied John

   As Soon as The Elder Lees were away the younger Lees went down cellar &
   began to rummage among the rubbish little alice leaned against the wall
   watching John. As John was making a boat of barrel staves the Little
   girl gave a piercing cry as the bricks behind her crumbled away he
   rushed up to her & Lifted her out screaming loudly as soon as her
   screams subsided she said "the wall went away" John went up & saw that
   there was a passage he said to the little girl "lets come & see what
   this is" "Yes" she said the entered the place they could stand up it
   the passage was farther than they could see they John went back
   upstairs & went to the kitchen drawer & got 2 candles & some matches &
   then they went back to the cellar passage. the two once more entered
   there was plastering on the walls ceiling & floor nothing was visible
   but a box this was for a seat nevertheless they examined it & found it
   to contain nothing the walked on farther & pretty soon the plastering
   left off & they were in a cave Little alice was frightened at first but
   at her brothers assurance that it was "all right" she allayed her
   fears. soon they came to a small box which John took up & carried
   within pretty soon they came on a boat in it were two oars he dragged
   it with difficulty along with him soon they found the passage came to
   an abrupt stop he pulled the obstacle away & to his dismay water rushed
   in in torrents John was an expert swimmer & long breathede he had Just
   taken a breath so he tried to rise but with the box & his sister he
   found it quite impossible then he caught sight of the boat rising he
   grasped it. . . .

   The next he knew he was on the surface clinging tightly to the body of
   his sister & the mysterious box he could not imagine how the water got
   in but a new peril menaced them if the water continued rising it would
   rise to the top suddenly a thought presented itself. he could shut off
   the water he speedily did this & lifting the now lifeless body of his
   sister into the boat he himself climed in & sailed down the passage it
   was gruesome & uncanny absolutely dark his candle being put out by the
   flood & a dead body lying near he did not gaze about him but rowed for
   his life when he did look up he was floating in his own cellar he
   quickly rushed up stairs with the body, to find his parents had come
   home He told them the story

   * * * * * *

   The funeral of alice occupied so much time that John quite forgot about
   the box--but when they did open it they found it to be a solid gold
   chunk worth about $10,000 enough to pay for any thing but the death of
   his sister.

   The Shunned House

                             By H. P. LOVECRAFT

      A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird
   fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old house in
                                 New England

   From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes it
   enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it
   relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places. The
   latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of
   Providence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn
   often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs.
   Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in Benefit
   Street--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered
   Washington, Jefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led
   northward along the same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the
   neighboring hillside churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of
   Eighteenth Century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.
   o Howard Phillips Lovecraft died last March, at the height of his
   career. Though only forty-six years of age, he had built up an
   international reputation by the artistry and impeccable literary
   craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides of
   the Atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of weird
   fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding dread and
   unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the posthumous tale
   presented here: "The Shunned House."

   Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the
   world's greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to
   pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy,
   antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a
   great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open
   country. It does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is
   there any evidence that he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the
   two persons in possession of certain information, equals or outranks in
   horror the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it
   unknowingly, and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is
   unutterably hideous.

   The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the
   attention of the curious. Originally a farm or semifarm building, it
   followed the average New England colonial lines of the middle
   Eighteenth Century--the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories
   and dormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior
   panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced
   south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward
   rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the
   street. Its construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed
   the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity;
   for Benefit Street--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane
   winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened
   only when the removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it
   decently possible to cut through the old family plots.

   At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a
   precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at
   about the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening
   space, exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be
   made, giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window
   above ground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk
   was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was
   removed; and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of
   dull gray brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of
   ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper.

   Picture of a man leaving a house, inset in a picture of a naked,
   bearded man cowering among plants.

   "That awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar."

   The farm-like ground extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to
   Wheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit
   Street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level,
   forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone
   pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between
   canyon-like surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick
   walks, and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted
   kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia
   set off the weather-beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting
   Ionic pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment.

   What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people
   died there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why the
   original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the
   place. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and
   fungous growths in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the drafts of
   the hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things
   were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the
   persons whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor
   Elihu Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises
   which formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and
   humble folk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely
   forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting
   modern population.

   The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid
   part of the community as in any real sense "haunted." There were no
   widespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished
   lights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was
   "unlucky," but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond
   dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more
   accurately, had died there, since after some peculiar happenings over
   sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer
   impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off
   suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was
   insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever
   tendency to weakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not
   die displayed in varying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and
   sometimes a decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the
   salubriousness of the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added,
   seemed entirely free from the noxious quality.

   This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show
   me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous
   investigation. In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with
   barren, gnarled and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and
   nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds
   never lingered. We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still
   recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this
   sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odor of the
   dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest
   of shudders. The small-paned windows were largely broken, and a
   nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky
   interior shutters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster, rickety
   staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained.
   The dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful; and brave indeed
   was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic, a
   vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the
   gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and
   spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and
   festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes.

   But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house.
   It was the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest
   repulsion on us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street
   side, with only a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate
   it from the busy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in
   spectral fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our
   sanity. For one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there;
   and for another thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which
   occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth
   floor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard
   outside, were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of
   toadstools and Indian-pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other
   situation. They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly
   phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of
   witch-fires glowing behind the broken panes of the fetor-spreading
   windows.

   We never--even in our wildest Halloween moods--visited this cellar by
   night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the
   phosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was
   also a subtler thing we often thought we detected--a very strange thing
   which was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of
   cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit of
   mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the
   sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen.
   Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny
   resemblance to a doubled-up human figure. though generally no such
   kinship existed, and often there was no whitish deposit whatever.

   On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally
   strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin,
   yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward
   the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled
   at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with
   reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of
   the wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding
   to ghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and
   queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust
   their way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones.

   2

   Not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data
   which he had collected concerning the shunned house. Doctor Whipple was
   a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for ail his
   interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward
   the abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location
   of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality;
   but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own
   interest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome
   imaginative associations.

   The doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashioned
   gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance
   with such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and
   Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one man-servant in a Georgian
   homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on the
   steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and
   colony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebrated
   privateersman, Captain Whipple, who burnt His Majesty's armed schooner
   Gaspee in 1772--had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the
   independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp,
   low-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved
   overmantel and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics and
   records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions
   to the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not far
   distant--for Benefit runs Iedgewise just above the court house along
   the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed.

   When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from
   my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange
   enough chronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical
   as some of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of
   brooding, tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which
   impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate
   events fitted together uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held
   mines of hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me,
   compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate.

   The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that
   shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at
   the last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and
   after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am
   lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with
   honor, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a
   marble urn to his memory in St. John's churchyard--the place that Poe
   loved--the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and
   headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the
   houses and bank walls of Benefit Street.

   The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no
   trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the
   prosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a
   taint of calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent.
   My uncle's carefully compiled record began with the building of the
   structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of
   detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William
   Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in
   1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born
   in 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India
   trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After
   Brown's death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Company made
   him master of the brig Prudence, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus
   enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his
   marriage.

   The site he had chosen--a recently straightened part of the new and
   fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above
   crowded Cheapside--was all that could be wished, and the building did
   justice to the location. It was the best that moderate means could
   afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth
   child which the family expected. That child, a boy. came in December;
   but was stillborn. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for
   a century and a half.

   The next April, sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and
   Ruth died before the month was over. Doctor Job Ives diagnosed the
   trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of
   a mere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be
   contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in
   the following June. Eli Lideason, the other servant, constantly
   complained of weakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in
   Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was
   hired to succeed Hannah. He died the next year--a sad year indeed,
   since it marked the death of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he
   was by the climate of Martinique, where his occupation had kept him for
   considerable periods during the preceding decade.

   The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her
   husband's death, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years
   later was the final blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a
   mild form of insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of
   the house; her elder maiden sister, Mercy Dexter, having moved in to
   take charge of the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great
   strength; but her health visibly declined from the time of her advent.
   She was greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an especial
   affection for her only surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy
   infant had become a sickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant
   Mehitabel died, and the other servant, Preserved Smith, left without
   coherent explanation--or at least, with only some wild tales and a
   complaint that he disliked the smell of the place. For a time Mercy
   could secure no more help, since the seven deaths and case of madness,
   all occurring within five years' space, had begun to set in motion the
   body of fireside rumor which later became so bizarre. Ultimately,
   however, she obtained new servants from out of town; Ann White, a
   morose woman from that part of North Kingstown now set off as the
   township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named Zenas Low.

   It was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle
   talk. Mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the
   Nooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as
   now, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892
   an Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its
   heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the
   public health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of the
   same section in 1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously active, and within
   a few months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful
   and amiable Amazon from Newport, Maria Robbins.

   Meanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her madness, gave voice to dreams and
   imaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams became
   insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors
   which necessitated her son's temporary residence with his cousin, Peleg
   Harris, in Presbyterian Lane near the new college building. The boy
   would seem to improve after these visits, and had Mercy been as wise as
   she was well-meaning, she would have let him live permanently with
   Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of violence,
   tradition hesitates to say; or rather, presents such extravagant
   accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity.
   Certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the
   rudiments of French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic
   form of that language, or that the same person, alone and guarded,
   complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In
   1772 the servant Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she
   laughed with a shocking delight utterly foreign to her. The next year
   she herself died, and was laid to rest in the North Burial Ground
   beside her husband.

   Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775. William
   Harris, despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution,
   managed to enlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and
   from that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In
   1780, as a captain in the Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under
   Colonel Angell, he met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabeth town,
   whom he brought to Providence upon his honorable discharge in the
   following year.

   The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness.
   The house, it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had
   been widened and changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street.
   But Mercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious
   decay, so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow
   voice and disconcerting pallor--qualities shared to a singular degree
   by the one remaining servant Maria. In the autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris
   gave birth to a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next
   May Mercy Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.

   William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically
   unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and
   closing it for ever. Securing temporary quarters for himself and his
   wife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he arranged for the building
   of a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part of
   the town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee was
   born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce
   drove them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, in
   the newer East Side residence district, where the late Archer Harris
   built his sumptuous but hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876. William
   and Phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, but
   Dutee was brought up by his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg's son.

   Rathbone was a practical man, and rented the Benefit Street house
   despite William's wish to keep it vacant. He considered it an
   obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor
   did he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so
   many changes of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which
   the house was generally regarded. It is likely that he felt only
   vexation when, in 1804, the town council ordered him to fumigate the
   place with sulfur, tar, and gum camphor on account of the
   much-discussed deaths of four persons, presumably caused by the then
   diminishing fever epidemic. They said the place had a febrile smell.

   Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a
   privateersman, and served with distinction on the Vigilant under
   Captain Cahoone in the War of 1812. He returned unharmed, married in
   1814, and became a father on that memorable night of September 23,
   1815, when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town,
   and floated a tall sloop well up Westminster Street so that its masts
   almost tapped the Harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new
   boy, Welcome, was a seaman's son.

   Welcome did not survive his father, but lived to perish gloriously at
   Fredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the
   shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to
   rent--perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt
   old age. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths
   culminating in 1861, which the excitement of the war tended to throw
   into obscurity. Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only
   as a deserted and somewhat picturesque center of legend until I told
   him my experience. He had meant to tear it down and build an apartment
   house on the site, but after my account decided to let it stand,
   install plumbing, and rent it. Nor has he yet had any difficulty in
   obtaining tenants. The horror has gone.

                                      3

   It may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals of
   the Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a
   persistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil
   clearly connected with the house and not with the family. This
   impression was confirmed by my uncle's less systematic array of
   miscellaneous data--legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttings
   from the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow-physicians, and
   the like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was
   a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;
   but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their
   recurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the
   servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous
   and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.
   There had been servants--Ann White especially--who would not use the
   cellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon the
   queer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and
   patches of mold in that region. These latter narratives interested me
   profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt
   that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by
   additions from the common stock of local ghost lore.

   Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most
   extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that
   there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires--the dead
   who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the
   living--whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits
   abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say,
   exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that
   organ; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had
   been prominent in bringing about her discharge.

   Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more
   readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for
   burial purposes. To me their interest depended less on this
   circumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they
   dovetailed with certain other things--the complaint of the departing
   servant Preserved Smith, who had preceded Ann and never heard of her,
   that something "sucked his breath" at night; the death-certificates of
   the fever victims of 1804, issued by Doctor Chad Hopkins, and showing
   the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood; and the
   obscure passages of poor Rhoby Harris's ravings, where she complained
   of the sharp teeth of a glassy-eyed, half-visible presence.

   Free from unwarranted superstitition though I am, these things produced
   in me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely
   separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned
   house--one from the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12,
   1815, and the other from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October
   27, 1845--each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance
   whose duplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the
   dying person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a
   schoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured
   in a horrible way, glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat
   of the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final
   case which put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia
   deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would
   craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or
   wrist.

   This was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medical
   practise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his
   elder professional colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the
   way in which the victims--ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and
   widely shunned house could now be rented to no others--would babble
   maledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied
   to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century
   before, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical
   data on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his return
   from the war, to the first-hand account of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.
   Indeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject,
   and that he was glad of my own interest--an open-minded and sympathetic
   interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others
   would merely have laughed. His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but
   he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, and
   worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and
   macabre.

   For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profound
   seriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but to
   accumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer
   Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916;
   and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an
   authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected.
   When, however, I asked them what connection with France or its language
   the house could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and
   ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could say
   was that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee Harris, had heard of
   might have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his
   son Welcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known the
   legend, but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria
   Robbins, seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird
   significance to the French raving of Rhoby Harris, which she had so
   often heard during the last days of that hapless woman. Maria had been
   at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783,
   and had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a
   somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but lie had
   soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar. The
   granddaughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. She
   and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was
   Archer's son Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my
   experience.

   Having exhausted the Harris family of all the information it could
   furnish, I turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a
   zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown
   in the same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site
   from its very settlement in 1636--or even before, if any Narragansett
   Indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data. I found, at the
   start, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot
   granted originally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips
   beginning at the Town Street beside the river and extending up over the
   hill to a line roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The
   Throckmorton lot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I
   became very assiduous in tracing that section through which Back or
   Benefit Street was later run. It had, as rumor indeed said, been the
   Throckmorton graveyard; but as I examined the records more carefully, I
   found that the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the
   North Burial Ground on the Pawtucket West Road.

   Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in
   the main body of records and might easily have been missed-- upon
   something which aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with
   several of the queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a
   lease, in 1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and
   wife. At last the French element had appeared--that, and another deeper
   element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses
   of my weird and heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the
   platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and
   partial straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found
   what I had half expected, that where the shunned house now stood the
   Roulets had laid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic
   cottage, and that no record of any transfer of graves existed,
   document, indeed, ended in much confusion; and I was forced to ransack
   both the Rhode Island Historical Society and Shepley Library before I
   could find a local door which the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock.
   In the end I did find something; something of such vague but monstrous
   import that I set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned
   house itself with a new and excited minuteness.

   The Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the
   west shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Canude, and
   had encountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed
   them to settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East
   Greenwich, whither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the
   Edict of Nantes, and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended
   beyond mere racial and national prejudice, or the land disputes which
   involved other French settlers with the English in rivalries which not
   even Governor Andros could quell. But their ardent Protestantism--too
   ardent, some whispered--and their evident distress when virtually
   driven from the village down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the
   town fathers. Here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the
   swarthy Etienne Roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer
   books and drawing queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the
   warehouse at Pardon Tillinghast's wharf, far south in Town Street.
   There had, however, been a riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty
   years later, after old Roulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the
   family after that.

   For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well
   remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet
   life of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose
   erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the
   family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence
   never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbors, it was
   freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at
   the proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this had
   undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.
   What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other
   inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone
   could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends
   realized that additional link with the terrible which my wider reading
   had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror whiich
   tells of the creature Jacques Roulet, of Caude, who in 1598 was
   condemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake by
   the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered
   with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and
   rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away
   unhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as
   to name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not
   have generally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names
   would have brought some drastic and frightened action--indeed, might
   not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which
   erased the Roulets from the town?

   I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the
   unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the
   building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.
   Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the
   disused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street,
   preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than
   the dark stairs, ground-floor hall, and front door could give. There,
   where morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long
   afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed
   above-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked
   door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside.
   Nothing new rewarded my efforts--only the same depressing mustiness and
   faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the
   floor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously
   through the broken panes.

   At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot
   nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch
   over the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,
   half-phosphorescent fungi. The place had dispirited me curiously that
   evening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidst
   the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the "huddled
   form" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clearness was astonishing and
   unprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,
   yellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy
   afternoon so many years before.

   Above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; a
   subtle, sickish, almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in
   the dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,
   gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the
   blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was truly
   horrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.
   Refusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it
   was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than
   visible. When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and
   after a tense hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic
   decision. Weighing in his mind the importance of the matter, and the
   significance of our relation to it, he insisted that we both test--and
   if possible destroy--the horror of the house by a joint night or nights
   of aggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.

                                      4

   On Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of Carrington
   Harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find,
   my uncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a
   folding camp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater
   weight and intricacy. These we placed in the cellar during the day,
   screening the windows with paper and planning to return in the evening
   for our first vigil. We had locked the door from the cellar to the
   ground floor; and having a key to the outside cellar door, were
   prepared to leave our expensive and delicate apparatus--which we had
   obtained secretly and at great cost--as many days as our vigils might
   be protracted. It was our design to sit up together till very late, and
   then watch singly till dawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and
   then my companion; the inactive member resting on the cot.

   The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments
   from the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street
   Armory, and instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a
   marvelous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man
   of eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws
   he had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would
   be here in full vigor today. Only two persons suspected what did
   happen--Carrington Harris and myself, I had to tell Harris because he
   owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,
   we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my
   uncles going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally
   necessary public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to help
   me, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house.

   To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching
   would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I
   have said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study
   and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three
   dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of
   substance and energy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of
   evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious
   existence" of certain forces of great power and, so far as the human
   point of view is concerned, exceptional malignancy. To say that we
   actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly
   inclusive statement. Rather must it be said that we were not prepared
   to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified
   modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very
   infrequently in three-dimensional space because of its more intimate
   connection with other spatial units, yet close enough to the boundary
   of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we, for lack
   of a proper vantage-point, may never hope to understand.

   In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array
   of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;
   traceable to one or another of the ill-favored French settlers of two
   centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of
   atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed
   an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity--dark spheres which
   for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror--their recorded history
   seemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone
   seventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid
   brain of one or more of them-- notably the sinister Paul Roulet--which
   obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and
   continued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along the
   original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the
   encroaching community?

   Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in
   the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity
   and intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of
   substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible
   or immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissue and
   fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it
   penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself.
   It might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind
   motives of self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of
   necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose
   extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the
   world's life, health, and sanity.

   What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might
   encounter the thing. No sane person had ever seen it, and few had ever
   felt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and
   outside the realm of substance--or it might be partly material; some
   unknown and equivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will
   to nebulous approximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously
   unparticled states. The anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor, the
   form of the yellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in
   some of the old tales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent
   connection with the human shape; but how representative or permanent
   that similarity might be, none could say with any kind of certainty.

   We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted
   Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with
   peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and
   opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair
   of military flame-throwers of the sort used in the World War, in case
   it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical
   destruction--for like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were
   prepared to burn the thing's heart out if heart existed to burn. All
   this aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully
   arranged with reference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before
   the fireplace where the mold had taken strange shapes. That suggestive
   patch, by the way. was only faintly visible when we placed our
   furniture and instruments, and when we returned that evening for the
   actual vigil. For a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in
   the more definitely limned form--but then I thought of the legends.

   Our cellar vigil began at ten p. m., daylight saving time, and as it
   continued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,
   filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble
   phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, showed the dripping
   stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished;
   the dank, fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene
   fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables,
   and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams
   of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins
   and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone
   staircase with ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous
   fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the
   pasrpresence of hooks, and irons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch
   oven--these things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy
   and intricate destructive machinery we had brought.

   We had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the street
   unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open
   in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our
   idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever
   malign entity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose
   of the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we
   had recognized and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require
   to evoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us,
   too, that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thing
   might appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game worth the
   hazard, and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the
   seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps
   defeat our entire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked--far
   into the night, till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him
   to He down for his two-hour sleep.

   Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours
   alone--I say lone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;
   perhaps more alone than he can realize. My uncle breathed heavily, his
   deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and
   punctuated by another nerve--racking sound of distant dripping water
   within--for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in
   this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose. antique masonry
   of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in
   from the street through the screened window; and once, when the noisome
   atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door
   and looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights
   and my nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my
   watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of
   apprehension.

   Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had
   turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of
   the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity,
   occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities
   of a choking moan.

   I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so
   rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the
   light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most
   surprizingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been
   merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature
   of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in
   itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facial
   expression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our
   situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at
   all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly
   and well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling
   within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which
   chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing
   perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one
   but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.

   All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his
   mouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable,
   and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them
   which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's
   education and the interminable translations he had made from
   anthropological and antiquarian articles in the Revue des Deux Mondes.
   For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering in French, and the few
   phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he
   had ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine.

   Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he
   leaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry
   in English, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, "My breath, my
   breath!" Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of
   facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began
   to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise
   with a kind of awe.

   He had, he said, floated oif from a very ordinary series of
   dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he
   had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy
   geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar
   things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a
   suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon
   another; an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of
   space seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this
   kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots,
   if one might use the term, of singular clearness but unaccountable
   heterogeneity.

   Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd
   of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats
   frowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of a
   house--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants were
   constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the
   furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed
   in just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects.
   It was queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as
   if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the
   strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris
   family. And all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as
   if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and
   sought to possess itself of his vital processes.

   I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were
   by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown
   forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;
   but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that
   these uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle's
   reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled
   our minds to the exclusion of all else.

   Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and
   in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle
   seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even
   though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his alotted two
   hours.

   Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the
   most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal
   loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where
   I lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing
   yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle's face
   came to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours, and I
   recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a
   pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek
   which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and
   startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood
   out with more than natural clearness and reality.

                                      5

   I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in
   this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the
   window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the
   room, all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light
   brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street
   outside. It was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly
   not nearly strong enough to read an average book by. But it cast a
   shadow of myself and the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish,
   penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity.
   This I perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of
   my other senses were violently assailed. For on my ears rang the
   reverberations of that shocking scream, while my nostrils revolted at
   the stench which filled the place. My mind, as alert as my senses,
   recognized the gravely unusual; and almost automatically I leaped up
   and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left
   trained on the moldy spot before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded
   what I was to see; for the scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I
   knew not against what menace I should have to defend him and myself.

   Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are
   horrors beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all
   dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and
   unhappy few. Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous
   corpse-light, yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a
   gigantic height in vague outlines half human and half monstrous,
   through which I could see the chimney and fireplace beyond. It was all
   eyes--wolfish and mocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at
   the top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and
   finally vanished up the chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is
   only in conscious retrospection that I ever definitely traced its
   damnable approach to form. At the time, it was to me only a seething,
   dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and
   dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my
   attention was focussed. That object was my uncle--the venerable Elihu
   Whipple--who with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered
   at me, and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this
   horror had brought.

   It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled
   myself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved
   me. Recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter
   or material chemistry, and therefore ignoring the flame-thrower which
   loomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube
   apparatus, and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness
   the strongest ether radiations which man's art can arouse from the
   spaces and fluids of nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied
   sputtering, and the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes.
   But I saw the dimness was only that of contrast, and that the waves
   from the machine had no effect whatever.

   Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror
   which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering
   toward that unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what
   abnormal terrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments
   of men I brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and
   yellow the form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose
   essence eludes all description, and in which there played across his
   vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive.
   He was at once a devil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant.
   Lit by the mixed and uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a
   dozen--a score--a hundred--aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground
   on a body that melted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of
   legions strange and yet not strange.

   I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult
   and infantile, and other features old and young, coarse and refined,
   familiar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded
   counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in
   the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the
   raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in
   Carrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; toward
   the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered
   close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was
   spreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought against
   themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly
   face. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried
   to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own
   parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of
   grease following me through the door to the rain-drenched sidewalk.

   The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking
   street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked
   aimlessly south past College Hill and the Athenæum, down Hopkins
   Street, and over the bridge to the business section where tall
   buildings seemed to guard me as modern material things guard the world
   from ancient and unwholesome wonder. Then gray dawn unfolded wetly from
   the east, silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples, and
   beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished.
   And in the end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light,
   and entered that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar,
   and which still swung cryptically in full sight of the early
   householders to whom I dared not speak.

   The grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of
   the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form traced in
   niter. I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected
   hat, and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost,
   and I could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then
   thought trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more
   horrible than I had dreamed. Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as
   nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened, and how I might
   end the horror, if indeed it had been real. Matter it seemed not to be,
   nor ether, nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind. What, then,
   but some exotic emanation; some vampirish vapor such as Exeter rustics
   tell of as lurking over certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue,
   and again I looked at the floor before the fireplace where the mold and
   niter had taken strange forms.

   In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for
   home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,
   a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to
   be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house
   in Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the
   hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract
   my mood.

   At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,
   and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the
   unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling
   anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because
   he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so
   little toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front
   of the fireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from
   the white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of
   what I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for
   mankind, and this seemed to me one of them.

   My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing
   in the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was
   about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt
   of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had
   cursed the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it
   would look like--what its form and substance would be, and how big it
   might have waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed
   out of the hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the
   great carboys of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary
   I might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession. After
   that I dumped earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly
   and donning my gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my
   proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.

   Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and
   made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as
   my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the
   light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was
   fishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with
   suggestions of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had
   form. There was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over.
   The exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft
   blue-white stovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in
   diameter. Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the
   hole and away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting
   the heavy carboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after
   another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality
   whose titan elbow I had seen.

   The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapor which surged
   tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will
   never leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow
   day, when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste
   dumped in the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to
   the source. They tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the same time
   came from some disordered water-pipe or gas main underground^but again
   I could correct them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do
   not see how I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth
   carboy, which I had to handle after the fumes had began to penetrate my
   mask; but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh
   vapors.

   The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and
   after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It
   was twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The
   dampness was less fetid, and all the strange fungi had withered to a
   kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor.
   One of earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there
   be a hell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed
   thing. And as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first
   of the many tears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my
   beloved uncle's memory.

   The next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the
   shunned house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carrington
   Harris rented the place. It is still spectral, but its strangeness
   fascinates me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret
   when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment
   building. The barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small,
   sweet apples, and last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs.

   The Silver Key
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   8524The Silver KeyH. P. Lovecraft

   When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams.
   Prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly
   excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely,
   unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age
   hardened upon him he felt those liberties slipping away little by
   little, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could his
   galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or
   his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where
   forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken
   under the moon.
         He had read much of things as they are, and talked with too many
   people. Well-meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the
   logical relations of things, and analyse the processes which shaped his
   thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that
   all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is
   no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of
   inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other. Custom
   had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which
   tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to
   dwell in visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and
   childish, and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying
   them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly
   on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again,
   neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of the minds that
   flicker for a second now and then in the darkness.
         They had chained him down to things that are, and had then
   explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the
   world. When he complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms
   where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized
   associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and
   unquenchable delight, they turned him instead toward the new-found
   prodigies of science, bidding him find wonder in the atom's vortex and
   mystery in the sky's dimensions. And when he had failed to find these
   boons in things whose laws are known and measurable, they told him he
   lacked imagination, and was immature because he preferred
   dream-illusions to the illusions of our physical creation.
         So Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the
   common events and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the
   fantasies of rare and delicate souls. He did not dissent when they told
   him that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real
   life is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of Narath with its
   hundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony, which he dimly remembered
   from his dreams; and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking
   sense of pity and tragedy.
         Once in a while, though, he could not help seeing how shallow,
   fickle, and meaningless all human aspirations are, and how emptily our
   real impulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold.
   Then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him
   to use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw
   that the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and
   artificial, and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in
   beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and
   purpose. In this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see
   that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true
   standard of consistency or inconsistency.
         In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle
   churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers, for
   thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from
   life. Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the
   stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims
   of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most
   of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it
   sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of
   a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how
   solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which
   every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced
   seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient
   creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional
   outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy.
         But when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths,
   he found them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not know
   that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no
   standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams
   and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little
   spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and evil
   and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective,
   whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers
   think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race
   and culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or
   transferred them to the crude, vague instincts which they shared with
   the beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously
   out in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous
   pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which
   still held them. They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety
   for those of license and anarchy.
         Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their
   cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone while his
   reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to
   gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had
   discarded. He saw that most of them, in common with their cast-off
   priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning
   apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the
   crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even
   when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal
   unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries. Warped and
   bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and
   consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old way with the old
   beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were
   the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole
   guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or
   stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings,
   their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at
   length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended
   usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal
   sensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous
   through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found
   fault with the social order. Never could they realize that their brute
   foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their
   elders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the
   next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in a dream, and this solace the
   world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the
   secrets of childhood and innocence.
         Amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live
   as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams
   fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything,
   but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and
   station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed
   because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow
   sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the
   first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once
   known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew
   how to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred
   him but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion
   of France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the
   crudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their
   visions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and
   out of touch with him, for they would not have understood his mental
   life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher
   could, and they were long dead.
         Then he began once more the writing of books, which he had left
   off when dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no
   satisfaction or fulfillment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind,
   and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic
   humor dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy
   fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in
   his faery gardens. The convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on
   his characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant
   human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled
   allegory and cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his
   old ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to
   please an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing. They were
   very graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he
   lightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all
   their life away.
         It was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and
   dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote
   for the commonplace. Most of these, however, soon showed their poverty
   and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are
   as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender
   palliative of truth to redeem them. Gross stupidity, falsehood, and
   muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind
   trained above their own level. So Carter bought stranger books and
   sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving
   into arcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things
   about the secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which
   disturbed him ever afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and
   furnished his Boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for
   each, hung in appropriate colours, furnished with befitting books and
   objects, and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light,
   heat, sound, taste, and odour.
         Once he heard of a man in the south, who was shunned and feared
   for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay
   tablets smuggled from India and Arabia. Him he visited, living with him
   and sharing his studies for seven years, till horror overtook them one
   midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard, and only one emerged
   where two had entered. Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible
   witch-haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, and had
   experiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel
   roofs, which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a
   wild-minded ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of
   reality, and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth;
   so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world
   grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dreams.
         Having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real
   things, Carter spent his days in retirement, and in wistful disjointed
   memories of his dream-filled youth. He thought it rather silly that he
   bothered to keep on living at all, and got from a South American
   acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without
   suffering. Inertia and force of habit, however, caused him to defer
   action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times,
   taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house
   as it was in his early boyhood - purple panes, Victorian furniture, and
   all.
         With the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered,
   for his relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and
   sophistication seem very distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of
   magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers. For years
   those slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of every-day
   things as the commonest slumbers know, but now there returned a flicker
   of something stranger and wilder; something of vaguely awesome
   imminence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his
   childhood days, and made him think of little inconsequential things he
   had long forgotten. He would often awake calling for his mother and
   grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century.
         Then one night his grandfather reminded him of the key. The grey
   old scholar, as vivid as in life, spoke long and earnestly of their
   ancient line, and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive
   men who composed it. He spoke of the flame-eyed Crusader who learnt
   wild secrets of the Saracens that held him captive; and of the first
   Sir Randolph Carter who studied magic when Elizabeth was queen. He
   spoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped hanging in the
   Salem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver
   key handed down from his ancestors. Before Carter awaked, the gentle
   visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of
   archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two
   centuries.
         In the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote
   and forgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest. It was about a
   foot square, and its Gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not
   marvel no person since Edmund Carter had dared to open it. It gave
   forth no noise when shaken, but was mystic with the scent of
   unremembered spices. That it held a key was indeed only a dim legend,
   and Randolph Carter's father had never known such a box existed. It was
   bound in rusty iron, and no means was provided for working the
   formidable lock. Carter vaguely understood that he would find within it
   some key to the lost gate of dreams, but of where and how to use it his
   grandfather had told him nothing.
         An old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the
   hideous faces leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced
   familiarity. Inside, wrapped in a discoloured parchment, was a huge key
   of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any
   legible explanation there was none. The parchment was voluminous, and
   held only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an
   antique reed. Carter recognized the characters as those he had seen on
   a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the
   South who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery. The man had
   always shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now.
         But he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its
   aromatic box of ancient oak. His dreams were meanwhile increasing in
   vividness, and though showing him none of the strange cities and
   incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose
   purpose could not be mistaken. They were calling him back along the
   years, and with the mingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him
   toward some hidden and ancestral source. Then he knew he must go into
   the past and merge himself with old things, and day after day he
   thought of the hills to the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing
   Miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay.
         In the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way
   past graceful lines of rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant
   vale and hanging woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the
   crystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic
   bridges of wood or stone. At one bend he saw the group of giant elms
   among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before,
   and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them. Then there was
   the crumbling farmhouse of old Goody Fowler the witch, with its little
   evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north
   side. He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not slacken till
   he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her
   were born, and where the old white house still looked proudly across
   the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant
   valley, with the distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints
   of the archaic, dream-laden sea in the farthest background.
         Then came the steeper slope that held the old Carter place he had
   not seen in over forty years. Afternoon was far gone when he reached
   the foot, and at the bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread
   countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured
   out by a western sun. All the strangeness and expectancy of his recent
   dreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape, and he
   thought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced
   out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their
   tumbled walls, and clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of
   purple hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down
   in shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled
   among swollen and distorted roots.
         Something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm
   he was seeking, so he left his car at the edge of the forest, and
   putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill. Woods
   now engulfed him utterly, though he knew the house was on a high knoll
   that cleared the trees except to the north. He wondered how it would
   look, for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect
   since the death of his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years
   before. In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and
   had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard.
         Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap
   in the trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues
   of twilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central
   Hill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the
   little round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in
   deep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have
   come from childish memory alone, since the old white church had long
   been torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had
   read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange
   burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath.
         Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its
   familiarity after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle
   Christopher's hired man, and was aged even in those far-off times of
   his boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping
   voice could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet
   the tone was haunting and unmistakable. To think that "Old Benijy"
   should still be alive!
         "Mister Randy! Mister Randy! Wharbe ye? D'ye want to skeer yer
   Aunt Marthy plumb to death? Hain't she tuld ye to keep nigh the place
   in the arternoon an' git back afur dark? Randy! Ran... dee!... He's the
   beatin'est boy fer runnin' off in the woods I ever see; haff the time
   a-settin' moonin' raound that snake-den in the upper timberlot! ... Hey
   yew, Ran ... dee!"
         Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand
   across his eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought
   not to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not
   belonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on
   the Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with his
   pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange
   and unprecedented. He was not sure he had his little telescope with
   him, and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see. No, it was not
   there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box
   somewhere. Uncle Chris had told him something odd once about an old
   unopened box with a key in it, but Aunt Martha had stopped the story
   abruptly, saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was
   already too full of queer fancies. He tried to recall just where he had
   found the key, but something seemed very confused. He guessed it was in
   the attic at home in Boston, and dimly remembered bribing Parks with
   half his week's allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet about
   it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very
   strangely, as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk
   little Cockney.
         "Ran ... dee! Ran ... dee! Hi! Hi! Randy!"
         A swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah
   pounced on the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim.
         "Durn ye, boy, so thar ye be! Ain't ye got a tongue in yer head,
   that ye can't answer a body! I ben callin' this haff hour, an' ye must
   a heerd me long ago! Dun't ye know yer Aunt Marthy's all a-fidget over
   yer bein' off arter dark? Wait till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he gits
   hum! Ye'd orta know these here woods ain't no fitten place to be
   traipsin' this hour! They's things abroad what dun't do nobody no good,
   as my gran'-sir knowed afur me. Come, Mister Randy, or Hannah wunt keep
   supper no longer!"
         So Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars
   glimmered through high autumn boughs. And dogs barked as the yellow
   light of small-paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the
   Pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof
   stood black against the dim west. Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and
   did not scold too hard when Benijah shoved the truant in. She knew
   Uncle Chris well enough to expect such things of the Carter blood.
   Randolph did not show his key, but ate his supper in silence and
   protested only when bedtime came. He sometimes dreamed better when
   awake, and he wanted to use that key.
         In the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to
   the upper timberlot if Uncle Chris had not caught him and forced him
   into his chair by the breakfast table. He looked impatiently around the
   low-pitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and
   corner-posts, and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the
   leaded panes of the rear window. The trees and the hills were close to
   him, and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his true
   country.
         Then, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key;
   and being reassured, skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond,
   where the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless
   knoll. The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and great
   lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like Druid
   monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove. Once
   in his ascent Randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little
   way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and aegipans and
   dryads.
         Then he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded
   "snake-den" which country folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had
   warned him again and again. It was deep; far deeper than anyone but
   Randolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost
   black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond - a haunting
   sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of
   conscious artifice. On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting
   his way with matches filched from the sitting-room matchsafe, and
   edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even
   to himself. He could not tell why he approached the farther wall so
   confidently, or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as
   he did so. But on he went, and when he danced back to the house that
   night he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in the least
   the reproofs he gained for ignoring the noon-tide dinner-horn
   altogether.
         Now it is agreed by all the distant relatives of Randolph Carter
   that something occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year.
   His cousin, Ernest B. Aspinwall, Esq., of Chicago, is fully ten years
   his senior; and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn
   of 1883. Randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can
   ever have beheld, and stranger still were some of the qualities which
   he showed in relation to very mundane things. He seemed, in fine, to
   have picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to things
   which, though at the time without meaning, were later found to justify
   the singular impressions. In subsequent decades as new inventions, new
   names, and new events appeared one by one in the book of history,
   people would now and then recall wonderingly how Carter had years
   before let fall some careless word of undoubted connection with what
   was then far in the future. He did not himself understand these words,
   or know why certain things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied
   that some unremembered dream must be responsible. It was as early as
   1897 that he turned pale when some traveller mentioned the French town
   of Belloy-en-Santerre, and friends remembered it when he was almost
   mortally wounded there in 1916, while serving with the Foreign Legion
   in the Great War.
         Carter's relatives talk much of these things because he has
   lately disappeared. His little old servant Parks, who for years bore
   patiently with his vagaries, last saw him on the morning he drove off
   alone in his car with a key he had recently found. Parks had helped him
   get the key from the old box containing it, and had felt strangely
   affected by the grotesque carvings on the box, and by some other odd
   quality he could not name. When Carter left, he had said he was going
   to visit his old ancestral country around Arkham.
         Half way up Elm Mountain, on the way to the ruins of the old
   Carter place, they found his motor set carefully by the roadside; and
   in it was a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the
   countrymen who stumbled on it. The box held only a queer parchment
   whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher
   or identify. Rain had long effaced any possible footprints, though
   Boston investigators had something to say about evidences of
   disturbances among the fallen timbers of the Carter place. It was, they
   averred, as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant
   period. A common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the
   hillside beyond cannot be identified as belonging to the missing man.
         There is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter's estate among his
   heirs, but I shall stand firmly against this course because I do not
   believe he is dead. There are twists of time and space, of vision and
   reality, which only a dreamer can divine; and from what I know of
   Carter I think he has merely found a way to traverse these mazes.
   Whether or not he will ever come back, I cannot say. He wanted the
   lands of dream he had lost, and yearned for the days of his childhood.
   Then he found a key, and I somehow believe he was able to use it to
   strange advantage.
         I shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly
   in a certain dream-city we both used to haunt. It is rumoured in
   Ulthar, beyond the River Skai, that a new king reigns on the opal
   throne of Ilek-Vad, that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow
   cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and
   finny Gnorri build their singular labyrinths, and I believe I know how
   to interpret this rumour. Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the
   sight of that great silver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there
   may stand symbolised all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal
   cosmos.

The Slaying of the Monster

   1364032The Slaying of the Monsterby H. P. Lovecraft and R. H.
   Barlow1933

   Great was the clamour in Laen; for smoke had been spied in the Hills of
   the Dragon. That surely meant the Stirrings of the Monster--the Monster
   who spat lava and shook the earth as he writhed in its depths. And when
   the men of Laen spoke together they swore to slay the Monster and keep
   his fiery breath from searing their minaret-studded city and toppling
   their alabaster domes.

   So it was that by torch-light gathered fully a hundred of the little
   people, prepared to battle the Evil One in his hidden fast-hold. With
   the coming of night they began marching in ragged columns into the
   foot-hills beneath the fulgent lunar rays. Ahead a burning cloud shone
   clearly through the purple dusk, a guide to their goal.

   For the sake of truth it is to be recorded that their spirits sank low
   long ere they sighted the foe, and as the moon grew dim and the coming
   of the dawn was heralded by gaudy clouds they wished themselves more
   than ever at home, dragon or no dragon. But as the sun rose they
   cheered up slightly, and shifting their spears, resolutely trudged the
   remaining distance.

   Clouds of sulphurous smoke hung pall-like over the world, darkening
   even the new-risen sun, and always replenished by sullen puffs from the
   mouth of the Monster. Little tongues of hungry flame made the Laenians
   move swiftly over the hot stones. "But where is the dragon??" whispered
   one--fearfully and hoping it would not accept the query as an
   invitation. In vain they looked--there was nothing solid enough to
   slay.

   So shouldering their weapons, they wearily returned home and there set
   up a stone tablet graven to this effect--"BEING TROUBLED BY A FIERCE
   MONSTER THE BRAVE CITIZENS OF LAEN DID SET UPON IT AND SLAY IT IN ITS
   FEARFUL LAIR SAVING THE LAND FROM A DREADFUL DOOM." These words were
   hard to read when we dug that stone from its deep, ancient layers of
   encrusting lava.

The Sorcery of Aphlar

   The Sorcery of Aphlar
   by Duane W. Rimel
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   1347100The Sorcery of AphlarDuane W. Rimel

   The council of twelve seated on the jewelled celestial dais ordered
   that Aphlar be cast from the gates of Bel-haz-en. He sat too much
   alone, they decreed, and brooded when toil should have been his lot.
   And in his obscure and hidden delvings he read all too frequently those
   papyri of Elder æons which reposed in the Guothic shrine and were to be
   consulted only for rare and special purposes.

   The twilight city of Bel-haz-en had climbed backward in its knowledge.
   No longer did philosophers sit upon street corners speaking wise words
   to the populace, for stupid ignorance ruled within the crumbling and
   immemorially ancient walls. Where once the wisdom of the stars
   abounded, only feebleness and desolation now lay upon the place,
   spreading like a monstrous blight and sucking foul nurture from the
   stupid dwellers. And out of the waters of the Oll that meandered from
   the mountains of Azlakka to pass by the aged city, there rose often
   great clouds of pestilence that racked the people sorely, leaving them
   pale and near to dying. All this their loss of wisdom brought. And now
   the council had sent their last and greatest wise man from them.

   Aphlar wandered to the mountains far above the city and built a cavern
   for protection from the summer heat and winter chill. There he read his
   scrolls in silence and told his mighty wisdom to the wind about the
   crags and to the swallows on the wing. All day he sat and watched below
   or drew queer drawings on small bits of stone and chanted to them, for
   he knew that someday men would seek the cave and slay him. The cunning
   of the twelve did not mislead him. Had not the last exiled wise man's
   screams rent the night two moon-rounds before when people thought him
   safely gone? Had not his own eyes seen the priest's sword-slashed form
   floating by in the poison waters? He knew no lion had killed old Azik,
   let the council say what they might. Does a lion slash with a sword and
   leave his prey uneaten?

   Through many seasons Aphlar sat upon the mountain, gazing at the muddy
   Oll as it wound into the misty distance to the land where none ever
   ventured. He spoke his words of wisdom to the snails that worked in the
   ground by his feet. They seemed to understand, and waved their slimy
   feelers before they sank beneath the sand again. On moonlit nights he
   climbed the hill above his cave and made strange offerings to the
   moon-God Ale; arid when the night-birds heard the sound they drew close
   and listened to the whispering. And when queer winged things flapped
   across the darkened sky and loomed up dimly against the moon Aphlar was
   content. Those which he had addressed had heeded his beckoning. His
   thoughts were always far away, and his prayers were offered to the pale
   fancies of dusk.

   Then one day past noontide Aphlar rose from his earthen chair and
   strode down the rock mountainside. His eyes, heeding not the rotten,
   stone-walled city, held steadfast to the river. When he drew near its
   muddy brink he paused and looked up the bosom of the stream. A small
   object floated near the rushes, and this Aphlar rescued with tender and
   curious care. Then, wrapping the thing in the folds of his robe, he
   climbed up again to his cave in the hills. All day he sat and gazed
   upon the object; rummaging now and then in his musty chronicles, and
   muttering awful syllables as he drew faint figures on a piece of
   parchment.

   That night the gibbous moon rose high, but Aphlar did not climb above
   his dwelling. Queer night-birds flew past the cavern's mouth, chirped
   eerily, and fled away into the shadows.

   Many days passed before the council sent their messengers of murder;
   but at last the time was thought ripe, and seven darkbrowed men stole
   away to the hills. Yet when that grim seven ventured within the cave
   they saw not the wise man Aphlar. Instead, small blades of grass were
   sprouting in his natural chair of earth. All about lay papyri dim and
   musty, with faint figures drawn upon them. The seven shuddered and left
   forthwith when they beheld these things, but as the last man
   tremblingly withdrew he saw a round and unknown thing lying on the
   ground. He picked it up, and his fellows drew close in curiosity; but
   they saw upon it only alien symbols which they could not read, yet
   which made them shrink and quaver without knowing why. Then he who had
   found it cast it quickly over the steep precipice beside him, but no
   sound came from the slope below whereon it should have fallen. And the
   thrower trembled, fearing many things that are not known but only
   whispered about. Then, when he told how the sphere he had held was
   without the weight a thing of stone should have; how it was like to
   have floated on air as the thistledown floats; he and the six with him
   slunk as one from the spot and swore it was a place accursed.

   But after they had gone a snail crawled slowly from a sandy crevice and
   slid intently over to where the blades of grass were growing. And when
   it reached the spot, two slimy feelers stretched forth and bent oddly
   downward, as if eager to watch forever the winding river.

   The Statement of Randolph Carter

   by H. P. Lovecraft

   Telling ghost stories in dark and lonely places is an honored
   tradition. As a rule such tales, recited from memory, are not the type
   that make for literature--they are terse, grim, and usually described
   as true occurrences. The works of the "greats" of modern fantasy--save
   perhaps for Ambrose Bierce--are not easily adapted to such recitation;
   they are too complex or too esoteric. But here is an H. P. Lovecraft
   tale that lends itself to recitation. Not word for word, but the plot
   idea is one to be worked into a midnight tale. Your editor has related
   it several times--usually on deserted rural roads--with marked effect.

   I repeat to you gentlemen, that your inquisition is fruitless. Detain
   me here for ever if you will; confine or execute me if you must have a
   victim to propitiate the illusion you call justice; but I can say no
   more than I have said already. Everything that I can remember, I have
   told with perfect candor. Nothing has been distorted or concealed, and
   if anything remains vague, it is only because of the dark cloud which
   has come over my mind--that cloud and the nebulous nature of the
   horrors which brought it upon me.

   Again I say, I do not know what has become of Harley Warren, though I
   think--almost hope--that he is in peaceful oblivion, if there be
   anywhere so blessed a thing. It is true that I have for five years been
   his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches
   into the unknown. I will not deny, though my memory is uncertain and
   indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he
   says, on the Gainsville pike, walking toward Big Cypress Swamp, at half
   past eleven on that awful night. That we bore electric lanterns,
   spades, and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments, I will
   even affirm; for these things all played a part in the single hideous
   scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection. But of what
   followed, and of the reason I was found alone and dazed on the edge of
   the swamp next morning, I must insist that I know nothing save what I
   have told you over and over again. You say to me that there is nothing
   in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful
   episode. I reply that I knew nothing beyond what I saw. Vision or
   nightmare it may have been--vision or nightmare I fervently hope it
   was--yet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those
   shocking hours after we left the sight of men. And why Harley Warren
   did not return, he or his shade--or some nameless thing I cannot
   describe--alone can tell.

   As I have said before, the weird studies of Harley Warren were well
   known to me, and to some extent shared by me. Of his vast collection of
   strange, rare books on forbidden subjects I have read all that are
   written in the languages of which I am master; but these are few as
   compared with those in languages I cannot understand. Most, I believe,
   are in Arabic; and the fiend-inspired book which brought on the
   end--the book which he carried in his pocket out of the world--was
   written in characters whose like I never saw elsewhere. Warren would
   never tell me just what was in that book. As to the nature of our
   studies--must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension?
   It seems to me rather merciful that I do not, for they were terrible
   studies, which I pursued more through reluctant fascination than
   through actual inclination. Warren always dominated me, and sometimes I
   feared him. I remember how I shuddered at his facial expression on the
   night before the awful happening, when he talked so incessantly of his
   theory, why certain corpses never decay, but rest firm and fat in their
   tombs for a thousand years. But I do not fear him now, for I suspect
   that he has known horrors beyond my ken. Now I fear for him.

   Once more I say that I have no clear idea of our object on that night.
   Certainly, it had much to do with something in the book which Warren
   carried with him--that ancient book in undecipherable characters which
   had come to him from India a month before--but I swear I do not know
   what it was that we expected to find. Your witness says he saw us at
   half past eleven on the Gainsville pike, headed for Big Cypress Swamp.
   This is probably true, but I have no distinct memory of it. The picture
   seared into my soul is of one scene only, and the hour must have been
   long after midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the
   vaporous heavens.

   The place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I trembled at the
   manifold signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp hollow,
   overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled
   with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with
   rotting stone. On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude,
   and I seemed haunted by the notion that Warren and I were the first
   living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries. Over the
   valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome
   vapors that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs, and by its
   feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique
   slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausoleum facades; all crumbling,
   moss-grown, and moisture-stained, and partly concealed by the gross
   luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation.

   My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible
   necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain
   half-obliterated sepulcher and of throwing down some burdens which we
   seemed to have been carrying. I now observed that I had with me an
   electric lantern and two spades, whilst my companion was supplied with
   a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit. No word was uttered,
   for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without delay we
   seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass, weeds, and
   drifted earth from the flat, archaic mortuary. After uncovering the
   entire surface, which consisted of three immense granite slabs, we
   stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene; and Warren
   appeared to make some mental calculations. Then he returned to the
   sepulcher, and using his spade as a lever, sought to pry up the slab
   lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its
   day. He did not succeed, and motioned to me to come to his assistance.
   Finally our combined strength loosened the stone, which we raised and
   tipped to one side.

   The removal of the slab revealed a black aperture, from which rushed an
   effluence of miasmal gases so nauseous that we started back in horror.
   After an interval, however, we approached the pit again, and found the
   exhalations less unbearable. Our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight
   of stone steps, dripping with some detestable ichor of the inner earth,
   and bordered by moist walls encrusted with niter. And now for the first
   time my memory records verbal discourse, Warren addressing me at length
   in his mellow tenor voice; a voice singularly unperturbed by our
   awesome surroundings.

   "I'm sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface," he said, "but it
   would be a crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there.
   You can't imagine, even from what you have read and from what I've told
   you, the things I shall have to see and do. It's fiendish work, Carter,
   and I doubt if any man without ironclad sensibilities could ever see it
   through and come up alive and sane. I don't wish to offend you, and
   Heaven knows I'd be glad enough to have you with me; but the
   responsibility is in a certain sense mine, and I couldn't drag a bundle
   of nerves like you down to probable death or madness. I tell you, you
   can't imagine what the thing is really like! But I promise to keep you
   informed over the telephone of every move--you see I've enough wire
   here to reach to the center of the earth and back!"

   I can still hear, in memory, those coolly spoken words; and I can still
   remember my remonstrances. I seemed desperately anxious to accompany my
   friend into those sepulchral depths, yet he proved inflexibly obdurate.
   At one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if I remained
   insistent; a threat which proved effective, since he alone held the key
   to the thing. All this I can still remember, though I no longer know
   what manner of thing we sought. After he had obtained my reluctant
   acquiescence in his design, Warren picked up the reel of wire and
   adjusted the instruments. At his nod I took one of the latter and
   seated myself upon an aged, discolored gravestone close by the newly
   uncovered aperture. Then he shook my hand, shouldered the coil of wire,
   and disappeared within that indescribable ossuary.

   For a minute I kept sight of the glow of his lantern, and heard the
   rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him; but the glow soon
   disappeared abruptly, as if a turn in the stone staircase had been
   encountered, and the sound died away almost as quickly. I was alone,
   yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated
   surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent
   moon.

   In the lone silence of that hoary and deserted city of the dead, my
   mind conceived the most ghastly fantasies and illusions; and the
   grotesque shrines and monoliths seemed to assume a hideous
   personality--a half-sentience. Amorphous shadows seemed to lurk in the
   darker recesses of the weed-choked hollow and to flit as in some
   blasphemous ceremonial procession past the portals of the mouldering
   tombs in the hillside; shadows which could not have been cast by that
   pallid, peering crescent moon.

   I constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern,
   and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone;
   but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing. Then a faint
   clicking came from the instrument, and I called down to my friend in a
   tense voice. Apprehensive as I was, I was nevertheless unprepared for
   the words which came up from that uncanny vault in accents more alarmed
   and quivering than any I had heard before from Harley Warren. He who
   had so calmly left me a little while previously, now called from below
   in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriek:

   "God! If you could see what I am seeing!"

   I could not answer. Speechless, I could only wait. Then came the
   frenzied tones again:

   "Carter, it's terrible--monstrous--unbelievable!"

   This time my voice did not fail me, and I poured into the transmitter a
   flood of excited questions. Terrified, I continued to repeat, "Warren,
   what is it? What is it?"

   Once more came the voice of my friend, still hoarse with fear, and now
   apparently tinged with despair:

   "I can't tell you, Carter! It's too utterly beyond thought--I dare not
   tell you--no man could know it and live--Great God! I never dreamed of
   this!"

   Stillness again, save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering
   inquiry. Then the voice of Warren in a pitch of wilder consternation:

   "Carter! for the love of God, put back the slab and get out of this if
   you can! Quick!--leave everything else and make for the outside--it's
   your only chance! Do as I say, and don't ask me to explain!"

   I heard, yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions. Around me
   were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows; below me, some peril
   beyond the radius of the human imagination. But my friend was in
   greater danger than I, and through my fear I felt a vague resentment
   that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such
   circumstances. More clicking, and after a pause a piteous cry from
   Warren:

   "Beat it! For God's sake, put back the slab and beat it, Carter!"

   Something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion
   unleashed my faculties. I formed and shouted a resolution, "Warren,
   brace up! I'm coming down!" But at this offer the tone of my auditor
   changed to a scream of utter despair:

   "Don't! You can't understand! It's too late--and my own fault. Put back
   the slab and run--there's nothing else you or anyone can do now!"

   The tone changed again, this time acquiring a softer quality, as of
   hopeless resignation. Yet it remained tense through anxiety for me.

   "Quick--before it's too late!"

   I tried not to heed him; tried to break through the paralysis which
   held me, and to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid. But his next
   whisper found me still held inert in the chains of stark horror.

   "Carter--hurry! It's no use--you must go--better one than two--the
   slab--"

   A pause, more clicking, then the faint voice of Warren:

   "Nearly over now--don't make it harder--cover up those damned steps and
   run for your life--you're losing time--so long, Carter--won't see you
   again."

   Here Warren's whisper swelled into a cry; a cry that gradually rose to
   a shriek fraught with all the horror of the ages:

   "Curse these hellish things--legions--My God! Beat it! Beat it! BEAT
   IT!"

   After that was silence. I know not how many interminable eons I sat
   stupefied; whispering, muttering, calling, screaming into that
   telephone. Over and over again through those eons I whispered and
   muttered, called, shouted, and screamed, "Warren! Warren! Answer
   me--are you there?"

   And then there came to me the crowning horror of all--the unbelievable,
   unthinkable, almost unmentionable thing. I have said that eons seemed
   to elapse after Warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning, and
   that only my own cries now broke the hideous silence. But after a while
   there was a further clicking in the receiver, and I strained my ears to
   listen. Again I called down, "Warren, are you there?" and in answer
   heard the thing which has brought this cloud over my mind. I do not
   try, gentlemen, to account for that thing--that voice--nor can I
   venture to describe it in detail, since the first words took away my
   consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of
   my awakening in the hospital. Shall I say that the voice was deep;
   hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied? What shall
   I say? It was the end of my experience, and is the end of my story. I
   heard it, and knew no more--heard it as I sat petrified in that unknown
   cemetery in the hollow, amidst the crumbling stones and the falling
   tombs, the rank vegetation and the miasmal vapors--heard it well up
   from the innermost depths of that damnable open sepulcher as I watched
   amorphous, necrophagous shadows dance beneath an accursed waning moon.

   And this is what it said:

   "You fool, Warren is DEAD!"

   In the morning, mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond
   Kingsport. White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers
   the clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And
   later, in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds
   scatter bits of those dreams, that men shall not live without rumor of
   old strange secrets, and wonders that planets tell planets alone in the
   night. When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conchs in
   seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great
   eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on tile
   rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim
   of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether
   of faery.

   Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious,
   terrace on terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a gray
   frozen wind-cloud. Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in limitless
   space, for there the coast turns sharp where the great Miskatonic pours
   out of the plains past Arkham, bringing woodland legends and little
   quaint memories of New England's hills. The sea-folk of Kingsport look
   up at that cliff as other sea-folk look up at the pole-star, and time
   the night's watches by the way it hides or shows the Great Bear,
   Cassiopeia and the Dragon. Among them it is one with the firmament, and
   truly, it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun.

   Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque profile they call
   Father Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term "The Causeway";
   but this one they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese
   sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see
   it, and the old Yankees believe it would be a much graver matter than
   death to climb it, if indeed that were possible. Nevertheless there is
   an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the
   small-paned windows.

   The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells
   within who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and
   perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff's
   rim becomes the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the
   white aether of faery. This they tell from hearsay, for that forbidding
   crag is always unvisited, and natives dislike to train telescopes on
   it. Summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars, but
   have never seen more than the gray primeval roof, peaked and shingled,
   whose eaves come nearly to the gray foundations, and the dim yellow
   light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the
   dusk. These summer people do not believe that the same One has lived in
   the ancient house for hundreds of years, but can not prove their heresy
   to any real Kingsporter. Even the Terrible Old Man who talks to leaden
   pendulums in bottles, buys groceries with centuried Spanish gold, and
   keeps stone idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in Water
   Street can only say these things were the same when his grandfather was
   a boy, and that must have been inconceivable ages ago, when Belcher or
   Shirley or Pownall or Bernard was Governor of His Majesty's Province of
   the Massachusetts-Bay.

   Then one summer there came a philosopher into Kingsport. His name was
   Thomas Olney, and he taught ponderous things in a college by
   Narragansett Bay. With stout wife and romping children he came, and his
   eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many years, and
   thinking the same well-disciplined thoughts. He looked at the mists
   from the diadem of Father Neptune, and tried to walk into their white
   world of mystery along the titan steps of The Causeway. Morning after
   morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the world's rim at the
   cryptical aether beyond, listening to spectral bells and the wild cries
   of what might have been gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the
   sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers, he would sigh and
   descend to the town, where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up
   and down hill, and study the crazy tottering gables and odd-pillared
   doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy sea-folk.
   And he even talked with the Terrible Old Man, who was not fond of
   strangers, and was invited into his fearsomely archaic cottage where
   low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting
   soliloquies in the dark small hours.

   Of course it was inevitable that Olney should mark the gray unvisited
   cottage in the sky, on that sinister northward crag which is one with
   the mists and the firmament. Always over Kingsport it hung, and always
   its mystery sounded in whispers through Kingsport's crooked alleys. The
   Terrible Old Man wheezed a tale that his father had told him, of
   lightning that shot one night up from that peaked cottage to the clouds
   of higher heaven; and Granny Orne, whose tiny gambrel-roofed abode in
   Ship Street is all covered with moss and ivy, croaked over something
   her grandmother had heard at second-hand, about shapes that flapped out
   of the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that
   unreachable place - for the door is set close to the edge of the crag
   toward the ocean, and glimpsed only from ships at sea.

   At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither
   the Kingsporter's fear nor the summer boarder's usual indolence, Olney
   made a very terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training - or
   because of it, for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown
   - he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit
   the abnormally antique gray cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his
   saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached
   it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic's estuary.
   Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked
   their habitation or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the
   Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the
   great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things, and
   became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on
   that beetling southern slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet
   perpendicular from the water so only the western side, inland and
   toward Arkham, remained.

   One early morning in August Olney set out to find a path to the
   inaccessible pinnacle. He worked northwest along pleasant back roads,
   past Hooper's Pond and the old brick powder-house to where the pastures
   slope up to the ridge above the Miskatonic and give a lovely vista of
   Arkham's white Georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow.
   Here he found a shady road to Arkham, but no trail at all in the
   seaward direction he wished. Woods and fields crowded up to the high
   bank of the river's mouth, and bore not a sign of man's presence; not
   even a stone wall or a straying cow, but only the tall grass and giant
   trees and tangles of briars that the first Indian might have seen. As
   he climbed slowly east, higher and higher above the estuary on his left
   and nearer and nearer the sea, he found the way growing in difficulty
   till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed
   to reach the world outside, and whether they came often to market in
   Arkham.

   Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills
   and antique roofs and spires of Kingsport. Even Central Hill was a
   dwarf from this height, and he could just make out the ancient
   graveyard by the Congregational Hospital beneath which rumor said some
   terrible caves or burrows lurked. Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub
   blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the
   thin peak of the dreaded gray cottage. Now the ridge narrowed, and
   Olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky, south of him the frightful
   precipice above Kingsport, north of him the vertical drop of nearly a
   mile to the river's mouth. Suddenly a great chasm opened before him,
   ten feet deep, so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop
   to a slanting floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in
   the opposite wall. So this was the way the folk of the uncanny house
   journeyed betwixt earth and sky!

   When he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he
   clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as gray as
   the rock, and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the
   seaward vapors. And he perceived that there was no door on this
   landward end, but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy
   bull's-eye panes leaded in seventeenth century fashion. All around him
   was cloud and chaos, and he could see nothing below the whiteness of
   illimitable space. He was alone in the sky with this queer and very
   disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that
   the wall stood flush with the cliff's edge, so that the single narrow
   door was not to be reached save from the empty aether, he felt a
   distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain. And it was very
   odd that shingles so worm-eaten could survive, or bricks so crumbled
   still form a standing chimney.

   As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north
   and west and south sides, trying them but finding them all locked. He
   was vaguely glad they were locked, because the more he saw of that
   house the less he wished to get in. Then a sound halted him. He heard a
   lock rattle and a bolt shoot, and a long creaking follow as if a heavy
   door were slowly and cautiously opened. This was on the oceanward side
   that he could not see, where the narrow portal opened on blank space
   thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves.

   Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney
   heard the windows opening, first on the north side opposite him, and
   then on the west just around the corner. Next would come the south
   windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it
   must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the
   detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other.
   When a fumbling came in the nearer casements he crept around to the
   west again, flattening himself against the wall beside the now opened
   windows. It was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come
   from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined.
   Steps sounded again, and Olney edged round to the north; but before he
   could find a haven a voice called softly, and he knew he must confront
   his host.

   Stuck out of the west window was a great black-bearded face whose eyes
   were phosphorescent with the imprint of unheard-of sights. But the
   voice was gentle, and of a quaint olden kind, so that Olney did not
   shudder when a brown hand reached out to help him over the sill and
   into that low room of black oak wainscots and carved Tudor furnishings.
   The man was clad in very ancient garments, and had about him an
   unplaceable nimbus of sea-lore and dreams of tall galleons. Olney does
   not recall many of the wonders he told, or even who he was; but says
   that he was strange and kindly, and filled with the magic of unfathomed
   voids of time and space. The small room seemed green with a dim aqueous
   light, and Olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open,
   but shut against the misty aether with dull panes like the bottoms of
   old bottles.

   That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the
   elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvelous ancient things he
   related, it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying
   he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky
   ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from
   the plain below. And the day wore on, and still Olney listened to
   rumors of old times and far places, and heard how the kings of Atlantis
   fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in
   ocean's floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidon is
   still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who knew by its sight that
   they are lost. Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host grew
   timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or
   even the Elder Ones were born, and when the other gods came to dance on
   the peak of Hatheg-Kia in the stony desert near Ulthar, beyond the
   River Skai.

   It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that
   ancient door of nail-studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of
   white cloud. Olney started in fright, but the bearded man motioned him
   to be still, and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small
   peephole. What he saw he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his
   lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before
   returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney saw
   lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim
   windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved
   inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his host had not
   answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the great
   abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet
   the wrong ones.

   Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the
   table, and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the
   bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles
   in curiously wrought brass candle-sticks. Frequently he would glance at
   the door as if he expected some one, and at length his glance seemed
   answered by a singular rapping which must have followed some very
   ancient and secret code. This time he did not even glance through the
   peep-hole, but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt, unlatching
   the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist.

   And then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room
   from the deep all the dreams and memories of earth's sunken Mighty
   Ones. And golden flames played about weedy locks, so that Olney was
   dazzled as he did them homage. Trident-bearing Neptune was there, and
   sportive tritons and fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins' backs was
   balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the gay and awful form of
   primal Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. And the conchs of the tritons
   gave weird blasts, and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on
   the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black seacaves.
   Then hoary Nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped Olney and his
   host into the vast shell, whereat the conchs and the gongs set up a
   wild and awesome clamor. And out into the limitless aether reeled that
   fabulous train, the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of
   thunder.

   All night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and
   the mists gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the
   little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster. And
   Olney's children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of
   Baptists, and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and
   rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning. Then dawn swam dripping and
   mist-wreathed out of the sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices
   of white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney,
   dry and lightfooted, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport
   with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he
   had dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say
   how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he
   talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who
   afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the
   man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up,
   and that somewhere under that gray peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable
   reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost
   spirit of him who was Thomas Olney.

   And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of grayness and
   weariness, the philosopher has labored and eaten and slept and done
   uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen. Not any more does he
   long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like
   green reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer
   gives him sorrow and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for
   his imagination. His good wife waxes stouter and his children older and
   prosier and more useful, and he never fails to smile correctly with
   pride when the occasion calls for it. In his glance there is not any
   restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin
   horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering. He has never
   seen Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses and
   complained that the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim
   bungalow now at Bristol Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the
   neighbors are urban and modern.

   But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old
   Man admits a thing untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind
   sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is
   one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous, brooding
   silence ever before the bane of Kingsport's maritime cotters. And old
   folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that
   swells with joys beyond earth's joys; and say that at evening the
   little low windows are brighter than formerly. They say, too, that the
   fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north
   with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black
   and fantastic against wild coruscations. And the mists of the dawn are
   thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward
   ringing is that of the solemn buoys.

   Worst of all, though, is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of
   Kingsport's young men, who grow prone to listen at night to the north
   wind's faint distant sounds. They swear no harm or pain can inhabit
   that high peaked cottage, for in the new voices gladness beats, and
   with them the tinkle of laughter and music. What tales the sea-mists
   may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know,
   but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the
   cliff-yawning door when clouds are thickest. And patriarchs dread lest
   some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky,
   and learn what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof
   which is part of the rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of
   Kingsport. That those venturesome youths will come back they do not
   doubt, but they think a light may be gone from their eyes, and a will
   from their hearts. And they do not wish quaint Kingsport with its
   climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the years while
   voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that
   unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to
   rest on their way from the sea to the skies.

   They do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant
   hearths and gambrel-roofed taverns of old Kingsport, nor do they wish
   the laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder. For as
   the voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea and from
   the north fresh lights, so do they say that still other voices will
   bring more mists and more lights, till perhaps the olden gods (whose
   existence they hint only in whispers for fear the Congregational parson
   shall hear) may come out of the deep and from unknown Kadath in the
   cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so
   close to the gentle hills and valleys of quiet, simple fisher folk.
   This they do not wish, for to plain people things not of earth are
   unwelcome; and besides, the Terrible Old Man often recalls what Olney
   said about a knock that the lone dweller feared, and a shape seen black
   and inquisitive against the mist through those queer translucent
   windows of leaded bull's-eyes.

   All these things, however, the Elder Ones only may decide; and
   meanwhile the morning mist still comes up by that lovely vertiginous
   peak with the steep ancient house, that gray, low-eaved house where
   none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north
   wind tells of strange revels. White and feathery it comes from the deep
   to its brothers the clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves
   of leviathan. And when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and
   conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones,
   then great eager vapors flock to heaven laden with lore; and Kingsport,
   nestling uneasy in its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging
   sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness, as if the
   cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of the
   buoys tolled free in the aether of faery.

   8527The StreetH. P. Lovecraft

   There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be
   those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of
   the Street.

   Men of strength and honour fashioned that Street: good valiant men of
   our blood who had come from the Blessed Isles across the sea. At first
   it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring
   to the cluster of houses by the beach. Then, as more men came to the
   growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell, they
   built cabins along the north side, cabins of stout oaken logs with
   masonry on the side toward the forest, for many Indians lurked there
   with fire-arrows. And in a few years more, men built cabins on the
   south side of the Street.

   Up and down the Street walked grave men in conical hats, who most of
   the time carried muskets or fowling pieces. And there were also their
   bonneted wives and sober children. In the evening these men with their
   wives and children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak.
   Very simple were the things of which they read and spoke, yet things
   which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue
   the forest and till the fields. And the children would listen and learn
   of the laws and deeds of old, and of that dear England which they had
   never seen or could not remember.

   There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled the Street. The
   men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how
   to be. And the children grew up comfortable, and more families came
   from the Mother Land to dwell on the Street. And the children's
   children, and the newcomers' children, grew up. The town was now a
   city, and one by one the cabins gave place to houses--simple, beautiful
   houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron railings and
   fanlights over the doors. No flimsy creations were these houses, for
   they were made to serve many a generation. Within there were carven
   mantels and graceful stairs, and sensible, pleasing furniture, china,
   and silver, brought from the Mother Land.

   So the Street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its
   dwellers became more graceful and happy. Where once had been only
   strength and honour, taste and learning now abode as well. Books and
   paintings and music came to the houses, and the young men went to the
   university which rose above the plain to the north. In the place of
   conical hats and small-swords, of lace and snowy periwigs, there were
   cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many
   a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and
   hitching-posts.

   There were in that Street many trees: elms and oaks and maples of
   dignity; so that in the summer, the scene was all soft verdure and
   twittering bird-song. And behind the houses were walled rose-gardens
   with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars
   would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew.

   So the Street dreamed on, past wars, calamities, and change. Once, most
   of the young men went away, and some never came back. That was when
   they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars.
   But though men talked of great changes, the Street felt them not, for
   its folk were still the same, speaking of the old familiar things in
   the old familiar accounts. And the trees still sheltered singing birds,
   and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the
   walled rose-gardens.

   In time there were no more swords, three-cornered hats, or periwigs in
   the Street. How strange seemed the inhabitants with their
   walking-sticks, tall beavers, and cropped heads! New sounds came from
   the distance--first strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile
   away, and then, many years later, strange puffings and shrieks and
   rumblings from other directions. The air was not quite so pure as
   before, but the spirit of the place had not changed. The blood and soul
   of their ancestors had fashioned the Street. Nor did the spirit change
   when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes, or when they
   set up tall posts bearing weird wires. There was so much ancient lore
   in that Street, that the past could not easily be forgotten.

   Then came days of evil, when many who had known the Street of old knew
   it no more, and many knew it who had not known it before, and went
   away, for their accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and
   faces unpleasing. Their thoughts, too, fought with the wise, just
   spirit of the Street, so that the Street pined silently as its houses
   fell into decay, and its trees died one by one, and its rose-gardens
   grew rank with weeds and waste. But it felt a stir of pride one day
   when again marched forth young men, some of whom never came back. These
   young men were clad in blue.

   With the years, worse fortune came to the Street. Its trees were all
   gone now, and its rose-gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap,
   ugly new buildings on parallel streets. Yet the houses remained,
   despite the ravages of the years and the storms and worms, for they had
   been made to serve many a generation. New kinds of faces appeared in
   the Street, swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features,
   whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and
   unknown characters upon most of the musty houses. Push-carts crowded
   the gutters. A sordid, undefinable stench settled over the place, and
   the ancient spirit slept.

   Great excitement once came to the Street. War and revolution were
   raging across the seas; a dynasty had collapsed, and its degenerate
   subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the Western Land. Many of
   these took lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the
   songs of birds and the scent of roses. Then the Western Land itself
   awoke and joined the Mother Land in her titanic struggle for
   civilization. Over the cities once more floated the old flag,
   companioned by the new flag, and by a plainer, yet glorious tricolour.
   But not many flags floated over the Street, for therein brooded only
   fear and hatred and ignorance. Again young men went forth, but not
   quite as did the young men of those other days. Something was lacking.
   And the sons of those young men of other days, who did indeed go forth
   in olive-drab with the true spirit of their ancestors, went from
   distant places and knew not the Street and its ancient spirit.

   Over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the
   young men returned. Those who had lacked something lacked it no longer,
   yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the Street; for
   many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distance
   places to the ancient houses. And the young men who had returned dwelt
   there no longer. Swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers, yet
   among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned the
   Street and moulded its spirit. Like and yet unlike, for there was in
   the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition,
   vindictiveness, or misguided zeal. Unrest and treason were abroad
   amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the Western Land its death
   blow, that they might mount to power over its ruins, even as assassins
   had mounted in that unhappy, frozen land from whence most of them had
   come. And the heart of that plotting was in the Street, whose crumbling
   houses teemed with alien makers of discord and echoed with the plans
   and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed day of blood, flame
   and crime.

   Of the various odd assemblages in the Street, the Law said much but
   could prove little. With great diligence did men of hidden badges
   linger and listen about such places as Petrovitch's Bakery, the squalid
   Rifkin School of Modern Economics, the Circle Social Club, and the
   Liberty Cafe. There congregated sinister men in great numbers, yet
   always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue. And still the
   old houses stood, with their forgotten lore of nobler, departed
   centuries; of sturdy Colonial tenants and dewy rose-gardens in the
   moonlight. Sometimes a lone poet or traveler would come to view them,
   and would try to picture them in their vanished glory; yet of such
   travelers and poets there were not many.

   The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of
   a vast band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an
   orgy of slaughter for the extermination of America and of all the fine
   old traditions which the Street had loved. Handbills and papers
   fluttered about filthy gutters; handbills and papers printed in many
   tongues and in many characters, yet all bearing messages of crime and
   rebellion. In these writings the people were urged to tear down the
   laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted, to stamp out the soul of
   the old America--the soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a
   half years of Anglo-Saxon freedom, justice, and moderation. It was said
   that the swart men who dwelt in the Street and congregated in its
   rotting edifices were the brains of a hideous revolution, that at their
   word of command many millions of brainless, besotted beasts would
   stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities,
   burning, slaying, and destroying till the land of our fathers should be
   no more. All this was said and repeated, and many looked forward in
   dread to the fourth day of July, about which the strange writings
   hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt. None could
   tell just whose arrest might cut off the damnable plotting at its
   source. Many times came bands of blue-coated police to search the shaky
   houses, though at last they ceased to come; for they too had grown
   tired of law and order, and had abandoned all the city to its fate.
   Then men in olive-drab came, bearing muskets, till it seemed as if in
   its sad sleep the Street must have some haunting dreams of those other
   days, when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from the
   woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach. Yet could no act
   be performed to check the impending cataclysm, for the swart, sinister
   men were old in cunning.

   So the Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in
   Petrovitch's Bakery, and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the
   Circle Social Club, and Liberty Cafe, and in other places as well, vast
   hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and
   expectation. Over hidden wires strange messages traveled, and much was
   said of still stranger messages yet to travel; but most of this was not
   guessed till afterward, when the Western Land was safe from the peril.
   The men in olive-drab could not tell what was happening, or what they
   ought to do; for the swart, sinister men were skilled in subtlety and
   concealment.

   And yet the men in olive-drab will always remember that night, and will
   speak of the Street as they tell of it to their grandchildren; for many
   of them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which
   they had expected. It was known that this nest of anarchy was old, and
   that the houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the
   storms and worms; yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise
   because of its very queer uniformity. It was, indeed, an exceedingly
   singular happening, though after all, a simple one. For without
   warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of
   the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and
   after the crash there was nothing left standing in the Street save two
   ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall. Nor did anything that
   had been alive come alive from the ruins. A poet and a traveler, who
   came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene, tell odd stories. The
   poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins
   indistinctly in the glare of the arc-lights; that there loomed above
   the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe moonlight and
   fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity. And the traveler
   declares that instead of the place's wonted stench there lingered a
   delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom. But are not the dreams of
   poets and the tales of travelers notoriously false?

   There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be
   those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I have told
   you of the Street.

   Manuscript Found On The Coast Of Yucatan

   On August 20, 1917, I, Karl Heinrich, Graf von Altberg-Ehrenstein,
   Lieutenant-Commander in the Imperial German Navy and in charge of the
   submarine U-29, deposit this bottle and record in the Atlantic Ocean at
   a point to me unknown but probably about N. Latitude 20 degrees, W.
   Longitude 35 degrees, where my ship lies disabled on the ocean floor. I
   do so because of my desire to set certain unusual facts before the
   public; a thing I shall not in all probability survive to accomplish in
   person, since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing as they
   are extraordinary, and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the
   U-29, but the impairment of my iron German will in a manner most
   disastrous.

   On the afternoon of June 18, as reported by wireless to the U-61, bound
   for Kiel, we torpedoed the British freighter Victory, New York to
   Liverpool, in N. Latitude 45 degrees 16 minutes, W. Longitude 28
   degrees 34 minutes; permitting the crew to leave in boats in order to
   obtain a good cinema view for the admiralty records. The ship sank
   quite picturesquely, bow first, the stem rising high out of the water
   whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea. Our
   camera missed nothing, and I regret that so fine a reel of film should
   never reach Berlin. After that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and
   submerged.

   When we rose to the surface about sunset, a seaman's body was found on
   the deck, hands gripping the railing in curious fashion. The poor
   fellow was young, rather dark, and very handsome; probably an Italian
   or Greek, and undoubtedly of the Victory's crew. He had evidently
   sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own
   - one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the English
   pig-dogs are waging upon the Fatherland. Our men searched him for
   souvenirs, and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved
   to represent a youth's head crowned with laurel. My fellow-officer,
   Lieutenant Kienze, believed that the thing was of great age and
   artistic value, so took it from the men for himself. How it had ever
   come into the possession of a common sailor neither he nor I could
   imagine.

   As the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which
   created much disturbance amongst the crew. The fellow's eyes had been
   closed; but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred
   open, and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed
   steadily and mockingly at Schmidt and Zimmer, who were bent over the
   corpse. The Boatswain Muller, an elderly man who would have known
   better had he not been a superstitious Alsatian swine, became so
   excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water; and
   swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming
   position and sped away to the south under the waves. Kienze and I did
   not like these displays of peasant ignorance, and severely reprimanded
   the men, particularly Muller.

   The next day a very troublesome situation was created by the
   indisposition of some of the crew. They were evidently suffering from
   the nervous strain of our long voyage, and had had bad dreams. Several
   seemed quite dazed and stupid; and after satisfying myself that they
   were not feigning their weakness, I excused them from their duties. The
   sea was rather rough, so we descended to a depth where the waves were
   less troublesome. Here we were comparatively calm, despite a somewhat
   puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our
   oceanographic charts. The moans of the sick men were decidedly
   annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralize the rest of the
   crew, we did not resort to extreme measures. It was our plan to remain
   where we were and intercept the liner Dacia, mentioned in information
   from agents in New York.

   In the early evening we rose to the surface, and found the sea less
   heavy. The smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon, but our
   distance and ability to submerge made us safe. What worried us more was
   the talk of Boatswain Muller, which grew wilder as night came on. He
   was in a detestably childish state, and babbled of some illusion of
   dead bodies drifting past the undersea portholes; bodies which looked
   at him intensely, and which he recognized in spite of bloating as
   having seen dying during some of our victorious German exploits. And he
   said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard was their
   leader. This was very gruesome and abnormal, so we confined Muller in
   irons and had him soundly whipped. The men were not pleased at his
   punishment, but discipline was necessary. We also denied the request of
   a delegation headed by Seaman Zimmer, that the curious carved ivory
   head be cast into the sea.

   On June 20, Seaman Bohin and Schmidt, who had been ill the day before,
   became violently insane. I regretted that no physician was included in
   our complement of officers, since German lives are precious; but the
   constant ravings of the two concerning a terrible curse were most
   subversive of discipline, so drastic steps were taken. The crew
   accepted the event in a sullen fashion, but it seemed to quiet Muller;
   who thereafter gave us no trouble. In the evening we released him, and
   he went about his duties silently.

   In the week that followed we were all very nervous, watching for the
   Dacia. The tension was aggravated by the disappearance of Muller and
   Zimmer, who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears
   which had seemed to harass them, though they were not observed in the
   act of jumping overboard. I was rather glad to be rid of Muller, for
   even his silence had unfavorably affected the crew. Everyone seemed
   inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret fear. Many were
   ill, but none made a disturbance. Lieutenant Kienze chafed under the
   strain, and was annoyed by the merest trifle - such as the school of
   dolphins which gathered about the U-29 in increasing numbers, and the
   growing intensity of that southward current which was not on our chart.

   It at length became apparent that we had missed the Dacia altogether.
   Such failures are not uncommon, and we were more pleased than
   disappointed, since our return to Wilhelmshaven was now in order. At
   noon June 28 we turned northeastward, and despite some rather comical
   entanglements with the unusual masses of dolphins, were soon under way.

   The explosion in the engine room at 2 A.M. was wholly a surprise. No
   defect in the machinery or carelessness in the men had been noticed,
   yet without warning the ship was racked from end to end with a colossal
   shock. Lieutenant Kienze hurried to the engine room, finding the
   fuel-tank and most of the mechanism shattered, and Engineers Raabe and
   Schneider instantly killed. Our situation had suddenly become grave
   indeed; for though the chemical air regenerators were intact, and
   though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship and
   opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries
   might hold out, we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine. To
   seek rescue in the life-boats would be to deliver ourselves into the
   hands of enemies unreasonably embittered against our great German
   nation, and our wireless had failed ever since the Victory affair to
   put us in touch with a fellow U-boat of the Imperial Navy.

   From the hour of the accident till July 2 we drifted constantly to the
   south, almost without plans and encountering no vessel. Dolphins still
   encircled the U-29, a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the
   distance we had covered. On the morning of July 2 we sighted a warship
   flying American colors, and the men became very restless in their
   desire to surrender. Finally Lieutenant Menze had to shoot a seaman
   named Traube, who urged this un-German act with especial violence. This
   quieted the crew for the time, and we submerged unseen.

   The next afternoon a dense flock of sea-birds appeared from the south,
   and the ocean began to heave ominously. Closing our hatches, we awaited
   developments until we realized that we must either submerge or be
   swamped in the mounting waves. Our air pressure and electricity were
   diminishing, and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender
   mechanical resources; but in this case there was no choice. We did not
   descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we
   decided to return to the surface. Here, however, a new trouble
   developed; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of
   all that the mechanics could do. As the men grew more frightened at
   this undersea imprisonment, some of them began to mutter again about
   Lieutenant Kienze's ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol
   calmed them. We kept the poor devils as busy as we could, tinkering at
   the machinery even when we knew it was useless.

   Kienze and I usually slept at different times; and it was during my
   sleep, about 5 A.M., July 4, that the general mutiny broke loose. The
   six remaining pigs of seamen, suspecting that we were lost, had
   suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the
   Yankee battleship two days before, and were in a delirium of cursing
   and destruction. They roared like the animals they were, and broke
   instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such
   nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who
   looked at them and swam away. Lieutenant Kienze seemed paralyzed and
   inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish Rhinelander. I
   shot all six men, for it was necessary, and made sure that none
   remained alive.

   We expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the
   U-29. Kienze seemed very nervous, and drank heavily. It was decided
   that we remain alive as long as possible, using the large stock of
   provisions and chemical supply of oxygen, none of which had suffered
   from the crazy antics of those swine-hound seamen. Our compasses, depth
   gauges, and other delicate instruments were ruined; so that henceforth
   our only reckoning would be guess work, based on our watches, the
   calendar, and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we might spy
   through the portholes or from the conning tower. Fortunately we had
   storage batteries still capable of long use, both for interior lighting
   and for the searchlight. We often cast a beam around the ship, but saw
   only dolphins, swimming parallel to our own drifting course. I was
   scientifically interested in those dolphins; for though the ordinary
   Delphinus delphis is a cetacean mammal, unable to subsist without air,
   I watched one of the swimmers closely for two hours, and did not see
   him alter his submerged condition.

   With the passage of time Kienze and I decided that we were still
   drifting south, meanwhile sinking deeper and deeper. We noted the
   marine fauna and flora, and read much on the subject in the books I had
   carried with.me for spare moments. I could not help observing, however,
   the inferior scientific knowledge of my companion. His mind was not
   Prussian, but given to imaginings and speculations which have no value.
   The fact of our coming death affected him curiously, and he would
   frequently pray in remorse over the men, women, and children we had
   sent to the bottom; forgetting that all things are noble which serve
   the German state. After a time he became noticeably unbalanced, gazing
   for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost
   and forgotten things under the sea. Sometimes, as a psychological
   experiment, I would lead him on in the wanderings, and listen to his
   endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships. I was very sorry
   for him, for I dislike to see a German suffer; but he was not a good
   man to die with. For myself I was proud, knowing how the Fatherland
   would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be men like
   me.

   On August 9, we espied the ocean floor, and sent a powerful beam from
   the searchlight over it. It was a vast undulating plain, mostly covered
   with seaweed, and strewn with the shells of small mollusks. Here and
   there were slimy objects of puzzling contour, draped with weeds and
   encrusted with barnacles, which Kienze declared must be ancient ships
   lying in their graves. He was puzzled by one thing, a peak of solid
   matter, protruding above the oceanbed nearly four feet at its apex;
   about two feet thick, with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which
   met at a very obtuse angle. I called the peak a bit of outcropping
   rock, but Kienze thought he saw carvings on it. After a while he began
   to shudder, and turned away from the scene. as if frightened; yet could
   give no explanation save that he was overcome with the vastness,
   darkness, remoteness, antiquity, and mystery of the oceanic abysses.
   His mind was tired, but I am always a German, and was quick to notice
   two things: that the U-29 was standing the deep-sea pressure
   splendidly, and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us, even at
   a depth where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible
   by most naturalists. That I had previously overestimated our depth, I
   was sure; but none the less we must still have been deep enough to make
   these phenomena remarkable. Our southward speed, as gauged by the ocean
   floor, was about as I had estimated from the organisms passed at higher
   levels.

   It was at 3:15 PM., August 12, that poor Kienze went wholly mad. He had
   been in the conning tower using the searchlight when I saw him bound
   into the library compartment where I sat reading, and his face at once
   betrayed him. I will repeat here what he said, underlining the words he
   emphasized: "He is calling! He is calling! I hear him! We must go!" As
   he spoke he took his ivory image from the table, pocketed it, and
   seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck.
   In a moment I understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge
   with me into the water outside, a vagary of suicidal and homicidal
   mania for which I was scarcely prepared. As I hung back and attempted
   to soothe him he grew more violent, saying: "Come now - do not wait
   until later; it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be
   condemned." Then I tried the opposite of the soothing plan, and told
   him he was mad - pitifully demented. But he was unmoved, and cried: "If
   I am mad, it is mercy. May the gods pity the man who in his callousness
   can remam sane to the hideous end! Come and be mad whilst he still
   calls with mercy!"

   This outburst seemed to relieve a pressure in his brain; for as he
   finished he grew much milder, asking me to let him depart alone if I
   would not accompany him. My course at once became clear. He was a
   German, but only a Rhinelander and a commoner; and he was now a
   potentially dangerous madman. By complying with his suicidal request I
   could immediately free myself from one who was no longer a companion
   but a menace. I asked him to give me the ivory image before he went,
   but this request brought from him such uncanny laughter that I did not
   repeat it. Then I asked him if he wished to leave any keepsake or lock
   of hair for his family in Germany in case I should be rescued, but
   again he gave me that strange laugh. So as he climbed the ladder I went
   to the levers and, allowing proper time-intervals, operated the
   machinery which sent him to his death. After I saw that he was no
   longer in the boat I threw the searchlight around the water in an
   effort to obtain a last glimpse of him since I wished to ascertain
   whether the water-pressure would flatten him as it theoretically
   should, or whether the body would be unaffected, like those
   extraordinary dolphins. I did not, however, succeed in finding my late
   companion, for the dolphins were massed thickly and obscuringly about
   the conning tower.

   That evening I regretted that I had not taken the ivory image
   surreptitiously from poor Kienze's pocket as he left, for the memory of
   it fascinated me. I could not forget the youthful, beautiful head with
   its leafy crown, though I am not by nature an artist. I was also sorry
   that I had no one with whom to converse. Kienze, though not my mental
   equal, was much better than no one. I did not sleep well that night,
   and wondered exactly when the end would come. Surely, I had little
   enough chance of rescue.

   The next day I ascended to the conning tower and commenced the
   customary searchlight explorations. Northward the view was much the
   same as it had been all the four days since we had sighted the bottom,
   but I perceived that the drifting of the U-29 was less rapid. As I
   swung the beam around to the south, I noticed that the ocean floor
   ahead fell away in a marked declivity, and bore curiously regular
   blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance with
   definite patterns. The boat did not at once descend to match the
   greater ocean depth, so I was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to
   cast a sharply downward beam. Owing to the abruptness of the change a
   wire was disconnected, which necessitated a delay of many minutes for
   repairs; but at length the light streamed on again, flooding the marine
   valley below me.

   I am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great
   when I saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow. And yet as one
   reared in the best Kultur of Prussia, I should not have been amazed,
   for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in
   oceanic and continental areas. What I saw was an extended and elaborate
   array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified
   architecture, and in various stages of preservation. Most appeared to
   be of marble, gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight, and the
   general plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley, with
   numerous isolated temples and villas on the steep slopes above. Roofs
   were fallen and columns were broken, but there still remained an air of
   immemorially ancient splendor which nothing could efface.

   Confronted at last with the Atlantis I had formerly deemed largely a
   myth, I was the most eager of explorers. At the bottom of that valley a
   river once had flowed; for as I examined the scene more closely I
   beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea-walls, and
   terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful. In my enthusiasm I
   became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor Kienze, and was very
   tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last,
   allowing the U-29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an
   airplane settles upon a town of the upper earth. I was slow, too, in
   realizing that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished.

   In about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky
   wall of the valley. On one side I could view the entire city as it
   sloped from the plaza down to the old river-bank; on the other side, in
   startling proximity, I was confronted by the richly ornate and
   perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple,
   hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this
   titanic thing I can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense
   magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its
   windows are many and widely distributed. In the center yawns a great
   open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by
   exquisite carvings like the figures of Bacchanals in relief. Foremost
   of all are the great columns and frieze, both decorated with sculptures
   of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealized pastoral scenes
   and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial
   devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most
   phenomenal perfection, largely Hellenic in idea, yet strangely
   individual. It imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though
   it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of Greek art.
   Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned
   from the virgin hillside rock of our planet. It is palpably a part of
   the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated I
   cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the
   nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur
   of this awful fane - for fane indeed it must be - and today after
   thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless
   night and silence of an ocean-chasm.

   I cannot reckon the number of hours I spent in gazing at the sunken
   city with its buildings, arches, statues, and bridges, and the colossal
   temple with its beauty and mystery. Though I knew that death was near,
   my curiosity was consuming; and I threw the searchlight beam about in
   eager quest. The shaft of light permitted me to learn many details, but
   refused to show anything within the gaping door of the rock-hewn
   temple; and after a time I turned off the current, conscious of the
   need of conserving power. The rays were now perceptibly dimmer than
   they had been during the weeks of drifting. And as if sharpened by the
   coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets
   grew. I, a German, should be the first to tread those eon-forgotten
   ways!

   I produced and examined a deep-sea diving suit of jointed metal, and
   experimented with the portable light and air regenerator. Though I
   should have trouble in managing the double hatches alone, I believed I
   could overcome all obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk
   about the dead city in person.

   On August 16 I effected an exit from the U-29, and laboriously made my
   way through the ruined and mud-choked streets to the ancient river. I
   found no skeletons or other human remains, but gleaned a wealth of
   archeological lore from sculptures and coins. Of this I cannot now
   speak save to utter my awe at a culture in the full noon of glory when
   cave-dwellers roamed Europe and the Nile flowed unwatched to the sea.
   Others, guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found, must
   unfold the mysteries at which I can only hint. I returned to the boat
   as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock
   temple on the following day.

   On the 17th, as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple
   waxed still more insistent, a great disappointment befell me; for I
   found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had
   perished in the mutiny of those pigs in July. My rage was unbounded,
   yet my German sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly
   black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine
   monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings I could never
   extricate myself. All I could do was to turn on the waning searchlight
   of the U-29, and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the
   exterior carvings. The shaft of light entered the door at an upward
   angle, and I peered in to see if I could glimpse anything, but all in
   vain. Not even the roof was visible; and though I took a step or two
   inside after testing the floor with a staff, I dared not go farther.
   Moreover, for the first time in my life I experienced the emotion of
   dread. I began to realize how some of poor Kienze's moods had arisen,
   for as the temple drew me more and more, I feared its aqueous abysses
   with a blind and mounting terror. Returning to the submarine, I turned
   off the lights and sat thinking in the dark. Electricity must now be
   saved for emergencies.

   Saturday the 18th I spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and
   memories that threatened to overcome my German will. Kienze had gone
   mad and perished before reaching this sinster remnant of a past
   unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him. Was, indeed,
   Fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more
   horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of? Clearly, my
   nerves were sorely taxed, and I must cast off these impressions of
   weaker men.

   I could not sleep Saturday night, and turned on the lights regardless
   of the future. It was annoying that the electricity should not last out
   the air and provisions. I revived my thoughts of euthanasia, and
   examined my automatic pistol. Toward morning I must have dropped asleep
   with the lights on, for I awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find
   the batteries dead. I struck several matches in succession, and
   desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to
   use up the few candles we carried.

   After the fading of the last match I dared to waste, I sat very quietly
   without a light. As I considered the inevitable end my mind ran over
   preceding events, and developed a hitherto dormant impression which
   would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder. The
   head of the radiant god in the sculptures on the rock temple is the
   same as that carven bit of ivory which the dead sailor brought from the
   sea and which poor Kienze carried back into the sea.

   I was a little dazed by this coincidence, but did not become terrified.
   It is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and
   the complex by the primitive shortcut of supernaturalism. The
   coincidence was strange, but I was too sound a reasoner to connect
   circumstances which admit of no logical connection, or to associate in
   any uncanny fashion the disastrous events which had led from the
   Victory affair to my present plight. Feeling the need of more rest, I
   took a sedative and secured some more sleep. My nervous condition was
   reflected in my dreams, for I seemed to hear the cries of drowning
   persons, and to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the
   boat. And among the dead faces was the living, mocking face of the
   youth with the ivory image.

   I must be careful how I record my awakening today, for I am unstrung,
   and much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact. Psychologically
   my case is most interesting, and I regret that it cannot be observed
   scientifically by a competent German authority. Upon opening my eyes my
   first sensation was an overmastering desire to visit the rock temple; a
   desire which grew every instant, yet which I automatically sought to
   resist through some emotion of fear which operated in the reverse
   direction. Next there came to me the impression of light amidst the
   darkness of dead batteries, and I seemed to see a sort of
   phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened
   toward the temple. This aroused my curiosity, for I knew of no deep-sea
   organism capable of emitting such luminosity.

   But before I could investigate there came a third impression which
   because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of
   anything my senses might record. It was an aural delusion; a sensation
   of rhythmic, melodic sound as of some wild yet beautiful chant or
   choral hymn, coming from the outside through the absolutely sound-proof
   hull of the U-29. Convinced of my psychological and nervous
   abnormallty, I lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium
   bromide solution, which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling
   the illusion of sound. But the phosphorescence remained, and I had
   difficulty in repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and
   seek its source. It was horribly realistic, and I could soon
   distinguish by its aid the familiar objects around me, as well as the
   empty sodium bromide glass of which I had had no former visual
   impression in its present location. This last circumstance made me
   ponder, and I crossed the room and touched the glass. It was indeed in
   the place where I had seemed to see it. Now I knew that the light was
   either real or part of an hallucination so fixed and consistent that I
   could not hope to dispel it, so abandoning all resistance I ascended to
   the conning tower to look for the luminous agency. Might it not
   actually be another U-boat, offering possibilities of rescue?

   It is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective
   truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessily
   the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind. When I
   attained the conning tower I found the sea in general far less luminous
   than I had expected. There was no animal or vegetable phosphorescence
   about, and the city that sloped down to the river was invisible in
   blackness. What I did see was not spectacular, not grotesque or
   terrifying, yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my
   consciousness. For the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn
   from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance, as
   from a mighty altar-flame far within.

   Later incidents are chaotic. As I stared at the uncannily lighted door
   and windows, I became subject to the most extravagant visions - visions
   so extravagant that I cannot even relate them. I fancied that I
   discerned objects in the temple; objects both stationary and moving;
   and seemed to hear again the unreal chant that had floated to me when
   first I awaked. And over all rose thoughts and fears which centered in
   the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated
   on the frieze and columns of the temple before me. I thought of poor
   Kienze, and wondered where his body rested with the image he had
   carried back into the sea. He had warned me of something, and I had not
   heeded - but he was a soft-headed Rhinelander who went mad at troubles
   a Prussian could bear with ease.

   The rest is very simple. My impulse to visit and enter the temple has
   now become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately
   cannot be denied. My own German will no longer controls my acts, and
   volition is henceforward possible only in minor matters. Such madness
   it was which drove Kienze to his death, bare-headed and unprotected in
   the ocean; but I am a Prussian and a man of sense, and will use to the
   last what little will I have. When first I saw that I must go, I
   prepared my diving suit, helmet, and air regenerator for instant
   donning, and immediately commenced to write this hurried chronicle in
   the hope that it may some day reach the world. I shall seal the
   manuscript in a bottle and entrust it to the sea as I leave the U-29
   for ever.

   I have no fear, not even from the prophecies of the madman Kienze. What
   I have seen cannot be true, and I know that this madness of my own will
   at most lead only to suffocation when my air is gone. The light in the
   temple is a sheer delusion, and I shall die calmly like a German, in
   the black and forgotten depths. This demoniac laughter which I hear as
   I write comes only from my own weakening brain. So I will carefully don
   my suit and walk boldly up the steps into the primal shrine, that
   silent secret of unfathomed waters and uncounted years.

   8528The Terrible Old ManH. P. Lovecraft

   It was the design of Angelo Ricci and Joe Czanek and Manuel Silva to
   call on the Terrible Old Man. This old man dwells all alone in a very
   ancient house on Water Street near the sea, and is reputed to be both
   exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble; which forms a situation very
   attractive to men of the profession of Messrs. Ricci, Czanek, and
   Silva, for that profession was nothing less dignified than robbery.

   The inhabitants of Kingsport say and think many things about the
   Terrible Old Man which generally keep him safe from the attention of
   gentlemen like Mr. Ricci and his colleagues, despite the almost certain
   fact that he hides a fortune of indefinite magnitude somewhere about
   his musty and venerable abode. He is, in truth, a very strange person,
   believed to have been a captain of East India clipper ships in his day;
   so old that no one can remember when he was young, and so taciturn that
   few know his real name. Among the gnarled trees in the front yard of
   his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large
   stones, oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in
   some obscure Eastern temple. This collection frightens away most of the
   small boys who love to taunt the Terrible Old Man about his long white
   hair and beard, or to break the small-paned windows of his dwelling
   with wicked missiles; but there are other things which frighten the
   older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer
   in through the dusty panes. These folk say that on a table in a bare
   room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles, in each a small
   piece of lead suspended pendulum-wise from a string. And they say that
   the Terrible Old Man talks to these bottles, addressing them by such
   names as Jack, Scar-Face, Long Tom, Spanish Joe, Peters, and Mate
   Ellis, and that whenever he speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum
   within makes certain definite vibrations as if in answer.

   Those who have watched the tall, lean, Terrible Old Man in these
   peculiar conversations, do not watch him again. But Angelo Ricci and
   Joe Czanek and Manuel Silva were not of Kingsport blood; they were of
   that new and heterogeneous alien stock which lies outside the charmed
   circle of New England life and traditions, and they saw in the Terrible
   Old Man merely a tottering, almost helpless grey-beard, who could not
   walk without the aid of his knotted cane, and whose thin, weak hands
   shook pitifully. They were really quite sorry in their way for the
   lonely, unpopular old fellow, whom everybody shunned, and at whom all
   the dogs barked singularly. But business is business, and to a robber
   whose soul is in his profession, there is a lure and a challenge about
   a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank, and who
   pays for his few necessities at the village store with Spanish gold and
   silver minted two centuries ago.

   Messrs. Ricci, Czanek, and Silva selected the night of April 11th for
   their call. Mr. Ricci and Mr. Silva were to interview the poor old
   gentleman, whilst Mr. Czanek waited for them and their presumable
   metallic burden with a covered motor-car in Ship Street, by the gate in
   the tall rear wall of their host's grounds. Desire to avoid needless
   explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these
   plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure.

   As prearranged, the three adventurers started out separately in order
   to prevent any evil-minded suspicions afterward. Messrs. Ricci and
   Silva met in Water Street by the old man's front gate, and although
   they did not like the way the moon shone down upon the painted stones
   through the budding branches of the gnarled trees, they had more
   important things to think about than mere idle superstition. They
   feared it might be unpleasant work making the Terrible Old Man
   loquacious concerning his hoarded gold and silver, for aged
   sea-captains are notably stubborn and perverse. Still, he was very old
   and very feeble, and there were two visitors. Messrs. Ricci and Silva
   were experienced in the art of making unwilling persons voluble, and
   the screams of a weak and exceptionally venerable man can be easily
   muffled. So they moved up to the one lighted window and heard the
   Terrible Old Man talking childishly to his bottles with pendulums. Then
   they donned masks and knocked politely at the weather-stained oaken
   door.

   Waiting seemed very long to Mr. Czanek as he fidgeted restlessly in the
   covered motor-car by the Terrible Old Man's back gate in Ship Street.
   He was more than ordinarily tender-hearted, and he did not like the
   hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour
   appointed for the deed. Had he not told his colleagues to be as gentle
   as possible with the pathetic old sea-captain? Very nervously he
   watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivy-clad stone wall.
   Frequently he consulted his watch, and wondered at the delay. Had the
   old man died before revealing where his treasure was hidden, and had a
   thorough search become necessary? Mr. Czanek did not like to wait so
   long in the dark in such a place. Then he sensed a soft tread or
   tapping on the walk inside the gate, heard a gentle fumbling at the
   rusty latch, and saw the narrow, heavy door swing inward. And in the
   pallid glow of the single dim street-lamp he strained his eyes to see
   what his colleagues had brought out of that sinister house which loomed
   so close behind. But when he looked, he did not see what he had
   expected; for his colleagues were not there at all, but only the
   Terrible Old Man leaning quietly on his knotted cane and smiling
   hideously. Mr. Czanek had never before noticed the colour of that man's
   eyes; now he saw that they were yellow.

   Little things make considerable excitement in little towns, which is
   the reason that Kingsport people talked all that spring and summer
   about the three unidentifiable bodies, horribly slashed as with many
   cutlasses, and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel
   boot-heels, which the tide washed in. And some people even spoke of
   things as trivial as the deserted motor-car found in Ship Street, or
   certain especially inhuman cries, probably of a stray animal or
   migratory bird, heard in the night by wakeful citizens. But in this
   idle village gossip the Terrible Old Man took no interest at all. He
   was by nature reserved, and when one is aged and feeble, one's reserve
   is doubly strong. Besides, so ancient a sea-captain must have witnessed
   scores of things much more stirring in the far-off days of his
   unremembered youth.

   The Thing in the Moonlight  (1941)
   by Jack Chapman Miske
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Wikipedia article.

   The Thing in the Moonlight is a short story by J. Chapman Miske, based
   on a letter from H. P. Lovecraft to Donald Wandrei, dated November 24,
   1927. This letter describes a dream that Lovecraft had. The story was
   prepared for publication by Miske, who filled in the story surrounding
   the description of the dream. In places, the letter and published story
   are identical, word-for-word. It was first published in Bizarre
   magazine in January 1941.-- Excerpted from The Thing in the Moonlight
   on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
   88176The Thing in the MoonlightJack Chapman Miske1941

   Morgan is not a literary man; in fact he cannot speak English with any
   degree of coherency. That is what makes me wonder about the words he
   wrote, though others have laughed.

   He was alone the evening it happened. Suddenly an unconquerable urge to
   write came over him, and taking pen in hand he wrote the following:

   My name is Howard Phillips. I live at 66 College Street, in Providence,
   Rhode Island. On November 24, 1927--for I know not even what the year
   may be now--, I fell asleep and dreamed, since when I have been unable
   to awaken.

   My dream began in a dank, reed-choked marsh that lay under a gray
   autumn sky, with a rugged cliff of lichen-crusted stone rising to the
   north. Impelled by some obscure quest, I ascended a rift or cleft in
   this beetling precipice, noting as I did so the black mouths of many
   fearsome burrows extending from both walls into the depths of the stony
   plateau.

   At several points the passage was roofed over by the choking of the
   upper parts of the narrow fissure; these places being exceeding dark,
   and forbidding the perception of such burrows as may have existed
   there. In one such dark space I felt conscious of a singular accession
   of fright, as if some subtle and bodiless emanation from the abyss were
   engulfing my spirit; but the blackness was too great for me to perceive
   the source of my alarm.

   At length I emerged upon a tableland of moss-grown rock and scanty
   soil, lit by a faint moonlight which had replaced the expiring orb of
   day. Casting my eyes about, I beheld no living object; but was sensible
   of a very peculiar stirring far below me, amongst the whispering rushes
   of the pestilential swamp I had lately quitted.

   After walking for some distance, I encountered the rusty tracks of a
   street railway, and the worm-eaten poles which still held the limp and
   sagging trolley wire. Following this line, I soon came upon a yellow,
   vestibuled car numbered 1852--of a plain, double-trucked type common
   from 1900 to 1910. It was untenanted, but evidently ready to start; the
   trolley being on the wire and the air-brake now and then throbbing
   beneath the floor. I boarded it and looked vainly about for the light
   switch--noting as I did so the absence of the controller handle, which
   thus implied the brief absence of the motorman. Then I sat down in one
   of the cross seats of the vehicle. Presently I heard a swishing in the
   sparse grass toward the left, and saw the dark forms of two men looming
   up in the moonlight. They had the regulation caps of a railway company,
   and I could not doubt but that they were conductor and motorman. Then
   one of them sniffed with singular sharpness, and raised his face to
   howl to the moon. The other dropped on all fours to run toward the car.

   I leaped up at once and raced madly out of that car and across endless
   leagues of plateau till exhaustion forced me to stop--doing this not
   because the conductor had dropped on all fours, but because the face of
   the motorman was a mere white cone tapering to one
   blood-red-tentacle...

   I was aware that I only dreamed, but the very awareness was not
   pleasant. Since that fearful night, I have prayed only for
   awakening--it has not come!

   Instead I have found myself an inhabitant of this terrible dream-world!
   That first night gave way to dawn, and I wandered aimlessly over the
   lonely swamp-lands. When night came, I still wandered, hoping for
   awakening. But suddenly I parted the weeds and saw before me the
   ancient railway car--and to one side a cone-faced thing lifted its head
   and in the streaming moonlight howled strangely!

   It has been the same each day. Night takes me always to that place of
   horror. I have tried not moving, with the coming of nightfall, but I
   must walk in my slumber, for always I awaken with the thing of dread
   howling before me in the pale moonlight, and I turn and flee madly.

   God! when will I awaken?

   That is what Morgan wrote. I would go to 66 College Street in
   Providence, but I fear for what I might find there.

I[edit]

   It is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best
   friend, and yet I hope to show by this statement that I am not his
   murderer. At first I shall be called a madman - madder than the man I
   shot in his cell at the Arkham Sanitarium. Later some of my readers
   will weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask
   themselves how I could have believed otherwise than I did after facing
   the evidence of that horror - that thing on the doorstep.

   Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have
   acted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misled - or whether I am
   not mad after all. I do not know - but others have strange things to
   tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are at
   their wits' ends to account for that last terrible visit. They have
   tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by
   discharged servants, yet they know in their hearts that the truth is
   something infinitely more terrible and incredible.

   So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged
   him, and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might
   have loosed untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of
   shadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks
   a passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike
   before reckoning the consequences.

   I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior,
   he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was
   eight and I was sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I
   have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic,
   almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps
   his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with
   his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which
   startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained
   to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom
   had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this
   doubtless fostered a strange secretive life in the boy, with
   imagination as his one avenue of freedom.

   At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his
   facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About
   that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and I
   found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our
   joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient,
   mouldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we live - witch-cursed,
   legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and
   crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the
   darkly muttering Miskatonic.

   As time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of
   illustrating a book of Edward's demoniac poems, yet our comradeship
   suffered no lessening. Young Derby's odd genius developed remarkably,
   and in his eighteenth year his collected nightmare-lyrics made a real
   sensation when issued under the title Azathoth and Other Horrors. He
   was a close correspondent of the notorious Baudelairean poet Justin
   Geoffrey, who wrote The People of the Monolith and died screaming in a
   madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister, ill-regarded village in
   Hungary.

   In self-reliance and practical affairs, however, Derby was greatly
   retarded because of his coddled existence. His health had improved, but
   his habits of childish dependence were fostered by over-careful
   parents, so that he never travelled alone, made independent decisions,
   or assumed responsibilities. It was early seen that he would not be
   equal to a struggle in the business or professional arena, but the
   family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy. As he grew to
   years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness. Blond
   and blue-eyed, he had the fresh complexion of a child; and his attempt
   to raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty. His voice
   was soft and light, and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile
   chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age. He was
   of good height, and his handsome face would have made him a notable
   gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness.

   Derby's parents took him abroad every summer, and he was quick to seize
   on the surface aspects of European thought and expression. His Poe-like
   talents turned more and more toward the decadent, and other artistic
   sensitiveness and yearnings were half-aroused in him. We had great
   discussions in those days. I had been through Harvard, had studied in a
   Boston architect's office, had married, and had finally returned to
   Arkham to practise my profession - settling in the family homestead in
   Saltonstall Street since my father had moved to Florida for his health.
   Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came to regard him as
   one of the household. He had a characteristic way of ringing the
   doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code
   signal, so that after dinner I always listened for the familiar three
   brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause. Less frequently I
   would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his
   constantly growing library.

   Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkahm since his parents
   would not let him board away from them. He entered at sixteen and
   completed his course in three years, majoring in English and French
   literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and
   the sciences. He mingled very little with the other students, though
   looking enviously at the "daring" or "Bohemian" set - whose
   superficially "smart" language and meaningless ironic pose he aped, and
   whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt.

   What he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of
   subterranean magical lore, for which Miskatonic's library was and is
   famous. Always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness, he
   now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous
   past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity. He read things like
   the frightful Book of Eibon, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt,
   and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, though
   he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was twenty when my
   son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I named the
   newcomer Edward Derby Upton after him.

   By the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned
   man and a fairly well known poet and fantaisiste though his lack of
   contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by
   making his products derivative and over-bookish. I was perhaps his
   closest friend - finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical
   topics, while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not
   wish to refer to his parents. He remained single - more through
   shyness, inertia, and parental protectiveness than through inclination
   - and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory
   extent. When the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him
   at home. I went to Plattsburg for a commission but never got overseas.

   So the years wore on. Edward's mother died when he was thirty four and
   for months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady. His
   father took him to Europe, however, and he managed to pull out of his
   trouble without visible effects. Afterward he seemed to feel a sort of
   grotesque exhilaration, as if of partial escape from some unseen
   bondage. He began to mingle in the more "advanced" college set despite
   his middle age, and was present at some extremely wild doings - on one
   occasion paying heavy blackmail (which he borrowed of me) to keep his
   presence at a certain affair from his father's notice. Some of the
   whispered rumors about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely singular.
   There was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond
   credibility.

II[edit]

   Edward was thirty-eight when he met Asenath Waite. She was, I judge,
   about twenty-three at the time; and was taking a special course in
   mediaeval metaphysics at Miskatonic. The daughter of a friend of mine
   had met her before - in the Hall School at Kingsport - and had been
   inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation. She was dark,
   smallish, and very good-looking except for overprotuberant eyes; but
   something in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people. It
   was, however, largely her origin and conversation which caused average
   folk to avoid her. She was one of the Innsmouth Waites, and dark
   legends have clustered for generations about crumbling, half-deserted
   Innsmouth and its people. There are tales of horrible bargains about
   the year 1850, and of a strange element "not quite human" in the
   ancient families of the run-down fishing port - tales such as only
   old-time Yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness.

   Asenath's case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite's
   daughter - the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went
   veiled. Ephraim lived in a half-decayed mansion in Washington Street,
   Innsmouth, and those who had seen the place (Arkham folk avoid going to
   Innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were
   always boarded, and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within
   as evening drew on. The old man was known to have been a prodigious
   magical student in his day, and legend averred that he could raise or
   quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him once or twice
   in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the
   college library, and had hated his wolfish, saturnine face with its
   tangle of iron-grey beard. He had died insane - under rather queer
   circumstances - just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal
   ward of the principal) entered the Hall School, but she had been his
   morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times.

   The friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite
   repeated many curious things when the news of Edward's acquaintance
   with her began to spread about. Asenath, it seemed, had posed as a kind
   of magician at school; and had really seemed able to accomplish some
   highly baffling marvels. She professed to be able to raise
   thunderstorms, though her seeming success was generally laid to some
   uncanny knack at prediction. All animals markedly disliked her, and she
   could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand. There
   were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very
   singular - and very shocking - for a young girl; when she would
   frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind,
   and would seem to extract an obscene zestful irony from her present
   situation.

   Most unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence
   over other persons. She was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By
   gazing peculiarly at a fellow-student she would often give the latter a
   distinct feeling of exchanged personality - as if the subject were
   placed momentarily in the magician's body and able to stare half across
   the room at her real body, whose eyes blazed and protruded with an
   alien expression. Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of
   consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame - or at
   least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning rage,
   however, was that she was not a man; since she believed a male brain
   had certain unique and far-reaching cosmic powers. Given a man's brain,
   she declared, she could not only equal but surpass her father in
   mastery of unknown forces.

   Edward met Asenath at a gathering of "intelligentsia" held in one of
   the students' rooms, and could talk of nothing else when he came to see
   me the next day. He had found her full of the interests and erudition
   which engrossed him most, and was in addition wildly taken with her
   appearance. I had never seen the young woman, and recalled casual
   references only faintly, but I knew who she was. It seemed rather
   regrettable that Derby should become so upheaved about her; but I said
   nothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on opposition. He
   was not, he said, mentioning her to his father.

   In the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young
   Derby. Others now remarked Edward's autumnal gallantry, though they
   agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age, or seem at all
   inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity. He was only a
   trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self-indulgence, and his face
   was absolutely without lines. Asenath, on the other hand, had the
   premature crow's feet which come from the exercises of an intense will.

   About this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at once
   saw that his interest was by no means one-sided. She eyed him
   continually with an almost predatory air, and I perceived that their
   intimacy was beyond untangling. Soon afterward I had a visit from old
   Mr. Derby, whom I had always admired and respected. He had heard the
   tales of his son's new friendship, and had wormed the whole truth out
   of "the boy." Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even been looking
   at houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with his
   son, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised
   affair off; but I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not
   a question of Edward's weak will but of the woman's strong will. The
   perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image
   to a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it.

   The wedding was performed a month later - by a justice of the peace,
   according to the bride's request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered no
   opposition, and he, my wife, my son, and I attended the brief ceremony
   - the other guests being wild young people from the college. Asenath
   had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the end of
   High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to
   Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household goods
   were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for
   Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its
   library, and its crowd of "sophisticates," that made Asenath settle in
   Arkham instead of returning permanently home.

   When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked
   slightly changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped
   moustache, but there was more than that. He looked soberer and more
   thoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being
   exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide
   whether I liked or disliked the change. Certainly he seemed for the
   moment more normally adult than ever before. Perhaps the marriage was a
   good thing - might not the change of dependence form a start toward
   actual neutralisaton, leading ultimately to responsible independence?
   He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought a vast store
   of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered as he spoke the
   name), and was finishing the restoration of the Crowninshield house and
   grounds.

   Her home - in that town - was a rather disgusting place, but certain
   objects in it had taught him some surprising things. He was progressing
   fast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath's guidance. Some of the
   experiments she proposed were very daring and radical - he did not feel
   at liberty to describe them - but he had confidence in her powers and
   intentions. The three servants were very queer - an incredibly aged
   couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred occasionally to him
   and to Asenath's dead mother in a cryptic way, and a swarthy young
   wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a
   perpetual odour of fish.

III[edit]

   For the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would
   sometimes slip by without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the
   front door; and when he did call - or when, as happened with increasing
   infrequency, I called on him - he was very little disposed to converse
   on vital topics. He had become secretive about those occult studies
   which he used to describe and discuss so minutely, and preferred not to
   talk of his wife. She had aged tremendously since her marriage, till
   now - oddly enough - she seemed the elder of the two. Her face held the
   most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her
   whole aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife
   and son noticed it as much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call on
   her - for which, Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless
   moments, she was unmitigatedly grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would
   go on long trips - ostensibly to Europe, though Edward sometimes hinted
   at obscurer destinations.

   It was after the first year that people began talking about the change
   in Edward Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely
   psychological; but it brought up some interesting points. Now and then,
   it seemed Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things
   wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For example -
   although in the old days he could not drive a car, he was now seen
   occasionally to dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with
   Asenath's powerful Packard, handling it like a master, and meeting
   traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to
   his accustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back
   from some trip or just starting on one - what sort of trip, no one
   could guess, although he mostly favoured the Innsmouth road.

   Oddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing. People said
   he looked too much like his wife, or like old Ephraim Waite himself, in
   these moments - or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they
   were so rare. Sometimes, hours after starting out in this way, he would
   return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an
   obviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove. Also, his preponderant
   aspect on the streets during his decreasing round of social contacts
   (including, I may say, his calls on me) was the old-time indecisive one
   - its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past.
   While Asenath's face aged, Edward - aside from those exceptional
   occasions - actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity,
   save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash
   across it. It was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost
   dropped out of the gay college circle - not through their own disgust,
   we heard, but because something about their present studies shocked
   even the most callous of the other decadents.

   It was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint
   openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall
   remarks about things "going too far," and would talk darkly about the
   need of "gaining his identity." At first I ignored such references, but
   in time I began to question him guardedly, remembering what my friend's
   daughter had said about Asenath's hypnotic influence over the other
   girls at school - the cases where students had thought they were in her
   body looking across the room at themselves. This questioning seemed to
   make him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled something
   about having a serious talk with me later. About this time old Mr.
   Derby died, for which I was afterward very thankful. Edward was badly
   upset, though by no means disorganized. He had seen astonishingly
   little of his parent since his marriage, for Asenath had concentrated
   in herself all his vital sense of family linkage. Some called him
   callous in his loss - especially since those jaunty and confident moods
   in the car began to increase. He now wished to move back into the old
   family mansion, but Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield
   house to which she had become well adjusted.

   Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend - one of
   the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of
   High Street to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot briskly out
   of the drive with Edward's oddly confident and almost sneering face
   above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by the repulsive
   wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look at the house
   in leaving. There, at one of Edward's library windows, she had glimpsed
   a hastily withdrawn face - a face whose expression of pain, defeat, and
   wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It was -
   incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast - Asenath's;
   yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of
   poor Edward were gazing out from it.

   Edward's calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints
   occasionally became concrete. What he said was not to be believed, even
   in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his dark lore
   with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity.
   He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places, of cyclopean ruins
   in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast staircases led down
   to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex angles that led through
   invisible walls to other regions of space and time, and of hideous
   exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and
   forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different space-time
   continua.

   He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects
   which utterly nonplussed me - elusively coloured and bafflingly
   textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane
   curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose, and followed no
   conceivable geometry. These things, he said, came "from outside"; and
   his wife knew how to get them. Sometimes - but always in frightened and
   ambiguous whisper - he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite,
   whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days.
   These adumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around
   some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really
   dead - in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense.

   At times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations, and I wondered
   whether Asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance
   and cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism -
   some power of the kind she had displayed at school. Certainly, she
   suspected that he told me things, for as the weeks passed she tried to
   stop his visits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency.
   Only with difficulty could he get to see me, for although he would
   pretend to be going somewhere else, some invisible force would
   generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the
   time being. His visits usually came when Asenath was way - "away in her
   own body," as he once oddly put it. She always found out later - the
   servants watched his goings and coming - but evidently she thought it
   inexpedient to do anything drastic.

IV[edit]

   Derby had been married more than three years on that August day when I
   got that telegram from Maine. I had not seen him for two months, but
   had heard he was away "on business." Asenath was supposed to be with
   him, though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in the
   house behind the doubly curtained windows. They had watched the
   purchases made by the servants. And now the town marshal of Chesuncook
   had wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with
   delirious ravings and screamed to me for protection. It was Edward -
   and he had been just able to recall his own name and address.

   Chesuncook is close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest
   belt in Maine, and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through
   fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car. I found Derby
   in a cell at the town farm, vacillating between frenzy and apathy. He
   knew me at once, and began pouring out a meaningless, half-incoherent
   torrent of words in my direction.

   "Dan, for God's sake! The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand
   steps... the abomination of abominations... I never would let her take
   me, and then I found myself there - Ia! Shub-Niggurath! - The shape
   rose up from the altar, and there were five hundred that howled - The
   Hooded Thing bleated 'Kamog! Kamog!' - that was old Ephraim's secret
   name in the coven - I was there, where she promised she wouldn't take
   me - A minute before I was locked in the library, and then I was there
   where she had gone with my body - in the place of utter blasphemy, the
   unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate
   - I saw a shoggoth - it changed shape - I can't stand it - I'll kill
   her if she ever sends me there again - I'll kill that entity - her,
   him, it - I'll kill it! I'll kill it with my own hands!"

   It took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next day
   I got him decent clothes in the village, and set out with him for
   Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to be
   silent, though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed
   through Augusta - as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant
   memories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering
   the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife - delusions
   undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had
   been subjected - I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I
   resolved, put him up myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness
   it would make with Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for
   most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage
   suicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby's muttering
   faded away, and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I
   drove.

   During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again,
   more distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of
   utterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had preyed
   on Edward's nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set of
   hallucinations around her. His present predicament, he mumbled
   furtively, was only one of a long series. She was getting hold of him,
   and he knew that some day she would never let go. Even now she probably
   let him go only when she had to, because she couldn't hold on long at a
   time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for
   nameless rites, leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs - but
   sometimes she couldn't hold on, and he would find himself suddenly in
   his own body again in some far-off, horrible, and perhaps unknown
   place. Sometimes she'd get hold of him again and sometimes she
   couldn't. Often he was left stranded somewhere as I had found him -
   time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances,
   getting somebody to drive the car after he found it.

   The worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at
   a time. She wanted to be a man - to be fully human - that was why she
   got hold of him. She had sensed the mixture of fine-wrought brain and
   weak will in him. Some day she would crowd him out and disappear with
   his body - disappear to become a great magician like her father and
   leave him marooned in that female shell that wasn't even quite human.
   Yes, he knew about the Innsmouth blood now. There had been traffick
   with things from the sea - it was horrible... And old Ephraim - he had
   known the secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep
   alive - he wanted to live forever - Asenath would succeed - one
   successful demonstration had taken place already.

   As Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying the
   impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me.
   Paradoxically, he seemed in better shape than usual - harder, more
   normally developed, and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused
   by his indolent habits. It was as if he had been really active and
   properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life, and I judged
   that Asenath's force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of
   motion and alertness. But just now his mind was in a pitiable state;
   for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife, about black
   magic, about old Ephraim, and about some revelation which would
   convince even me. He repeated names which I recognized from bygone
   browsings in forbidden volumes, and at times made me shudder with a
   certain thread of mythological consistency - or convincing coherence -
   which ran through his maundering. Again and again he would pause, as if
   to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure.

   "Dan, Dan, don't you remember him - wild eyes and the unkempt beard
   that never turned white? He glared at me once, and I never forgot it.
   Now she glares that way. And I know why! He found it in the
   Necronomicon - the formula. I don't dare tell you the page yet, but
   when I do you can read and understand. Then you will know what has
   engulfed me. On, on, on, on - body to body to body - he means never to
   die. The life-glow - he knows how to break the link... it can flicker
   on a while even when the body is dead. I'll give you hints and maybe
   you'll guess. Listen, Dan - do you know why my wife always takes such
   pains with that silly backhand writing? Have you ever seen a manuscript
   of old Ephraim's? Do you want to know why I shivered when I saw some
   hasty notes Asenath had jotted down?

   "Asenath - is there such a person? Why did they half-think there was
   poison in old Ephraim's stomach? Why do the Gilmans whisper about the
   way he shrieked - like a frightened child - when he went mad and
   Asenath locked him up in the padded attic room where - the other - had
   been? Was it old Ephraim's soul that was locked in? Who locked in whom?
   Why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a
   weak will? - Why did he curse that his daughter wasn't a son? Tell me,
   Daniel Upton - what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of
   horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting, weak-willed
   half-human child at his mercy? Didn't he make it permanent - as she'll
   do in the end with me? Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath
   writes differently off guard, so that you can't tell its script from -
   "

   Then the thing happened. Derby's voice was rising to a thin treble
   scream as he raved, when suddenly it was shut off with an almost
   mechanical click. I thought of those other occasions at my home when
   his confidences had abruptly ceased - when I had half-fancied that some
   obscure telepathic wave of Asenath's mental force was intervening to
   keep him silent. This, though, was something altogether different -
   and, I felt, infinitely more horrible. The face beside me was twisted
   almost unrecognizably for a moment, while through the whole body there
   passed a shivering motion - as if all the bones, organs, muscles,
   nerves, and glands were adjusting themselves to a radically different
   posture, set of stresses, and general personality.

   Just where the supreme horror lay, I could not for my life tell; yet
   there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsion -
   such a freezing, petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormality -
   that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain. The figure beside
   me seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous
   intrusion from outer space - some damnable, utterly accursed focus of
   unknown and malign cosmic forces.

   I had faltered only a moment, but before another moment was over my
   companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him.
   The dusk was now very thick, and the lights of Portland far behind, so
   I could not see much of his face. The blaze of his eyes, though, was
   phenomenal; and I knew that he must now be in that queerly energized
   state - so unlike his usual self - which so many people had noticed. It
   seemed odd and incredible that listless Edward Derby - he who could
   never assert himself, and who had never learned to drive - should be
   ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car, yet that was
   precisely what had happened. He did not speak for some time, and in my
   inexplicable horror I was glad he did not.

   In the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth, and
   shivered at the blaze of his eyes. The people were right - he did look
   damnably like his wife and like old Ephraim when in these moods. I did
   not wonder that the moods were disliked - there was certainly something
   unnatural in them, and I felt the sinister element all the more because
   of the wild ravings I had been hearing. This man, for all my lifelong
   knowledge of Edward Pickman Derby, was a stranger - an intrusion of
   some sort from the black abyss.

   He did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road, and when he
   did his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar. It was deeper, firmer, and
   more decisive than I had ever known it to be; while its accent and
   pronunciation were altogether changed - though vaguely, remotely, and
   rather disturbingly recalling something I could not quite place. There
   was, I thought, a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the
   timbre - not the flashy, meaninglessly jaunty pseudo-irony of the
   callow "sophisticate," which Derby had habitually affected, but
   something grim, basic, pervasive, and potentially evil. I marvelled at
   the self-possession so soon following the spell of panic-struck
   muttering.

   "I hope you'll forget my attack back there, Upton," he was saying. "You
   know what my nerves are, and I guess you can excuse such things. I'm
   enormously grateful, of course, for this lift home.

   "And you must forget, too, any crazy things I may have been saying
   about my wife - and about things in general. That's what comes from
   overstudy in a field like mine. My philosophy is full of bizarre
   concepts, and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of
   imaginary concrete applications. I shall take a rest from now on - you
   probably won't see me for some time, and you needn't blame Asenath for
   it.

   "This trip was a bit queer, but it's really very simple. There are
   certain Indian relics in the north wood - standing stones, and all that
   - which mean a good deal in folklore, and Asenath and I are following
   that stuff up. It was a hard search, so I seem to have gone off my
   head. I must send somebody for the car when I get home. A month's
   relaxation will put me on my feet."

   I do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was, for the
   baffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness. With
   every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased, till at
   length I was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive.
   Derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel, and I was glad of the
   speed with which Portsmouth and Newburyport flashed by.

   At the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids
   Innsmouth, I was half-afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road
   that goes through that damnable place. He did not, however, but darted
   rapidly past Rowley and Ipswich toward our destination. We reached
   Arkham before midnight, and found the lights still on at the old
   Crowninshield house. Derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his
   thanks, and I drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief. It had
   been a terrible drive - all the more terrible because I could not quite
   tell why - and I did not regret Derby's forecast of a long absence from
   my company.

   The next two months were full of rumours. People spoke of seeing Derby
   more and more in his new energized state, and Asenath was scarcely ever
   in to her callers. I had only one visit from Edward, when he called
   briefly in Asenath's car - duly reclaimed from wherever he had left it
   in Maine - to get some books he had lent me. He was in his new state,
   and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks. It was
   plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this condition -
   and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old
   three-and-two signal when ringing the doorbell. As on that evening in
   the car, I felt a faint, infinitely deep horror which I could not
   explain; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief.

   In mid-September Derby was away for a week, and some of the decadent
   college set talked knowingly of the matter - hinting at a meeting with
   a notorious cult-leader, lately expelled from England, who had
   established headquarters in New York. For my part I could not get that
   strange ride from Maine out of my head. The transformation I had
   witnessed had affected me profoundly, and I caught myself again and
   again trying to account for the thing - and for the extreme horror it
   had inspired in me.

   But the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old
   Crowninshield house. The voice seemed to be a woman's, and some of the
   younger people thought it sounded like Asenath's. It was heard only at
   rare intervals, and would sometimes be choked off as if by force. There
   was talk of an investigation, but this was dispelled one day when
   Asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a
   large number of acquaintances - apologizing for her recent absence and
   speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a
   guest from Boston. The guest was never seen, but Asenath's appearance
   left nothing to be said. And then someone complicated matters by
   whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man's voice.

   One evening in mid-October, I heard the familiar three-and-two ring at
   the front door. Answering it myself, I found Edward on the steps, and
   saw in a moment that his personality was the old one which I had not
   encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from
   Chesuncook. His face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in
   which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion, and he looked
   furtively over his shoulder as I closed the door behind him.

   Following me clumsily to the study, he asked for some whiskey to steady
   his nerves. I forbore to question him, but waited till he felt like
   beginning whatever he wanted to say. At length he ventured some
   information in a choking voice.

   "Asenath has gone, Dan. We had a long talk last night while the
   servants were out, and I made her promise to stop preying on me. Of
   course I had certain - certain occult defences I never told you about.
   She had to give in, but got frightfully angry. Just packed up and
   started for New York - walked right out to catch the eight-twenty in to
   Boston. I suppose people will talk, but I can't help that. You needn't
   mention that there was any trouble - just say she's gone on a long
   research trip.

   "She's probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of
   devotees. I hope she'll go west and get a divorce - anyhow, I've made
   her promise to keep away and let me alone. It was horrible, Dan - she
   was stealing my body - crowding me out - making a prisoner of me. I lay
   low and pretended to let her do it, but I had to be on the watch. I
   could plan if I was careful, for she can't read my mind literally, or
   in detail. All she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood
   of rebellion - and she always thought I was helpless. Never thought I
   could get the best of her... but I had a spell or two that worked."

   Derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey.

   "I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back. They
   were ugly about it, and asked questions, but they went. They're her kin
   - Innsmouth people - and were hand and glove with her. I hope they'll
   let me alone - I didn't like the way they laughed when they walked
   away. I must get as many of Dad's old servants again as I can. I'll
   move back home now.

   "I suppose you think I'm crazy, Dan - but Arkham history ought to hint
   at things that back up what I've told you - and what I'm going to tell
   you. You've seen one of the changes, too - in your car after I told you
   about Asenath that day coming home from Maine. That was when she got me
   - drove me out of my body. The last thing I remember was when I was all
   worked up trying to tell you what that she-devil is. Then she got me,
   and in a flash I was back at the house - in the library where those
   damned servants had me locked up - and in that cursed fiend's body that
   isn't even human... You know it was she you must have ridden home with
   - that preying wolf in my body - You ought to have known the
   difference!"

   I shuddered as Derby paused. Surely, I had known the difference - yet
   could I accept an explanation as insane as this? But my distracted
   caller was growing even wilder.

   "I had to save myself - I had to, Dan! She'd have got me for good at
   Hallowmass - they hold a Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook, and the
   sacrifice would have clinched things. She'd have got me for good -
   she'd have been I, and I'd have been she - forever - too late - My
   body'd have been hers for good - She'd have been a man, and fully
   human, just as she wanted to be - I suppose she'd have put me out of
   the way - killed her own ex-body with me in it, damn her, just as she
   did before - just as she did, or it did before - " Edward's face was
   now atrociously distorted, and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine
   as his voice fell to a whisper.

   "You must know what I hinted in the car - that she isn't Asenath at
   all, but really old Ephraim himself. I suspected it a year and a half
   ago, and I know it now. Her handwriting shows it when she goes off
   guard - sometimes she jots down a note in writing that's just like her
   father's manuscripts, stroke for stroke - and sometimes she says things
   that nobody but an old man like Ephraim could say. He changed forms
   with her when he felt death coming - she was the only one he could find
   with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will - he got her body
   permanently, just as she almost got mine, and then poisoned the old
   body he'd put her into. Haven't you seen old Ephraim's soul glaring out
   of that she-devil's eyes dozens of times - and out of mine when she has
   control of my body?"

   The whisperer was panting, and paused for breath. I said nothing; and
   when he resumed his voice was nearer normal. This, I reflected, was a
   case for the asylum, but I would not be the one to send him there.
   Perhaps time and freedom from Asenath would do its work. I could see
   that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again.

   "I'll tell you more later - I must have a long rest now. I'll tell you
   something of the forbidden horrors she led me into - something of the
   age-old horrors that even now are festering in out-of-the-way corners
   with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive. Some people know
   things about the universe that nobody ought to know, and can do things
   that nobody ought to be able to do. I've been in it up to my neck, but
   that's the end. Today I'd burn that damned Necronomicon and all the
   rest if I were librarian at Miskatonic.

   "But she can't get me now. I must get out of that accursed house as
   soon as I can, and settle down at home. You'll help me, I know, if I
   need help. Those devilish servants, you know - and if people should get
   too inquisitive about Asenath. You see, I can't give them her
   address... Then there are certain groups of searchers - certain cults,
   you know - that might misunderstand our breaking up... some of them
   have damnably curious ideas and methods. I know you'll stand by me if
   anything happens - even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock
   you..."

   I had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest-chambers that night,
   and in the morning he seemed calmer. We discussed certain possible
   arrangements for his moving back into the Derby mansion, and I hoped he
   would lose no time in making the change. He did not call the next
   evening, but I saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks. We talked
   as little as possible about strange and unpleasant things, but
   discussed the renovation of the old Derby house, and the travels which
   Edward promised to take with my son and me the following summer.

   Of Asenath we said almost nothing, for I saw that the subject was a
   peculiarly disturbing one. Gossip, of course, was rife; but that was no
   novelty in connection with the strange menage at the old Crowninshield
   house. One thing I did not like was what Derby's banker let fall in an
   over-expansive mood at the Miskatonic Club - about the cheques Edward
   was sending regularly to a Moses and Abigail Sargent and a Eunice
   Babson in Innsmouth. That looked as if those evil-faced servants were
   extorting some kind of tribute from him - yet he had not mentioned the
   matter to me.

   I wished that the summer - and my son's Harvard vacation - would come,
   so that we could get Edward to Europe. He was not, I soon saw, mending
   as rapidly as I had hoped he would; for there was something a bit
   hysterical in his occasional exhilaration, while his moods of fright
   and depression were altogether too frequent. The old Derby house was
   ready by December, yet Edward constantly put off moving. Though he
   hated and seemed to fear the Crowninshield place, he was at the same
   time queerly enslaved by it. He could not seem to begin dismantling
   things, and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action. When I
   pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened. His
   father's old butler - who was there with other reacquired servants -
   told me one day that Edward's occasional prowlings about the house, and
   especially down cellar, looked odd and unwholesome to him. I wondered
   if Asenath had been writing disturbing letters, but the butler said
   there was no mail which could have come from her.

   It was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling
   on me. I was steering the conversation toward next summer's travels
   when he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of
   shocking, uncontrollable fright - a cosmic panic and loathing such as
   only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind.

   "My brain! My brain! God, Dan - it's tugging - from beyond - knocking -
   clawing - that she-devil - even now - Ephraim - Kamog! Kamog! - The pit
   of the shoggoths - Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand
   Young!...

   "The flame - the flame - beyond body, beyond life - in the earth - oh,
   God!"

   I pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as
   his frenzy sank to a dull apathy. He did not resist, but kept his lips
   moving as if talking to himself. Presently I realized that he was
   trying to talk to me, and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble
   words.

   "Again, again - she's trying - I might have known - nothing can stop
   that force; not distance nor magic, nor death - it comes and comes,
   mostly in the night - I can't leave - it's horrible - oh, God, Dan, if
   you only knew as I do just how horrible it is..."

   When he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and
   let normal sleep overtake him. I did not call a doctor, for I knew what
   would be said of his sanity, and wished to give nature a chance if I
   possibly could. He waked at midnight, and I put him to bed upstairs,
   but he was gone by morning. He had let himself quietly out of the house
   - and his butler, when called on the wire, said he was at home pacing
   about the library.

   Edward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but I
   went daily to see him. He would always be sitting in his library,
   staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening. Sometimes
   he talked rationally, but always on trivial topics. Any mention of his
   trouble, of future plans, or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy.
   His butler said he had frightful seizures at night, during which he
   might eventually do himself harm.

   I had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took
   the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms
   that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable - and
   that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the Arkham
   Sanitarium. I was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly -
   almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks, awesome whispers, and
   dreadful, droning repetitions of such phrases as "I had to do it - I
   had to do it - it'll get me - it'll get me - down there - down there in
   the dark - Mother! Mother! Dan! Save me - save me -"

   How much hope of recovery there was, no one could say, but I tried my
   best to be optimistic. Edward must have a home if he emerged, so I
   transferred his servants to the Derby mansion, which would surely be
   his sane choice. What to do about the Crowninshield place with its
   complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I
   could not decide, so left it momentarily untouched - telling the Derby
   household to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week, and ordering
   the furnace man to have a fire on those days.

   The final nightmare came before Candlemas - heralded, in cruel irony,
   by a false gleam of hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium
   telephoned to report that Edward's reason had suddenly come back. His
   continuous memory, they said, was badly impaired; but sanity itself was
   certain. Of course he must remain some time for observation, but there
   could be little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely
   be free in a week.

   I hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a
   nurse took me to Edward's room. The patient rose to greet me, extending
   his hand with a polite smile; but I saw in an instant that he bore the
   strangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own
   nature - the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible, and
   which Edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife.
   There was the same blazing vision - so like Asenath's and old Ephraim's
   - and the same firm mouth; and when he spoke I could sense the same
   grim, pervasive irony in his voice - the deep irony so redolent of
   potential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the
   night five months before - the person I had not seen since that brief
   call when he had forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such
   nebulous fears in me - and now he filled me with the same dim feeling
   of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness.

   He spoke affably of arrangements for release - and there was nothing
   for me to do but assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent
   memories. Yet I felt that something was terribly, inexplicably wrong
   and abnormal. There were horrors in this thing that I could not reach.
   This was a sane person - but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had
   known? If not, who or what was it - and where was Edward? Ought it to
   be free or confined - or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the
   earth? There was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the
   creature said - the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling
   mockery to certain words about the early liberty earned by an
   especially close confinement! I must have behaved very awkwardly, and
   was glad to beat a retreat.

   All that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had
   happened? What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in
   Edward's face? I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma,
   and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning
   the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged,
   and by evening I was close to a nervous collapse-a state I admit,
   though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision. I have nothing
   to say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for
   all the evidence.

V[edit]

   It was in the night-after that second evening - that stark, utter
   horror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black, clutching
   panic from which it can never shake free. It began with a telephone
   call just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took
   down the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and
   I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint
   suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under great
   difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of
   half-liquid bubbling noise - "glub... glub... glub" - which had an odd
   suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and syllable divisions.
   I called "Who is it?" But the only answer was "glub... glub...
   glub-glub." I could only assume that the noise was mechanical; but
   fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive
   but not to send, I added, "I can't hear you. Better hang up and try
   Information." Immediately I heard the receiver go on the hook at the
   other end.

   This, I say, was just about midnight. When the call was traced
   afterward it was found to come from the old Crowninshield house, though
   it was fully half a week from the housemaid's day to be there. I shall
   only hint what was found at that house - the upheaval in a remote
   cellar storeroom, the tracks, the dirt, the hastily rifled wardrobe,
   the baffling marks on the telephone, the clumsily used stationery, and
   the detestable stench lingering over everything. The police, poor
   fools, have their smug little theories, and are still searching for
   those sinister discharged servants - who have dropped out of sight
   amidst the present furore. They speak of a ghoulish revenge for things
   that were done, and say I was included because I was Edward's best
   friend and adviser.

   Idiots! Do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that
   handwriting? Do they fancy they could have brought what later came? Are
   they blind to the changes in that body that was Edward's? As for me, I
   now believe all that Edward Derby ever told me. There are horrors
   beyond life's edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while man's
   evil prying calls them just within our range. Ephraim - Asenath - that
   devil called them in, and they engulfed Edward as they are engulfing
   me.

   Can I be sure that I am safe? Those powers survive the life of the
   physical form. The next day - in the afternoon, when I pulled out of my
   prostration and was able to walk and talk coherently - I went to the
   madhouse and shot him dead for Edward's and the world's sake, but can I
   be sure till he is cremated? They are keeping the body for some silly
   autopsies by different doctors - but I say he must be cremated. He must
   be cremated - he who was not Edward Derby when I shot him. I shall go
   mad if he is not, for I may be the next. But my will is not weak - and
   I shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething
   around it. One life - Ephraim, Asenath, and Edward - who now? I will
   not be driven out of my body... I will not change souls with that
   bullet-ridden lich in the madhouse!

   But let me try to tell coherently of that final horror. I will not
   speak of what the police persistently ignored - the tales of that
   dwarfed, grotesque, malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers in
   High Street just before two o'clock, and the nature of the single
   footprints in certain places. I will say only that just about two the
   doorbell and knocker waked me - doorbell and knocker both, aplied
   alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation, and each
   trying to keep Edward's old signal of three-and-two strokes.

   Roused from sound sleep, my mind leaped into a turmoil. Derby at the
   door - and remembering the old code! That new personality had not
   remembered it... was Edward suddenly back in his rightful state? Why
   was he here in such evident stress and haste? Had he been released
   ahead of time, or had he escaped? Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a
   robe and bounded downstairs, his return to his own self had brought
   raving and violence, revoking his discharge and driving him to a
   desperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he was good old
   Edward again, and I would help him!

   When I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of
   insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea,
   and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed, humped figure on the steps.
   The summons had been Edward's, but who was this foul, stunted parody?
   Where had Edward had time to go? His ring had sounded only a second
   before the door opened.

   The caller had on one of Edward's overcoats - its bottom almost
   touching the ground, and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the
   hands. On the head was a slouch hat pulled low, while a black silk
   muffler concealed the face. As I stepped unsteadily forward, the figure
   made a semi-liquid sound like that I had heard over the telephone -
   "glub... glub..." - and thrust at me a large, closely written paper
   impaled on the end of a long pencil. Still reeling from the morbid and
   unaccountable foetor, I seized the paper and tried to read it in the
   light from the doorway.

   Beyond question, it was in Edward's script. But why had he written when
   he was close enough to ring - and why was the script so awkward, coarse
   and shaky? I could make out nothing in the dim half light, so edged
   back into the hall, the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but
   pausing on the inner door's threshold. The odour of this singular
   messenger was really appalling, and I hoped (not in vain, thank God!)
   that my wife would not wake and confront it.

   Then, as I read the paper, I felt my knees give under me and my vision
   go black. I was lying on the floor when I came to, that accursed sheet
   still clutched in my fear-rigid hand. This is what it said.

   "Dan - go to the sanitarium and kill it. Exterminate it. It isn't
   Edward Derby any more. She got me - it's Asenath - and she has been
   dead three months and a half. I lied when I said she had gone away. I
   killed her. I had to. It was sudden, but we were alone and I was in my
   right body. I saw a candlestick and smashed her head in. She would have
   got me for good at Hallowmass.

   "I buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and
   cleaned up all the traces. The servants suspected next morning, but
   they have such secrets that they dare not tell the police. I sent them
   off, but God knows what they - and others of the cult - will do.

   "I thought for a while I was all right, and then I felt the tugging at
   my brain. I knew what it was - I ought to have remembered. A soul like
   hers - or Ephraim's - is half detached, and keeps right on after death
   as long as the body lasts. She was getting me - making me change bodies
   with her-seizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers buried
   in the cellar.

   "I knew what was coming - that's why I snapped and had to go to the
   asylum. Then it came - I found myself choked in the dark - in Asenath's
   rotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where I put
   it. And I knew she must be in my body at the sanitarium - permanently,
   for it was after Hallowmass, and the sacrifice would work even without
   her being there - sane, and ready for release as a menace to the world.
   I was desperate, and in spite of everything I clawed my way out.

   "I'm too far gone to talk - I couldn't manage to telephone - but I can
   still write. I'll get fixed up somehow and bring this last word and
   warning. Kill that fiend if you value the peace and comfort of the
   world. See that it is cremated. If you don't, it will live on and on,
   body to body forever, and I can't tell you what it will do. Keep clear
   of black magic, Dan, it's the devil's business. Goodbye - you've been a
   great friend. Tell the police whatever they'll believe - and I'm
   damnably sorry to drag all this on you. I'll be at peace before long -
   this thing won't hold together much more. Hope you can read this. And
   kill that thing - kill it.

   Yours - Ed."

   It was only afterward that I read the last half of this paper, for I
   had fainted at the end of the third paragraph. I fainted again when I
   saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had
   struck it. The messenger would not move or have consciousness any more.

   The butler, tougher-fibred than I, did not faint at what met him in the
   hall in the morning. Instead, he telephoned the police. When they came
   I had been taken upstairs to bed, but the - other mass - lay where it
   had collapsed in the night. The men put handkerchiefs to their noses.

   What they finally found inside Edward's oddly-assorted clothes was
   mostly liquescent horror. There were bones, too - and a crushed-in
   skull. Some dental work positively identified the skull as Asenath's.

   4117The TombH. P. Lovecraft

             "Sedibus ut saltem placidis in morte quiescam."^[1]
                                                        --Virgil

         In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement
   within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present
   position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my
   narrative. It is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too
   limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence
   those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically
   sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience. Men of broader
   intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and
   the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the
   delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made
   conscious of them; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns
   as madness the flashes of super-sight which penetrate the common veil
   of obvious empiricism.

         My name is Jervas Dudley, and from earliest childhood I have been
   a dreamer and a visionary. Wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial
   life, and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social
   recreations of my acquaintances, I have dwelt ever in realms apart from
   the visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and
   little-known books, and in roaming the fields and groves of the region
   near my ancestral home. I do not think that what I read in these books
   or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and
   saw there; but of this I must say little, since detailed speech would
   but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which I sometimes
   overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me. It is
   sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causes.

         I have said that I dwelt apart from the visible world, but I have
   not said that I dwelt alone. This no human creature may do; for lacking
   the fellowship of the living, he inevitably draws upon the
   companionship of things that are not, or are no longer, living. Close
   by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow, in whose twilight deeps
   I spent most of my time; reading, thinking and dreaming. Down its
   moss-covered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken, and around
   its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were
   woven. Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and
   often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of
   waning moon--but of these things I must not now speak. I will tell only
   of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted
   tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct
   descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before
   my birth.

         The vault to which I refer is an ancient granite, weathered and
   discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations. Excavated back
   into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance. The
   door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron
   hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of
   heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half
   a century ago. The abode of the race whose scions are inurned had once
   crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen
   victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of
   lightning. Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion,
   the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and
   uneasy voices; alluding to what they call "divine wrath" in a manner
   that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination
   which I felt for the forest-darkened sepulchre. One man only had
   perished in the fire. When the last of the Hydes was buried in this
   place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a
   distant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned
   down. No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few
   care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely
   about the water-worn stones.

         I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the
   half-hidden house of the dead. It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy
   of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost
   homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated
   with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable
   odours of the soil and the vegetation. In such surroundings the mind
   loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and
   echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the
   enthralled consciousness. All day I had been wandering through the
   mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and
   conversing with things I need not name. In years a child of ten, I had
   seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged
   in certain respects. When, upon forcing my way between two savage
   clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I
   had no knowledge of what I had discovered. The dark blocks of granite,
   the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch,
   arounsed in me no associations of mournful or terrible character. Of
   graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had on account of my
   peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with
   churchyards and cemeteries. The strange stone house on the woodland
   slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its
   cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so
   tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay. But in
   that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which
   has brought me to this hell of confinement. Spurred on by a voice which
   must have come from the hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter
   the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my
   passage. In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty
   impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to
   squeeze my slight form through the space already provided; but neither
   plan met with success. At first curious, I was now frantic; and when in
   the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the
   hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an
   entrance to the black chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The
   physician with the iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room once
   told a visitor that this decision marked the beginnings of a pitiful
   monomania; but I will leave final judgement to my readers when they
   shall have learnt all.

         The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts
   to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in
   carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the
   structure. With the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy, I
   learned much; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one
   of my information or my resolve. It is perhaps worth mentioning that I
   was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the
   vault. My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me
   to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion;
   and I felt that the great sinister family of the burned-down mansion
   was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore.
   Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in
   the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb,
   before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day. Once I
   thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see
   nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward. The odour
   of the place repelled yet bewitched me. I felt I had known it before,
   in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the
   body I now possess.

         The year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a
   worm-eaten translation of Plutarch's Lives in the book-filled attic of
   my home. Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that
   passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to
   find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift
   its enourmous weight. This legend had the effect of dispelling my
   keenest impatience to enter the vault, for it made me feel that the
   time was not yet ripe. Later, I told myself, I should grow to a
   strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily
   chained door with ease; but until then I would do better by conforming
   to what seemed the will of Fate.

         Accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent,
   and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits.
   I would sometimes rise very quietly in the night, stealing out to walk
   in those churchyards and places of burial from which I had been kept by
   my parents. What I did there I may not say, for I am not now sure of
   the reality of certain things; but I know that on the day after such a
   nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about me with my
   knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations. It was after
   a night like this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit
   about the burial of the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of
   local history who was interred in 1711, and whose slate headstone,
   bearing a graven skull and crossbones, was slowly crumbling to power.
   In a moment of childish imagination I vowed not only that the
   undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had stolen the silver-buckled shoes,
   silken hose, and satin small-clothes of the deceased before burial; but
   that the Squire himself, not fully inanimate, had turned twice in his
   mound-covered coffin on the day of interment.

         But the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being
   indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discover that my own
   maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly
   extinct family of the Hydes. Last of my paternal race, I was likewise
   the last of this older and more mysterious line. I began to feel that
   the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time
   when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone
   steps in the dark. I now formed the habit of listening very intently at
   the slightly open portal, choosing my favourite hours of midnight
   stillness for the odd vigil. By the time I came of age, I had made a
   small clearing in the thicket before the mould-stained facade of the
   hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang
   the space like the walls and roof of sylvan bower. This bower was my
   temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched
   on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange
   dreams.

         The night of the first revelation was a sultry one. I must have
   fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of
   awakening that I heard the voices. Of those tones and accents I
   hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I may say
   that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary,
   pronunciation, and mode of utterance. Every shade of New England
   dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the
   precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy
   colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact. At the
   time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another
   phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not take oath upon
   its reality. I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been
   hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre. I do not think I
   was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly
   and permanently changed that night. Upon returning home I went with
   much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the
   key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed
   in vain.

         It was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered
   the vault on the abandoned slope. A spell was upon me, and my heart
   leaped with an exultation I can but ill describe. As I closed the door
   behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone
   candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with
   the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty,
   charnel-house air. Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing
   coffins, or the remains of coffins. Some of these were sealed and
   intact, but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and
   plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust. Upon one
   plate I read the name of Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in
   1640 and died here a few years later. In a conspicuous alcove was one
   fairly well-preserved and untenanted casket, adorned with a single name
   which brought to me both a smile and a shudder. An odd impulse caused
   me to climb upon the broad slab, extinguish my candle, and lie down
   within the vacant box.

         In the grey light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked
   the chain of the door behind me. I was no longer a young man, though
   but twenty-one winters had chilled my bodily frame. Early-rising
   villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and
   marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose
   life was known to be sober and solitary. I did not appear before my
   parents till after a long and refreshing sleep.

         Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and
   doing things I must never reveal. My speech, always susceptible to
   environmental influences, was the first thing to succumb to the change;
   and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon.
   Later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till I
   unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite
   my lifelong seclusion. My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the
   easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester. I
   displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish
   lore over which I had pored in youth; and covered the flyleaves of my
   books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of
   Gay, Prior, and the sprightliest of Augustan wits and rimesters. One
   morning at breakfast I came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably
   liquourish accents an effusion of eighteenth-century Bacchanalian
   mirth; a bit of Georgian playfulness never recorded in a book, which
   ran something like this:

   Come hither, my lads, with your tankards of ale,
   And drink to the present before it shall fail;
   Pile each on your platter a mountain of beef,
   For 'tis eating and drinking that bring us relief:
   So fill up your glass,
   So life will soon pass;
   When you're dead ye'll ne'er drink to your king or your lass!
   Anacreon had a red nose, so they say;
   But what's a red nose if ye're happy and gay?
   Gad split me! I'd rather be red whilst I'm here,
   Than white as a lily--and dead half a year!
   So Betty, my miss,
   Come give me kiss;
   In hell there's no innkeeper's daughter like this!
   Young Harry, propp'd up just as straight as he's able,
   Will soon lose his wig and slip under the table;
   But fill up your goblets and pass 'em around--
   Better under the table than under the ground!
   So revel and chaff
   As ye thirstily quaff:
   Under six feet of dirt 'tis less easy to laugh!
   The fiend strike me blue! I'm scarce able to walk,
   And damn me if I can stand upright or talk!
   Here, landlord, bid Betty to summon a chair;
   I'll try home for a while, for my wife is not there!
   So lend me a hand;
   I'm not able to stand,
   But I'm gay whilst I linger on top of the land!

         About this time I conceived my present fear of fire and
   thunderstorms. Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an
   unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses
   of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display. A
   favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the
   mansion that had burned down, and in fancy I would picture the
   structure as it had been in its prime. On one occasion I startled a
   villager by leading him confidently to a shallow sub-cellar, of whose
   existence I seemed to know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen
   and forgotten for many generations.

         At last came that which I had long feared. My parents, alarmed at
   the altered manner and appearance of their only son, commenced to exert
   over my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in
   disaster. I had told no one of my visits to the tomb, having guarded my
   secret purpose with religious zeal since childhood; but now I was
   forced to exercise care in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow,
   that I might throw off a possible pursuer. My key to the vault I kept
   suspended from a cord about my neck, its presence known only to me. I
   never carried out of the sepulchre any of the things I came upon whilst
   within its walls.

         One morning as I emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the
   chain of the portal with none too steady hand, I beheld in an adjacent
   thicket the dreaded face of a watcher. Surely the end was near; for my
   bower was discovered, and the objective of my nocturnal journeys
   revealed. The man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to
   overhear what he might report to my careworn father. Were my sojourns
   beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world? Imagine my
   delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in cautious
   whisper that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my
   sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal
   stood ajar! By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was
   now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me. Made bold by
   this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in
   going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance.
   For a week I tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality
   which I must not describe, when the thing happened, and I was borne
   away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony.

         I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of
   thunder was in the clouds, and hellish phosphorescence rose from the
   rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow. The call of the dead, too, was
   different. Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on
   the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with
   unseen fingers. As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain
   before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always
   vaguely expected. The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its
   stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the
   splendour of many candles. Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the
   Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered
   exquisites from the neighbouring mansions. With this throng I mingled,
   though I knew I belonged with the hosts rather than the guests. Inside
   the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand. Several faces I
   recognised; though I should have known them better had they been
   shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition. Amidst a wild and
   reckless throng I was the wildest and most abandoned. Gay blasphemy
   poured in torrents from my lips, and in my shocking sallies I heeded no
   law of God, Man, or Nature. Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even
   above the din of the swinish revelry, clave the very roof and laid a
   hush of fear upon the boisterous company. Red tongues of flame and
   searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the roysterers, struck
   with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the
   bounds of unguided Nature, fled shrieking into the night. I alone
   remained, riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which I had never
   felt before. And then a second horror took possession of my soul. Burnt
   alive to ashes, my body dispersed by the four winds, I might never lie
   in the tomb of Hydes! Was not my coffin prepared for me? Had I not a
   right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of Sir Geoffrey
   Hyde? Aye! I would claim my heritage of death, even though my soul go
   seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to represent it
   on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault. Jervas Hyde should
   never share the sad fate of Palinurus!

         As the phantom of the burning house faded, I found myself
   screaming and struggling madly in the arms of two men, one of whom was
   the spy who had followed me to the tomb. Rain was pouring down in
   torrents, and upon the southern horizon were flashes of the lightning
   that had so lately passed over our heads. My father, his face lined
   with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my demands to be laid within the
   tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they
   could. A blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a
   violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious
   villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship
   which the thunderbolt had brought to light. Ceasing my futile and now
   objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as they viewed the
   treasure-trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries. The
   box, whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it,
   contained many papers and objects of value; but I had eyes for one
   thing alone. It was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly
   curled bag-wig, and bore the initials "J.H." The face was such that as
   I gazed, I might well have been studying my mirror.

         On the following day I was brought to this room with the barred
   windows, but I have been kept informed of certain things through an
   aged and simple-minded servitor, for whom I bore a fondness in infancy,
   and who like me loves the churchyard. What I have dared relate of my
   experiences within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles. My
   father, who visits me frequently, declares that at no time did I pass
   the chained portal, and swears that the rusted padlock had not been
   touched for fifty years when he examined it. He even says that all the
   village knew of my journeys to the tomb, and that I was often watched
   as I slept in the bower outside the grim facade, my half-open eyes
   fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior. Against these
   assertions I have no tangible proof to offer, since my key to the
   padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors. The strange
   things of the past which I learnt during those nocturnal meetings with
   the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and omnivorous
   browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library. Had it not
   been for my old servant Hiram, I should have by this time become quite
   convinced of my madness.

         But Hiram, loyal to the last, has held faith in me, and has done
   that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story. A week
   ago he burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb
   perpetually ajar, and descended with a lantern into the murky depths.
   On a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished
   plate bears the single word "Jervas". In that coffin and in that vault
   they have promised me I shall be buried.

   The Transition of Juan Romero
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   14846The Transition of Juan RomeroH. P. Lovecraft

   Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October eighteenth
   and nineteenth, 1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to
   science is all that impels me to recall, in the last years of my life,
   scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I
   cannot wholly define it. But I believe that before I die I should tell
   what I know of the - shall I say transition - of Juan Romero.

   My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy
   it is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates
   to the States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him. Besides,
   what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save
   perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home
   amongst white-bearded native teachers than amongst my brother-officers.
   I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the
   calamities which brought about my new life in America's vast West - a
   life wherein I found it well to accept a name - my present one - which
   is very common and carries no meaning.

   In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the
   Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated
   Norton Mine, whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before
   had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a
   seething cauldron of sordid life. A cavern of gold, lying deep beneath
   a mountain lake, had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest
   dreams, and now formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on
   the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold.
   Additional grottoes had been found, and the yield of yellow metal was
   exceedingly great; so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners
   toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows. The
   Superintendent, a Mr. Arthur, often discussed the singularity of the
   local geological formations; speculating on the probable extent of the
   chain of caves, and estimating the future of the titanic mining
   enterprises. He considered the auriferous cavities the result of the
   action of water, and believed the last of them would soon be opened.

   It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came
   to the Norton Mine. One of the large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted
   thither from the neighbouring country, he at first attracted attention
   only because of his features; which though plainly of the Red Indian
   type, were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined
   conformation, being vastly unlike those of the average "greaser" or
   Piute of the locality. It is curious that although he differed so
   widely from the mass of Hispanicised and tribal Indians, Romero gave
   not the least impression of Caucasian blood. It was not the Castilian
   conquistador or the American pioneer, but the ancient and noble Aztec,
   whom imagination called to view when the silent peon would rise in the
   early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it crept above the
   eastern hills, meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in
   the performance of some rite whose nature he did not himself
   comprehend. But save for his face, Romero was not in any way suggestive
   of nobility. Ignorant and dirty, he was at home amongst the other
   brown-skinned Mexicans; having come (so I was afterward told) from the
   very lowest sort of surroundings. He had been found as a child in a
   crude mountain hut, the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked
   lethally by. Near the hut, close to a rather unusual rock fissure, had
   lain two skeletons, newly picked by vultures, and presumably forming
   the sole remains of his parents. No one recalled their identity, and
   they were soon forgotten by the many. Indeed, the crumbling of the
   adobe hut and the closing of the rock-fissure by a subsequent avalanche
   had helped to efface even the scene from recollection. Reared by a
   Mexican cattle-thief who had given him his name, Juan differed little
   from his fellows.

   The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly
   commenced through the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when
   not engaged in active labour. Of its nature, and manner of coming into
   my possession, I cannot speak. It was my last link with a chapter of my
   life forever closed, and I valued it highly. Soon I observed that the
   odd-looking Mexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an
   expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness. Its hoary
   hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but
   active mind, though he could not possibly have beheld their like
   before. Within a few weeks after his advent, Romero was like a faithful
   servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact that I was myself but an
   ordinary miner. Our conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but a
   few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something
   quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain.

   The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long
   premonitions. Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my
   ring had affected him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any
   expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off.
   Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine
   directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and
   the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be
   encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite.
   With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first
   knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others. The charge,
   heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire
   mountain. Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by
   the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked
   from their feet. Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action,
   heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss
   yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous
   that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it.
   Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent,
   who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced
   and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered.

   Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of
   their failure. Firmly though respectfully, they signified their refusal
   to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it
   might be sealed. Something beyond their experience was evidently
   confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below
   was infinite. The Superintendent did not reproach them. Instead, he
   pondered deeply, and made plans for the following day. The night shift
   did not go on that evening.

   At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl
   dismally. From somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer;
   either to the coyote - or to something else. A storm was gathering
   around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded
   horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a
   gibbous moon's attempts to shine through many layers of cirro-stratus
   vapours. It was Romero's voice, coming from the bunk above, that
   awakened me, a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation I
   could not understand:

   "Madre de Dios! - el sonido - ese sonido - oiga Vd! - lo oye Vd? -
   señor, THAT SOUND!"

   I listened, wondering what sound he meant. The coyote, the dog, the
   storm, all were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the
   wind shrieked more and more frantically. Flashes of lightning were
   visible through the bunk-house window. I questioned the nervous
   Mexican, repeating the sounds I had heard:

   "El coyote - el perro - el viento?"

   But Romero did not reply. Then he commenced whispering as in awe:

   "El ritmo, señor - el ritmo de la tierra - THAT THROB DOWN IN THE
   GROUND!"

   And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why. Deep,
   deep, below me was a sound - a rhythm, just as the peon had said -
   which, though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the
   coyote, and the increasing tempest. To seek to describe it was useless
   - for it was such that no description is possible. Perhaps it was like
   the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner, as sensed from
   the deck, yet it was not so mechanical; not so devoid of the element of
   the life and consciousness. Of all its qualities, remoteness in the
   earth most impressed me. To my mind rushed fragments of a passage in
   Joseph Glanvil which Poe has quoted with tremendous effect^[1]:

   "..... the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works,
   which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus."

   Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk, pausing before me to gaze at the
   strange ring on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of
   lightning, and then staring intently in the direction of the mine
   shaft. I also rose, and both of us stood motionless for a time,
   straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take
   on a vital quality. Then without apparent volition we began to move
   toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comforting
   suggestion of earthly reality. The chanting in the depths - for such
   the sound now seemed to be - grew in volume and distinctness; and we
   felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping
   blackness of the shaft.

   We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had
   been released from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement
   pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender. From
   the watchman's cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light
   like a guardian eye. I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had
   affected the watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I
   followed without pausing.

   As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite.
   It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating
   of drums and chanting of many voices. I have, as you are aware, been
   much in India. Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through
   drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet
   ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance. At one time I
   fancied I had gone mad - this was when, on wondering how our way was
   lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realized that the ancient
   ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid
   lustre through the damp, heavy air around.

   It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the
   many wide ladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and
   wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me,
   had acted on him in a startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he
   forged ahead unguided in the cavern's gloom. I heard his repeated
   shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and
   scrambled madly down the rickety ladders. And frightened as I was, I
   yet retained enough of my perception to note that his speech, when
   articulate, was not of any sort known to me. Harsh but impressive
   polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and
   worse English, and of these, only the oft repeated cry
   "Huitzilopotchli" seemed in the least familiar. Later I definitely
   placed that word in the works of a great historian^[2] - and shuddered
   when the association came to me.

   The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief,
   beginning just as I reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the
   darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which
   was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear
   again and survive. In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden
   terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort
   to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously the light from my ring was
   extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a
   few yards ahead of me. I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly
   aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero.
   Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could
   fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous
   uproar. At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity;
   but then shapes, all infinitely distant, began to detach themselves
   from the confusion, and I saw - was it Juan Romero? - but God! I dare
   not tell you what I saw! ...Some power from heaven, coming to my aid,
   obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when
   two universes collide in space. Chaos supervened, and I knew the peace
   of oblivion.

   I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are
   involved; but I will do my best, not even trying to differentiate
   betwixt the real and the apparent. When I awakened, I was safe in my
   bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window. Some distance
   away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a
   group of men, including the camp doctor. The men were discussing the
   strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly
   connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had
   struck and shaken the mountain. No direct cause was evident, and an
   autopsy failed to show any reason why Romero should not be living.
   Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero
   nor I had left the bunk-house during the night; that neither of us had
   been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus
   range. That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had
   caused extensive caving-in, and had completely closed the deep abyss
   which had created so much apprehension the day before. When I asked the
   watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunder-bolt; he
   mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarling mountain wind - nothing
   more. Nor do I doubt his word.

   Upon the resumption of work, Superintendent Arthur called upon some
   especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot
   where the gulf had appeared. Though hardly eager, they obeyed, and a
   deep boring was made. Results were very curious. The roof of the void,
   as seen when it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the
   drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent
   of solid rock. Finding nothing else, not even gold, the Superintendent
   abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over
   his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk.

   One other thing is curious. Shortly after waking on that morning after
   the storm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from
   my finger. I had prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation
   of relief at its disappearance. If one of my fellow-miners appropriated
   it, he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty, for
   despite advertisements and a police search, the ring was never seen
   again. Somehow I doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands, for many
   strange things were taught me in India.

   My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time. In broad
   daylight, and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it
   a mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning
   when the winds and animals howl dismally, there comes from
   inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical
   throbbing ...and I feel that the transition of Juan Romero was a
   terrible one indeed.

   739751The TrapH. P. Lovecraft and Henry S. Whitehead

   It was on a certain Thursday morning in December that the whole thing
   began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique
   Copenhagen mirror. Something, it seemed to me, stirred--something
   reflected in the glass, though I was alone in my quarters. I paused and
   looked intently, then, deciding that the effect must be a pure
   illusion, resumed the interrupted brushing of my hair.

   I had discovered the old mirror, covered with dust and cobwebs, in an
   outbuilding of an abandoned estate-house in Santa Cruz's sparsely
   settled Northside territory, and had brought it to the United States
   from the Virgin Islands. The venerable glass was dim from more than two
   hundred years' exposure to a tropical climate, and the graceful
   ornamentation along the top of the gilt frame had been badly smashed. I
   had had the detached pieces set back into the frame before placing it
   in storage with my other belongings.

   Now, several years later, I was staying half as a guest and half as a
   tutor at the private school of my old friend Browne on a windy
   Connecticut hillside--occupying an unused wing in one of the
   dormitories, where I had two rooms and a hallway to myself. The old
   mirror, stowed securely in mattresses, was the first of my possessions
   to be unpacked on my arrival; and I had set it up majestically in the
   living-room, on top of an old rosewood console which had belonged to my
   great-grandmother.

   The door of my bedroom was just opposite that of the living-room, with
   a hallway between; and I had noticed that by looking into my chiffonier
   glass I could see the larger mirror through the two doorways--which was
   exactly like glancing down an endless, though diminishing, corridor. On
   this Thursday morning I thought I saw a curious suggestion of motion
   down that normally empty corridor--but, as I have said, soon dismissed
   the notion.

   When I reached the dining-room I found everyone complaining of the
   cold, and learned that the school's heating-plant was temporarily out
   of order. Being especially sensitive to low temperatures, I was myself
   an acute sufferer; and at once decided not to brave any freezing
   schoolroom that day. Accordingly I invited my class to come over to my
   living-room for an informal session around my grate-fire--a suggestion
   which the boys received enthusiastically.

   After the session one of the boys, Robert Grandison, asked if he might
   remain; since he had no appointment for the second morning period. I
   told him to stay, and welcome. He sat down to study in front of the
   fireplace in a comfortable chair.

   It was not long, however, before Robert moved to another chair somewhat
   farther away from the freshly replenished blaze, this change bringing
   him directly opposite the old mirror. From my own chair in another part
   of the room I noticed how fixedly he began to look at the dim, cloudy
   glass, and, wondering what so greatly interested him, was reminded of
   my own experience earlier that morning. As time passed he continued to
   gaze, a slight frown knitting his brows.

   At last I quietly asked him what had attracted his attention. Slowly,
   and still wearing the puzzled frown, he looked over and replied rather
   cautiously:

   "It's the corrugations in the glass--or whatever they are, Mr. Canevin.
   I was noticing how they all seem to run from a certain point.
   Look--I'll show you what I mean."

   The boy jumped up, went over to the mirror, and placed his finger on a
   point near its lower left-hand corner.

   "It's right here, sir," he explained, turning to look toward me and
   keeping his finger on the chosen spot.

   His muscular action in turning may have pressed his finger against the
   glass. Suddenly he withdrew his hand as though with some slight effort,
   and with a faintly muttered "Ouch." Then he looked at the glass in
   obvious mystification.

   "What happened?" I asked, rising and approaching.

   "Why--it--" He seemed embarrassed. "It--I--felt--well, as though it
   were pulling my finger into it. Seems--er--perfectly foolish, sir,
   but--well--it was a most peculiar sensation." Robert had an unusual
   vocabulary for his fifteen years.

   I came over and had him show me the exact spot he meant.

   "You'll think I'm rather a fool, sir," he said shamefacedly,
   "but--well, from right here I can't be absolutely sure. From the chair
   it seemed to be clear enough."

   Now thoroughly interested, I sat down in the chair Robert had occupied
   and looked at the spot he selected on the mirror. Instantly the thing
   "jumped out at me." Unmistakably, from that particular angle, all the
   many whorls in the ancient glass appeared to converge like a large
   number of spread strings held in one hand and radiating out in streams.

   Getting up and crossing to the mirror, I could no longer see the
   curious spot. Only from certain angles, apparently, was it visible.
   Directly viewed, that portion of the mirror did not even give back a
   normal reflection--for I could not see my face in it. Manifestly I had
   a minor puzzle on my hands.

   Presently the school gong sounded, and the fascinated Robert Grandison
   departed hurriedly, leaving me alone with my odd little problem in
   optics. I raised several window-shades, crossed the hallway, and sought
   for the spot in the chiffonier mirror's reflection. Finding it readily,
   I looked very intently and thought I again detected something of the
   "motion." I craned my neck, and at last, at a certain angle of vision,
   the thing again "jumped out at me."

   The vague "motion" was now positive and definite--an appearance of
   torsional movement, or of whirling; much like a minute yet intense
   whirlwind or waterspout, or a huddle of autumn leaves dancing
   circularly in an eddy of wind along a level lawn. It was, like the
   earth's, a double motion--around and around, and at the same time
   inward, as if the whorls poured themselves endlessly toward some point
   inside the glass. Fascinated, yet realizing that the thing must be an
   illusion, I grasped an impression of quite distinct suction, and
   thought of Robert's embarrassed explanation: "I felt as though it were
   pulling my finger into it."

   A kind of slight chill ran suddenly up and down my backbone. There was
   something here distinctly worth looking into. And as the idea of
   investigation came to me, I recalled the rather wistful expression of
   Robert Grandison when the gong called him to class. I remembered how he
   had looked back over his shoulder as he walked obediently out into the
   hallway, and resolved that he should be included in whatever analysis I
   might make of this little mystery.

   Exciting events connected with that same Robert, however, were soon to
   chase all thoughts of the mirror from my consciousness for a time. I
   was away all that afternoon, and did not return to the school until the
   five-fifteen "Call-Over"--a general assembly at which the boys'
   attendance was compulsory. Dropping in at this function with the idea
   of picking Robert up for a session with the mirror, I was astonished
   and pained to find him absent--a very unusual and unaccountable thing
   in his case. That evening Browne told me that the boy had actually
   disappeared, a search in his room, in the gymnasium, and in all other
   accustomed places being unavailing, though all his
   belongings--including his outdoor clothing--were in their proper
   places.

   He had not been encountered on the ice or with any of the hiking groups
   that afternoon, and telephone calls to all the school-catering
   merchants of the neighborhood were in vain. There was, in short, no
   record of his having been seen since the end of the lesson periods at
   two-fifteen; when he had turned up the stairs toward his room in
   Dormitory Number Three.

   When the disappearance was fully realized, the resulting sensation was
   tremendous throughout the school. Browne, as headmaster, had to bear
   the brunt of it; and such an unprecedented occurrence in his
   well-regulated, highly organized institution left him quite bewildered.
   It was learned that Robert had not run away to his home in western
   Pennsylvania, nor did any of the searching-parties of boys and masters
   find any trace of him in the snowy countryside around the school. So
   far as could be seen, he had simply vanished.

   Robert's parents arrived on the afternoon of the second day after his
   disappearance. They took their trouble quietly, though, of course, they
   were staggered by this unexpected disaster. Browne looked ten years
   older for it, but there was absolutely nothing that could be done. By
   the fourth day the case had settled down in the opinion of the school
   as an insoluble mystery. Mr. and Mrs. Grandison went reluctantly back
   to their home, and on the following morning the ten days' Christmas
   vacation began.

   Boys and masters departed in anything but the usual holiday spirit; and
   Browne and his wife were left, along with the servants, as my only
   fellow-occupants of the big place. Without the masters and boys it
   seemed a very hollow shell indeed.

   That afternoon I sat in front of my grate-fire thinking about Robert's
   disappearance and evolving all sorts of fantastic theories to account
   for it. By evening I had acquired a bad headache, and ate a light
   supper accordingly. Then, after a brisk walk around the massed
   buildings, I returned to my living-room and took up the burden of
   thought once more.

   A little after ten o'clock I awakened in my armchair, stiff and
   chilled, from a doze during which I had let the fire go out. I was
   physically uncomfortable, yet mentally aroused by a peculiar sensation
   of expectancy and possible hope. Of course it had to do with the
   problem that was harassing me. For I had started from that inadvertent
   nap with a curious, persistent idea--the odd idea that a tenuous,
   hardly recognizable Robert Grandison had been trying desperately to
   communicate with me. I finally went to bed with one conviction
   unreasoningly strong in my mind. Somehow I was sure that young Robert
   Grandison was still alive.

   That I should be receptive of such a notion will not seem strange to
   those who know my long residence in the West Indies and my close
   contact with unexplained happenings there. It will not seem strange,
   either, that I fell asleep with an urgent desire to establish some sort
   of mental communication with the missing boy. Even the most prosaic
   scientists affirm, with Freud, Jung, and Adler, that the subconscious
   mind is most open to external impressions in sleep; though such
   impressions are seldom carried over intact into the waking state.

   Going a step further and granting the existence of telepathic forces,
   it follows that such forces must act most strongly on a sleeper; so
   that if I were ever to get a definite message from Robert, it would be
   during a period of profoundest slumber. Of course, I might lose the
   message in waking; but my aptitude for retaining such things has been
   sharpened by types of mental discipline picked up in various obscure
   corners of the globe.

   I must have dropped asleep instantaneously, and from the vividness of
   my dreams and the absence of wakeful intervals I judge that my sleep
   was a very deep one. It was six-forty-five when I awakened, and there
   still lingered with me certain impressions which I knew were carried
   over from the world of somnolent cerebration. Filling my mind was the
   vision of Robert Grandison strangely transformed to a boy of a dull
   greenish dark-blue color; Robert desperately endeavoring to communicate
   with me by means of speech, yet finding some almost insuperable
   difficulty in so doing. A wall of curious spatial separation seemed to
   stand between him and me--a mysterious, invisible wall which completely
   baffled us both.

   I had seen Robert as though at some distance, yet queerly enough he
   seemed at the same time to be just beside me. He was both larger and
   smaller than in real life, his apparent size varying directly, instead
   of inversely, with the distance as he advanced and retreated in the
   course of conversation. That is, he grew larger instead of smaller to
   my eye when he stepped away or backwards, and vice versa; as if the
   laws of perspective in his case had been wholly reversed. His aspect
   was misty and uncertain--as if he lacked sharp or permanent outlines;
   and the anomalies of his coloring and clothing baffled me utterly at
   first.

   At some point in my dream Robert's vocal efforts had finally
   crystallized into audible speech--albeit speech of an abnormal
   thickness and dullness. I could not for a time understand anything he
   said, and even in the dream racked my brain for a clue to where he was,
   what he wanted to tell, and why his utterance was so clumsy and
   unintelligible. Then little by little I began to distinguish words and
   phrases, the very first of which sufficed to throw my dreaming self
   into the wildest excitement and to establish a certain mental
   connection which had previously refused to take conscious form because
   of the utter incredibility of what it implied.

   I do not know how long I listened to those halting words amidst my deep
   slumber, but hours must have passed while the strangely remote speaker
   struggled on with his tale. There was revealed to me such a
   circumstance as I cannot hope to make others believe without the
   strongest corroborative evidence, yet which I was quite ready to accept
   as truth--both in the dream and after waking--because of my former
   contacts with uncanny things. The boy was obviously watching my
   face--mobile in receptive sleep--as he choked along; for about the time
   I began to comprehend him, his own expression brightened and gave signs
   of gratitude and hope.

   Any attempt to hint at Robert's message, as it lingered in my ears
   after a sudden awakening in the cold, brings this narrative to a point
   where I must choose my words with the greatest care. Everything
   involved is so difficult to record that one tends to flounder
   helplessly. I have said that the revelation established in my mind a
   certain connection which reason had not allowed me to formulate
   consciously before. This connection, I need no longer hesitate to hint,
   had to do with the old Copenhagen mirror whose suggestions of motion
   had so impressed me on the morning of the disappearance, and whose
   whorl-like contours and apparent illusions of suction had later exerted
   such a disquieting fascination on both Robert and me.

   Resolutely, though my outer consciousness had previously rejected what
   my intuition would have liked to imply, it could reject that stupendous
   conception no longer. What was fantasy in the tale of "Alice" now came
   to me as a grave and immediate reality. That looking-glass had indeed
   possessed a malign, abnormal suction; and the struggling speaker in my
   dream made clear the extent to which it violated all the known
   precedents of human experience and all the age-old laws of our three
   sane dimensions. It was more than a mirror--it was a gate; a trap; a
   link with spatial recesses not meant for the denizens of our visible
   universe, and realizable only in terms of the most intricate
   non-Euclidean mathematics. And in some outrageous fashion Robert
   Grandison had passed out of our ken into the glass and was there
   immured, waiting for release.

   It is significant that upon awakening I harbored no genuine doubt of
   the reality of the revelation. That I had actually held conversation
   with a trans-dimensional Robert, rather than evoked the whole episode
   from my broodings about his disappearance and about the old illusions
   of the mirror, was as certain to my utmost instincts as any of the
   instinctive certainties commonly recognized as valid. The tale thus
   unfolded to me was of the most incredibly bizarre character. As had
   been clear on the morning of his disappearance, Robert was intensely
   fascinated by the ancient mirror. All through the hours of school, he
   had it in mind to come back to my living-room and examine it further.
   When he did arrive, after the close of the school day, it was somewhat
   later than two-twenty, and I was absent in town. Finding me out and
   knowing that I would not mind, he had come into my living-room and gone
   straight to the mirror; standing before it and studying the place
   where, as we had noted, the whorls appeared to converge.

   Then, quite suddenly, there had come to him an overpowering urge to
   place his hand upon this whorl-center. Almost reluctantly, against his
   better judgment, he had done so; and upon making the contact had felt
   at once the strange, almost painful suction which had perplexed him
   that morning. Immediately thereafter--quite without warning, but with a
   wrench which seemed to twist and tear every bone and muscle in his body
   and to bulge and press and cut at every nerve--he had been abruptly
   drawn through and found himself inside.

   Once through, the excruciatingly painful stress upon his entire system
   was suddenly released. He felt, he said, as though he had just been
   born--a feeling that made itself evident every time he tried to do
   anything; walk, stoop, turn his head, or utter speech. Everything about
   his body seemed a misfit.

   These sensations wore off after a long while, Robert's body becoming an
   organized whole rather than a number of protesting parts. Of all the
   forms of expression, speech remained the most difficult; doubtless
   because it is complicated, bringing into play a number of different
   organs, muscles, and tendons. Robert's feet, on the other hand, were
   the first members to adjust themselves to the new conditions within the
   glass.

   During the morning hours I rehearsed the whole reason-defying problem;
   correlating everything I had seen and heard, dismissing the natural
   scepticism of a man of sense, and scheming to devise possible plans for
   Robert's release from his incredible prison. As I did so a number of
   originally perplexing points became clear--or at least, clearer--to me.

   There was, for example, the matter of Robert's coloring. His face and
   hands, as I have indicated, were a kind of dull greenish dark-blue; and
   I may add that his familiar blue Norfolk jacket had turned to a pale
   lemon-yellow while his trousers remained a neutral gray as before.
   Reflecting on this after waking, I found the circumstance closely
   allied to the reversal of perspective which made Robert seem to grow
   larger when receding and smaller when approaching. Here, too, was a
   physical reversal--for every detail of his coloring in the unknown
   dimension was the exact reverse or complement of the corresponding
   color detail in normal life. In physics the typical complementary
   colors are blue and yellow, and red and green. These pairs are
   opposites, and when mixed yield gray. Robert's natural color was a
   pinkish-buff, the opposite of which is the greenish-blue I saw. His
   blue coat had become yellow, while the gray trousers remained gray.
   This latter point baffled me until I remembered that gray is itself a
   mixture of opposites. There is no opposite for gray--or rather, it is
   its own opposite.

   Another clarified point was that pertaining to Robert's curiously
   dulled and thickened speech--as well as to the general awkwardness and
   sense of misfit bodily parts of which he complained. This, at the
   outset, was a puzzle indeed; though after long thought the clue
   occurred to me. Here again was the same reversal which affected
   perspective and coloration. Anyone in the fourth dimension must
   necessarily be reversed in just this way--hands and feet, as well as
   colors and perspectives, being changed about. It would be the same with
   all the other dual organs, such as nostrils, ears, and eyes. Thus
   Robert had been talking with a reversed tongue, teeth, vocal cords, and
   kindred speech-apparatus; so that his difficulties in utterance were
   little to be wondered at.

   As the morning wore on, my sense of the stark reality and maddening
   urgency of the dream-disclosed situation increased rather than
   decreased. More and more I felt that something must be done, yet
   realized that I could not seek advice or aid. Such a story as mine--a
   conviction based upon mere dreaming--could not conceivably bring me
   anything but ridicule or suspicions as to my mental state. And what,
   indeed, could I do, aided or unaided, with as little working data as my
   nocturnal impressions had provided? I must, I finally recognized, have
   more information before I could even think of a possible plan for
   releasing Robert. This could come only through the receptive conditions
   of sleep, and it heartened me to reflect that according to every
   probability my telepathic contact would be resumed the moment I fell
   into deep slumber again.

   I accomplished sleeping that afternoon, after a midday dinner at which,
   through rigid self-control, I succeeded in concealing from Browne and
   his wife the tumultuous thoughts that crashed through my mind. Hardly
   had my eyes closed when a dim telepathic image began to appear; and I
   soon realized to my infinite excitement that it was identical with what
   I had seen before. If anything, it was more distinct; and when it began
   to speak I seemed able to grasp a greater proportion of the words.

   During this sleep I found most of the morning's deductions confirmed,
   though the interview was mysteriously cut off long prior to my
   awakening. Robert had seemed apprehensive just before communication
   ceased, but had already told me that in his strange fourth-dimensional
   prison colors and spatial relationships were indeed reversed--black
   being white, distance increasing apparent size, and so on. He had also
   intimated that, notwithstanding his possession of full physical form
   and sensations, most human vital properties seemed curiously suspended.
   Nutriment, for example, was quite unnecessary--a phenomenon really more
   singular than the omnipresent reversal of objects and attributes, since
   the latter was a reasonable and mathematically indicated state of
   things. Another significant piece of information was that the only exit
   from the glass to the world was the entrance-way, and that this was
   permanently barred and impenetrably sealed, so far as egress was
   concerned.

   That night I had another visitation from Robert; nor did such
   impressions, received at odd intervals while I slept receptively
   minded, cease during the entire period of his incarceration. His
   efforts to communicate were desperate and often pitiful; for at times
   the telepathic bond would weaken, while at other times fatigue,
   excitement, or fear of interruption would hamper and thicken his
   speech. I may as well narrate as a continuous whole all that Robert
   told me throughout the whole series of transient mental
   contacts--perhaps supplementing it at certain points with facts
   directly related after his release. The telepathic information was
   fragmentary and often nearly inarticulate, but I studied it over and
   over during the waking intervals of three intense days; classifying and
   cogitating with feverish diligence, since it was all that I had to go
   upon if the boy were to be brought back into our world.

   The fourth-dimensional region in which Robert found himself was not, as
   in scientific romance, an unknown and infinite realm of strange sights
   and fantastic denizens; but was rather a projection of certain limited
   parts of our own terrestrial sphere within an alien and normally
   inaccessible aspect or direction of space. It was a curiously
   fragmentary, intangible, and heterogeneous world--a series of
   apparently dissociated scenes merging indistinctly one into the other;
   their constituent details having an obviously different status from
   that of an object drawn into the ancient mirror as Robert had been
   drawn. These scenes were like dream-vistas or magic-lantern
   images--elusive visual impressions of which the boy was not really a
   part, but which formed a sort of panoramic background or ethereal
   environment against which or amidst which he moved.

   He could not touch any of the parts of these scenes--walls, trees,
   furniture, and the like--but whether this was because they were truly
   non-material, or because they always receded at his approach, he was
   singularly unable to determine. Everything seemed fluid, mutable, and
   unreal. When he walked, it appeared to be on whatever lower surface the
   visible scene might have--floor, path, greensward, or such; but upon
   analysis he always found that the contact was an illusion. There was
   never any difference in the resisting force met by his feet--and by his
   hands when he would stoop experimentally--no matter what changes of
   apparent surface might be involved. He could not describe this
   foundation or limiting plane on which he walked as anything more
   definite than a virtually abstract pressure balancing his gravity. Of
   definite tactile distinctiveness it had none, and supplementing it
   there seemed to be a kind of restricted levitational force which
   accomplished transfers of altitude. He could never actually climb
   stairs, yet would gradually walk up from a lower level to a higher.

   Passage from one definite scene to another involved a sort of gliding
   through a region of shadow or blurred focus where the details of each
   scene mingled curiously. All the vistas were distinguished by the
   absence of transient objects, and the indefinite or ambiguous
   appearance of such semi-transient objects as furniture or details of
   vegetation. The lighting of every scene was diffuse and perplexing, and
   of course the scheme of reversed colors--bright red grass, yellow sky
   with confused black and gray cloud-forms, white tree-trunks, and green
   brick walls--gave to everything an air of unbelievable grotesquerie.
   There was an alteration of day and night, which turned out to be a
   reversal of the normal hours of light and darkness at whatever point on
   the earth the mirror might be hanging.

   This seemingly irrelevant diversity of the scenes puzzled Robert until
   he realized that they comprised merely such places as had been
   reflected for long continuous periods in the ancient glass. This also
   explained the odd absence of transient objects, the generally arbitrary
   boundaries of vision, and the fact that all exteriors were framed by
   the outlines of doorways or windows. The glass, it appeared, had power
   to store up these intangible scenes through long exposure; though it
   could never absorb anything corporeally, as Robert had been absorbed,
   except by a very different and particular process.

   But--to me at least--the most incredible aspect of the mad phenomenon
   was the monstrous subversion of our known laws of space involved in the
   relation of various illusory scenes to the actual terrestrial regions
   represented. I have spoken of the glass as storing up the images of
   these regions, but this is really an inexact definition. In truth, each
   of the mirror scenes formed a true and quasi-permanent
   fourth-dimensional projection of the corresponding mundane region; so
   that whenever Robert moved to a certain part of a certain scene, as he
   moved into the image of my room when sending his telepathic messages,
   he was actually in that place itself, on earth--though under spatial
   conditions which cut off all sensory communication, in either
   direction, between him and the present tri-dimensional aspect of the
   place.

   Theoretically speaking, a prisoner in the glass could in a few moments
   go anywhere on our planet--into any place, that is, which had ever been
   reflected in the mirror's surface. This probably applied even to places
   where the mirror had not hung long enough to produce a clear illusory
   scene; the terrestrial region being then represented by a zone of more
   or less formless shadow. Outside the definite scenes was a seemingly
   limitless waste of neutral gray shadow about which Robert could never
   be certain, and into which he never dared stray far lest he become
   hopelessly lost to the real and mirror worlds alike.

   Among the earliest particulars which Robert gave, was the fact that he
   was not alone in his confinement. Various others, all in antique garb,
   were in there with him--a corpulent middle-aged gentleman with tied
   queue and velvet knee-breeches who spoke English fluently though with a
   marked Scandinavian accent; a rather beautiful small girl with very
   blonde hair which appeared a glossy dark blue; two apparently mute
   Negroes whose features contrasted grotesquely with the pallor of their
   reversed-colored skins; three young men; one young woman; a very small
   child, almost an infant; and a lean, elderly Dane of extremely
   distinctive aspect and a kind of half-malign intellectuality of
   countenance.

   This last-named individual--Axel Holm, who wore the satin
   small-clothes, flared-skirted coat, and voluminous full-bottomed
   periwig of an age more than two centuries in the past--was notable
   among the little band as being the one responsible for the presence of
   them all. He it was who, skilled equally in the arts of magic and glass
   working, had long ago fashioned this strange dimensional prison in
   which himself, his slaves, and those whom he chose to invite or allure
   thither were immured unchangingly for as long as the mirror might
   endure. Holm was born early in the seventeenth century, and had
   followed with tremendous competence and success the trade of a
   glass-blower and molder in Copenhagen. His glass, especially in the
   form of large drawing-room mirrors, was always at a premium. But the
   same bold mind which had made him the first glazier of Europe also
   served to carry his interests and ambitions far beyond the sphere of
   mere material craftsmanship. He had studied the world around him, and
   chafed at the limitations of human knowledge and capability. Eventually
   he sought for dark ways to overcome those limitations, and gained more
   success than is good for any mortal.

   He had aspired to enjoy something like eternity, the mirror being his
   provision to secure this end. Serious study of the fourth dimension was
   far from beginning with Einstein in our own era; and Holm, more than
   erudite in all the methods of his day, knew that a bodily entrance into
   that hidden phase of space would prevent him from dying in the ordinary
   physical sense. Research showed him that the principle of reflection
   undoubtedly forms the chief gate to all dimensions beyond our familiar
   three; and chance placed in his hands a small and very ancient glass
   whose cryptic properties he believed he could turn to advantage. Once
   "inside" this mirror according to the method he had envisaged, he felt
   that "life" in the sense of form and consciousness would go on
   virtually forever, provided the mirror could be preserved indefinitely
   from breakage or deterioration.

   Holm made a magnificent mirror, such as would be prized and carefully
   preserved; and in it deftly fused the strange whorl-configured relic he
   had acquired. Having thus prepared his refuge and his trap, he began to
   plan his mode of entrance and conditions of tenancy. He would have with
   him both servitors and companions; and as an experimental beginning he
   sent before him into the glass two dependable Negro slaves brought from
   the West Indies. What his sensations must have been upon beholding this
   first concrete demonstration of his theories, only imagination can
   conceive.

   Undoubtedly a man of his knowledge realized that absence from the
   outside world, if deferred beyond the natural span of life of those
   within, must mean instant dissolution at the first attempt to return to
   that world. But, barring that misfortune or accidental breakage, those
   within would remain forever as they were at the time of entrance. They
   would never grow old, and would need neither food nor drink. To make
   his prison tolerable he sent ahead of him certain books and writing
   materials, a chair and table of stoutest workmanship, and a few other
   accessories. He knew that the images which the glass would reflect or
   absorb would not be tangible, but would merely extend around him like a
   background of dream. His own transition in 1687 was a momentous
   experience; and must have been attended by mixed sensations of triumph
   and terror. Had anything gone wrong, there were frightful possibilities
   of being lost in dark and inconceivable multiple dimensions.

   For over fifty years he had been unable to secure any additions to the
   little company of himself and slaves, but later on he had perfected his
   telepathic method of visualizing small sections of the outside world
   close to the glass, and attracting certain individuals in those areas
   through the mirror's strange entrance. Thus Robert, influenced into a
   desire to press upon the "door," had been lured within. Such
   visualizations depended wholly on telepathy, since no one inside the
   mirror could see out into the world of men. It was, in truth, a strange
   life that Holm and his company had lived inside the glass. Since the
   mirror had stood for fully a century with its face to the dusty stone
   wall of the shed where I found it, Robert was the first being to enter
   this limbo after all that interval. His arrival was a gala event, for
   he brought news of the outside world which must have been of the most
   startling impressiveness to the more thoughtful of those within. He, in
   his turn--young though he was--felt overwhelmingly the weirdness of
   meeting and talking with persons who had been alive in the seventeenth
   and eighteenth centuries.

   The deadly monotony of life for the prisoners can only be vaguely
   conjectured. As mentioned, its extensive spatial variety was limited to
   localities which had been reflected in the mirror for long periods; and
   many of these had become dim and strange as tropical climates had made
   inroads on the surface. Certain localities were bright and beautiful,
   and in these the company usually gathered. But no scene could be fully
   satisfying; since the visible objects were all unreal and intangible,
   and often of perplexingly indefinite outline. When the tedious periods
   of darkness came, the general custom was to indulge in memories,
   reflections, or conversations. Each one of that strange, pathetic group
   had retained his or her personality unchanged and unchangeable, since
   becoming immune to the time effects of outside space. The number of
   inanimate objects within the glass, aside from the clothing of the
   prisoners, was very small; being largely limited to the accessories
   Holm had provided for himself. The rest did without even furniture,
   since sleep and fatigue had vanished along with most other vital
   attributes. Such inorganic things as were present, seemed as exempt
   from decay as the living beings. The lower forms of animal life were
   wholly absent.

   Robert derived most of his information from Herr Thiele, the gentleman
   who spoke English with a Scandinavian accent. This portly Dane had
   taken a fancy to him, and talked at considerable length. The others,
   too, had received him with courtesy and goodwill; Holm himself, seeming
   well-disposed, had told him about various matters including the door of
   the trap.

   The boy, as he told me later, was sensible enough never to attempt
   communication with me when Holm was nearby. Twice, while thus engaged,
   he had seen Holm appear; and had accordingly ceased at once. At no time
   could I see the world behind the mirror's surface. Robert's visual
   image, which included his bodily form and the clothing connected with
   it, was--like the aural image of his halting voice and like his own
   visualization of myself--a case of purely telepathic transmission; and
   did not involve true interdimensional sight. However, had Robert been
   as trained a telepathist as Holm, he might have transmitted a few
   strong images apart from his immediate person. Throughout this period
   of revelation I had, of course, been desperately trying to devise a
   method for Robert's release. On the fourth day--the ninth after the
   disappearance--I hit on a solution. Everything considered, my
   laboriously formulated process was not a very complicated one; though I
   could not tell beforehand how it would work, while the possibility of
   ruinous consequences in case of a slip was appalling. This process
   depended, basically, on the fact that there was no possible exit from
   inside the glass. If Holm and his prisoners were permanently sealed in,
   then release must come wholly from outside. Other considerations
   included the disposal of the other prisoners, if any survived, and
   especially of Axel Holm. What Robert had told me of him was anything
   but reassuring; and I certainly did not wish him loose in my apartment,
   free once more to work his evil will upon the world. The telepathic
   messages had not made fully clear the effect of liberation on those who
   had entered the glass so long ago.

   There was, too, a final though minor problem in case of success--that
   of getting Robert back into the routine of school life without having
   to explain the incredible. In case of failure, it was highly
   inadvisable to have witnesses present at the release operations--and
   lacking these, I simply could not attempt to relate the actual facts if
   I should succeed. Even to me the reality seemed a mad one whenever I
   let my mind turn from the data so compellingly presented in that tense
   series of dreams.

   When I had thought these problems through as far as possible, I
   procured a large magnifying-glass from the school laboratory and
   studied minutely every square millimeter of that whorl-center which
   presumably marked the extent of the original ancient mirror used by
   Holm. Even with this aid I could not quite trace the exact boundary
   between the old area and the surface added by the Danish wizard: but
   after a long study decided on a conjectural oval boundary which I
   outlined very precisely with a soft blue pencil. I then made a trip to
   Stamford, where I procured a heavy glass-cutting tool; for my primary
   idea was to remove the ancient and magically potent mirror from its
   later setting.

   My next step was to figure out the best time of day to make the crucial
   experiment. I finally settled on two-thirty a.m.--both because it was a
   good season for uninterrupted work, and because it was the "opposite"
   of two-thirty p.m., the probable moment at which Robert had entered the
   mirror. This form of "oppositeness" may or may not have been relevant,
   but I knew at least that the chosen hour was as good as any--and
   perhaps better than most.

   I finally set to work in the early morning of the eleventh day after
   the disappearance, having drawn all the shades of my living-room and
   closed and locked the door into the hallway. Following with breathless
   care the elliptical line I had traced, I worked around the
   whorl-section with my steel-wheeled cutting tool. The ancient glass,
   half an inch thick, crackled crisply under the firm, uniform pressure;
   and upon completing the circuit I cut around it a second time,
   crunching the roller more deeply into the glass.

   Then, very carefully indeed, I lifted the heavy mirror down from its
   console and leaned it face-inward against the wall; prying off two of
   the thin, narrow boards nailed to the back. With equal caution I
   smartly tapped the cut-around space with the heavy wooden handle of the
   glass-cutter.

   At the very first tap the whorl-containing section of glass dropped out
   on the Bokhara rug beneath. I did not know what might happen, but was
   keyed up for anything, and took a deep involuntary breath. I was on my
   knees for convenience at the moment, with my face quite near the newly
   made aperture; and as I breathed there poured into my nostrils a
   powerful dusty odor--a smell not comparable to any other I have ever
   encountered. Then everything within my range of vision suddenly turned
   to a dull gray before my failing eyesight as I felt myself overpowered
   by an invisible force which robbed my muscles of their power to
   function.

   I remember grasping weakly and futilely at the edge of the nearest
   window drapery and feeling it rip loose from its fastening. Then I sank
   slowly to the floor as the darkness of oblivion passed over me.

   When I regained consciousness I was lying on the Bokhara rug with my
   legs held unaccountably up in the air. The room was full of that
   hideous and inexplicable dusty smell--and as my eyes began to take in
   definite images I saw that Robert Grandison stood in front of me. It
   was he--fully in the flesh and with his coloring normal--who was
   holding my legs aloft to bring the blood back to my head as the
   school's first-aid course had taught him to do with persons who had
   fainted. For a moment I was struck mute by the stifling odor and by a
   bewilderment which quickly merged into a sense of triumph. Then I found
   myself able to move and speak collectedly.

   I raised a tentative hand and waved feebly at Robert.

   "All right, old man," I murmured, "you can let my legs down now. Many
   thanks. I'm all right again, I think. It was the smell--I imagine--that
   got me. Open that farthest window, please--wide--from the bottom.
   That's it--thanks. No--leave the shade down the way it was." I
   struggled to my feet, my disturbed circulation adjusting itself in
   waves, and stood upright hanging to the back of a big chair. I was
   still "groggy," but a blast of fresh, bitterly cold air from the window
   revived me rapidly. I sat down in the big chair and looked at Robert,
   now walking toward me.

   "First," I said hurriedly, "tell me, Robert--those others--Holm? What
   happened to them, when I--opened the exit?"

   Robert paused half-way across the room and looked at me very gravely.

   "I saw them fade away--into nothingness--Mr. Canevin," he said with
   solemnity; "and with them--everything. There isn't any more `inside,'
   sir--thank God, and you, sir!"

   And young Robert, at last yielding to the sustained strain which he had
   borne through all those terrible eleven days, suddenly broke down like
   a little child and began to weep hysterically in great, stifling, dry
   sobs.

   I picked him up and placed him gently on my davenport, threw a rug over
   him, sat down by his side, and put a calming hand on his forehead.
   "Take it easy, old fellow," I said soothingly.

   The boy's sudden and very natural hysteria passed as quickly as it had
   come on as I talked to him reassuringly about my plans for his quiet
   restoration to the school. The interest of the situation and the need
   of concealing the incredible truth beneath a rational explanation took
   hold of his imagination as I had expected; and at last he sat up
   eagerly, telling the details of his release and listening to the
   instructions I had thought out. He had, it seems, been in the
   "projected area" of my bedroom when I opened the way back, and had
   emerged in that actual room--hardly realizing that he was "out." Upon
   hearing a fall in the living-room he had hastened thither, finding me
   on the rug in my fainting spell.

   I need mention only briefly my method of restoring Robert in a
   seemingly normal way--how I smuggled him out of the window in an old
   hat and sweater of mine, took him down the road in my quietly started
   car, coached him carefully in a tale I had devised, and returned to
   arouse Browne with the news of his discovery. He had, I explained, been
   walking alone on the afternoon of his disappearance; and had been
   offered a motor ride by two young men who, as a joke and over his
   protests that he could go no farther than Stamford and back, had begun
   to carry him past that town. Jumping from the car during a traffic stop
   with the intention of hitch-hiking back before Call-Over, he had been
   hit by another car just as the traffic was released--awakening ten days
   later in the Greenwich home of the people who had hit him. On learning
   the date, I added, he had immediately telephoned the school; and I,
   being the only one awake, had answered the call and hurried after him
   in my car without stopping to notify anyone.

   Browne, who at once telephoned to Robert's parents, accepted my story
   without question; and forbore to interrogate the boy because of the
   latter's manifest exhaustion. It was arranged that he should remain at
   the school for a rest, under the expert care of Mrs. Browne, a former
   trained nurse. I naturally saw a good deal of him during the remainder
   of the Christmas vacation, and was thus enabled to fill in certain gaps
   in his fragmentary dream-story.

   Now and then we would almost doubt the actuality of what had occurred;
   wondering whether we had not both shared some monstrous delusion born
   of the mirror's glittering hypnotism, and whether the tale of the ride
   and accident were not after all the real truth. But whenever we did so
   we would be brought back to belief by some monstrous and haunting
   memory; with me, of Robert's dream-figure and its thick voice and
   inverted colors; with him, of the whole fantastic pageantry of ancient
   people and dead scenes that he had witnessed. And then there was that
   joint recollection of that damnable dusty odor. . . . We knew what it
   meant: the instant dissolution of those who had entered an alien
   dimension a century and more ago.

   There are, in addition, at least two lines of rather more positive
   evidence; one of which comes through my researches in Danish annals
   concerning the sorcerer, Axel Holm. Such a person, indeed, left many
   traces in folklore and written records; and diligent library sessions,
   plus conferences with various learned Danes, have shed much more light
   on his evil fame. At present I need say only that the Copenhagen
   glass-blower--born in 1612--was a notorious Luciferian whose pursuits
   and final vanishing formed a matter of awed debate over two centuries
   ago. He had burned with a desire to know all things and to conquer
   every limitation of mankind--to which end he had delved deeply into
   occult and forbidden fields ever since he was a child.

   He was commonly held to have joined a coven of the dreaded witch-cult,
   and the vast lore of ancient Scandinavian myth--with its Loki the Sly
   One and the accursed Fenris-Wolf--was soon an open book to him. He had
   strange interests and objectives, few of which were definitely known,
   but some of which were recognized as intolerably evil. It is recorded
   that his two Negro helpers, originally slaves from the Danish West
   Indies, had become mute soon after their acquisition by him; and that
   they had disappeared not long before his own disappearance from the ken
   of mankind.

   Near the close of an already long life the idea of a glass of
   immortality appears to have entered his mind. That he had acquired an
   enchanted mirror of inconceivable antiquity was a matter of common
   whispering; it being alleged that he had purloined it from a
   fellow-sorcerer who had entrusted it to him for polishing.

   This mirror--according to popular tales a trophy as potent in its way
   as the better-known Aegis of Minerva or Hammer of Thor--was a small
   oval object called "Loki's Glass," made of some polished fusible
   mineral and having magical properties which included the divination of
   the immediate future and the power to show the possessor his enemies.
   That it had deeper potential properties, realizable in the hands of an
   erudite magician, none of the common people doubted; and even educated
   persons attached much fearful importance to Holm's rumored attempts to
   incorporate it in a larger glass of immortality. Then had come the
   wizard's disappearance in 1687, and the final sale and dispersal of his
   goods amidst a growing cloud of fantastic legendry. It was, altogether,
   just such a story as one would laugh at if possessed of no particular
   key; yet to me, remembering those dream messages and having Robert
   Grandison's corroboration before me, it formed a positive confirmation
   of all the bewildering marvels that had been unfolded.

   But as I have said, there is still another line of rather positive
   evidence--of a very different character--at my disposal. Two days after
   his release, as Robert, greatly improved in strength and appearance,
   was placing a log on my living-room fire, I noticed a certain
   awkwardness in his motions and was struck by a persistent idea.
   Summoning him to my desk I suddenly asked him to pick up an
   ink-stand--and was scarcely surprised to note that, despite lifelong
   right-handedness, he obeyed unconsciously with his left hand. Without
   alarming him, I then asked that he unbutton his coat and let me listen
   to his cardiac action. What I found upon placing my ear to his
   chest--and what I did not tell him for some time afterward--was that
   his heart was beating on his right side.

   He had gone into the glass right-handed and with all organs in their
   normal positions. Now he was left-handed and with organs reversed, and
   would doubtless continue so for the rest of his life. Clearly, the
   dimensional transition had been no illusion--for this physical change
   was tangible and unmistakable. Had there been a natural exit from the
   glass, Robert would probably have undergone a thorough re-reversal and
   emerged in perfect normality--as indeed the color-scheme of his body
   and clothing did emerge. The forcible nature of his release, however,
   undoubtedly set something awry; so that dimensions no longer had a
   chance to right themselves as chromatic wave-frequencies still did.

   I had not merely opened Holm's trap; I had destroyed it; and at the
   particular stage of destruction marked by Robert's escape some of the
   reversing properties had perished. It is significant that in escaping
   Robert had felt no pain comparable to that experienced in entering. Had
   the destruction been still more sudden, I shiver to think of the
   monstrosities of color the boy would always have been forced to bear. I
   may add that after discovering Robert's reversal I examined the rumpled
   and discarded clothing he had worn in the glass, and found, as I had
   expected, a complete reversal of pockets, buttons, and all other
   corresponding details.

   At this moment Loki's Glass, just as it fell on my Bokhara rug from the
   now patched and harmless mirror, weighs down a sheaf of papers on my
   writing-table here in St. Thomas, venerable capital of the Danish West
   Indies--now the American Virgin Islands. Various collectors of old
   Sandwich glass have mistaken it for an odd bit of that early American
   product--but I privately realize that my paper-weight is an antique of
   far subtler and more paleogean craftsmanship. Still, I do not
   disillusion such enthusiasts.

   8529The TreeH. P. Lovecraft

   On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive
   grove about the ruins of a villa. Close by is a tomb, once beautiful
   with the sublimest sculptures, but now fallen into as great decay as
   the house. At one end of that tomb, its curious roots displacing the
   time-stained blocks of Pentelic marble, grows an unnaturally large
   olive tree of oddly repellent shape; so like to some grotesque man, or
   death-distorted body of a man, that the country folk fear to pass it at
   night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs. Mount
   Maenalus is a chosen haunt of dreaded Pan, whose queer companions are
   many, and simple swains believe that the tree must have some hideous
   kinship to these weird Panisci; but an old bee-keeper who lives in the
   neighboring cottage told me a different story.

   Many years ago, when the hillside villa was new and resplendent, there
   dwelt within it the two sculptors Kalos and Musides. From Lydia to
   Neapolis the beauty of their work was praised, and none dared say that
   the one excelled the other in skill. The Hermes of Kalos stood in a
   marble shrine in Corinth, and the Pallas of Musides surmounted a pillar
   in Athens near the Parthenon. All men paid homage to Kalos and Musides,
   and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of
   their brotherly friendship.

   But though Kalos and Musides dwelt in unbroken harmony, their natures
   were not alike. Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban
   gaieties of Tegea, Kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the
   sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove. There he
   would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind, and there devise
   the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble.
   Idle folk, indeed, said that Kalos conversed with the spirits of the
   grove, and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he
   met there for he patterned his work after no living model.

   So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of
   Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche
   which he had planned for his city. Of great size and cunning
   workmanship must the statue be, for it was to form a wonder of nations
   and a goal of travellers. Exalted beyond thought would be he whose work
   should gain acceptance, and for this honor Kalos and Musides were
   invited to compete. Their brotherly love was well known, and the crafty
   Tyrant surmised that each, instead of concealing his work from the
   other, would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of
   unheard of beauty, the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams
   of poets.

   With joy the sculptors hailed the Tyrant's offer, so that in the days
   that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels. Not
   from each other did Kalos and Musides conceal their work, but the sight
   was for them alone. Saving theirs, no eyes beheld the two divine
   figures released by skillful blows from the rough blocks that had
   imprisoned them since the world began.

   At night, as of yore, Musides sought the banquet halls of Tegea whilst
   Kalos wandered alone in the olive Grove. But as time passed, men
   observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling Musides. It was
   strange, they said amongst themselves that depression should thus seize
   one with so great a chance to win art's loftiest reward. Many months
   passed yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp
   expectancy which the situation should arouse.

   Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none
   marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was
   known to be deep and sacred. Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and
   indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy
   serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides
   who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the
   slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own
   hands. Hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of
   Tyche, little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful
   attendant.

   As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations
   of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be
   carried often to the grove which he so loved. There he would ask to be
   left alone, as if wishing to speak with unseen things. Musides ever
   granted his requests, though his eyes filled with visible tears at the
   thought that Kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than
   for him. At last the end drew near, and Kalos discoursed of things
   beyond this life. Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more
   lovely than the tomb of Mausolus; but Kalos bade him speak no more of
   marble glories. Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man;
   that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his
   resting place-close to his head. And one night, sitting alone in the
   darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died. Beautiful beyond words was the
   marble sepulchre which stricken Musides carved for his beloved friend.
   None but Kalos himself could have fashioned such basreliefs, wherein
   were displayed all the splendours of Elysium. Nor did Musides fail to
   bury close to Kalos' head the olive twigs from the grove.

   As the first violence of Musides' grief gave place to resignation, he
   labored with diligence upon his figure of Tyche. All honour was now
   his, since the Tyrant of Syracuse would have the work of none save him
   or Kalos. His task proved a vent for his emotion and he toiled more
   steadily each day, shunning the gaieties he once had relished.
   Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend, where
   a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper's head. So swift was
   the growth of this tree, and so strange was its form, that all who
   beheld it exclaimed in surprise; and Musides seemed at once fascinated
   and repelled.

   Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to
   the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty
   statue was finished. By this time the tree by the tomb had attained
   amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending
   out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides
   labored. As many visitors came to view the prodigious tree, as to
   admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was seldom alone. But
   he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to dread
   being alone now that his absorbing work was done. The bleak mountain
   wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb-tree, had an uncanny
   way of forming vaguely articulate sounds.

   The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to
   Tegea. It was definitely known that they had come to bear away the
   great image of Tyche and bring eternal honour to Musides, so their
   reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth. As the night wore on a
   violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men
   from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town. They
   talked of their illustrious Tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital
   and exulted in the glory of the statue which Musides had wrought for
   him. And then the men of Tegea spoke of the goodness of Musides, and of
   his heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of
   art could console him in the absence of Kalos, who might have worn
   those laurels instead. Of the tree which grew by the tomb, near the
   head of Kalos, they also spoke. The wind shrieked more horribly, and
   both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos.

   In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant's messengers
   up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done
   strange things. Slaves' cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and
   no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that
   vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled. Lone and shaken
   mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous
   greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of
   the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd
   completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood
   aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose
   aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the
   sculptured sepulchre of Kalos. And their fear and dismay increased when
   they searched the fallen apartment, for of the gentle Musides, and of
   the marvellously fashioned image of Tyche, no trace could be
   discovered. Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the
   representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they
   had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown.
   However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue
   in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora
   a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety
   of Musides.

   But the olive grove still stands, as does the tree growing out of the
   tomb of Kalos, and the old bee-keeper told me that sometimes the boughs
   whisper to one another in the night wind, saying over and over again.
   "Oida! Oida! -I know! I know!"

I.[edit]

   Southeast of Hampden, near the tortuous Salmon River gorge, is a range
   of steep, rocky hills which have defied all efforts of sturdy
   homesteaders. The canyons are too deep and the slopes too precipitous
   to encourage anything save seasonal livestock grazing. The last time I
   visited Hampden the region--known as Hell's Acres--was part of the Blue
   Mountain Forest Reserve. There are no roads linking this inaccessible
   locality with the outside world, and the hillfolk will tell you that it
   is indeed a spot transplanted from his Satanic Majesty's front yard.
   There is a local superstition that the area is haunted--but by what or
   by whom no one seems to know. Natives will not venture within its
   mysterious depths, for they believe the stories handed down to them by
   the Nez Perce Indians, who have shunned the region for untold
   generations, because, according to them, it is a playground of certain
   giant devils from the Outside. These suggestive tales made me very
   curious.

   My first excursion--and my last, thank God!--into those hills occurred
   while Constantine Theunis and I were living in Hampden the summer of
   1938. He was writing a treatise on Egyptian mythology, and I found
   myself alone much of the time, despite the fact that we shared a modest
   cabin on Beacon Street, within sight of the infamous Pirate House,
   built by Exer Jones over sixty years ago.

   The morning of June 23rd found me walking in those oddly shaped hills,
   which had, since seven o'clock, seemed very ordinary indeed. I must
   have been about seven miles north of Hampden before I noticed anything
   unusual. I was climbing a grassy ridge overlooking a particularly deep
   canyon, when I cam upon an area totally devoid of the usual bunch-grass
   and greaseweed. It extended southward, over numerous hills and valleys.
   At first I thought the spot had been burned over the previous fall, but
   upon examining the turf, I found no signs of a blaze. The nearby slopes
   and ravines looked terribly scarred and seared, as if some gigantic
   torch had blasted them, wiping away all vegetation. And yet there was
   no evidence of fire...

   I moved on over rich, black soil in which no grass flourished. As I
   headed for the approximate center of this desolate area, I began to
   notice a strange silence. There were no larks, no rabbits, and even the
   insects seemed to have deserted the place. I gained the summit of a
   lofty knoll and tried to guess at the size of that bleak, inexplicable
   region. Then I saw the lone tree.

   It stood on a hill somewhat higher than its companions, and attracted
   the eye because it was so utterly unexpected. I had seen no trees for
   miles: thorn and hackberry bushes clustered the shallower ravines, but
   there had been no mature trees. Strange to find one standing on the
   crest of the hill.

   I crossed two steep canyons before I came to it; and a surprise awaited
   me. It was not a pine tree, nor a fir tree, nor a hackberry tree. I had
   never, in all my life, seen one to compare with it--and I never have to
   this day, for which I am eternally thankful!

   More than anything it resembled an oak. It had a huge, twisted trunk,
   fully a yard in diameter, and the large limbs began spreading outward
   scarcely seven feet from the ground. The leaves were round, and
   curiously alike in size and design. It might have been a tree painted
   on a canvas, but I will swear that it was real. I shall always know
   that it was real, despite what Theunis said later.

   I recall that I glanced at the sun and judged the time to be about ten
   o'clock a.m., although I did not look at my watch. The day was becoming
   warm, and I sat for a while in the welcome shade of the huge tree. Then
   I regarded the rank grass that flourished beneath it--another singular
   phenomenon when I remembered the bleak terrain through which I had
   passed. A wild maze of hills, ravines, and bluffs hemmed me in on all
   sides, although the rise on which I sat was rather higher than any
   other within miles. I looked far to the east--and I jumped to my feet,
   startled and amazed. Shimmering though a blue haze of distance were the
   Bitterroot Mountains! There is no other range of snow-capped peaks
   within three hundred miles of Hampden; and I knew--at this
   altitude--that I shouldn't be seeing them at all. For several minutes I
   gazed at the marvel; then I became drowsy. I lay in the rank grass,
   beneath the tree. I unstrapped my camera, took off my hat, and relaxed,
   staring skyward through the green leaves. I closed my eyes.

   Then a curious phenomenon began to assail me--a vague, cloudy sort of
   vision--glimpsing or day-dreaming seemingly without relevance to
   anything familiar. I thought I saw a great temple by a sea of ooze,
   where three suns gleamed in a pale red sky. The vast tomb, or temple,
   was an anomalous color--a nameless blue-violet shade. Large beasts flew
   in the cloudy sky, and I seemed to hear the pounding of their scaly
   wings. I went nearer the stone temple, and a huge doorway loomed in
   front of me. Within that portal were swirling shadows that seemed to
   dart and leer and try to snatch me inside that awful darkness. I
   thought I saw three flaming eyes in the shifting void of a doorway, and
   I screamed with mortal fear. In that noisome depth, I knew, lurked
   utter destruction--a living hell even worse than death. I screamed
   again. The vision faded.

   I saw the round leaves and the sane earthly sky. I struggled to rise. I
   was trembling; cold perspiration beaded my brow. I had a mad impulse to
   flee; run insanely from that sinister tree on the hill--but I checked
   the absurd intuition and sat down, trying to collect my senses. Never
   had I dreamed anything so realistic; so horrifying. What had caused the
   vision? I had been reading several of Theunis' tomes on ancient
   Egypt...I mopped my forehead, and decided that it was time for lunch.
   But I did not feel like eating.

   Then I had an inspiration. I would take a few snapshots of the tree,
   for Theunis. They might shock him out of his habitual air of unconcern.
   Perhaps I would tell him about the dream...Opening my camera, I took
   half a dozen shots of the tree. Also, I included one of the gleaming,
   snow-crested peaks. I might want to return, and these photos would
   help...

   Folding the camera, I returned to my cushion of soft grass. Had that
   spot beneath the tree a certain alien enchantment? I know that I was
   reluctant to leave it...

   I gazed upward at the curious round leaves. I closed my eyes. A breeze
   stirred the branches, and their whispered music lulled me into tranquil
   oblivion. And suddenly I saw again the pale red sky and the three suns.
   The land of three shadows! Again the great temple came into view. I
   seemed to be floating on the air--a disembodied spirit exploring the
   wonders of a mad, multi-dimensional world! The temple's oddly angled
   cornices frightened me, and I knew that this place was one that no man
   on earth had ever seen in his wildest dreams.

   Again the vast doorway yawned before me; and I was sucked within that
   black, writing cloud. I seemed to be staring at space unlimited. I saw
   a void beyond my vocabulary to describe; a dark, bottomless gulf
   teeming with nameless shapes and entities--things of madness and
   delirium, as tenuous as a mist from Shamballah.

   My soul shrank. I was terribly afraid. I screamed and screamed, and
   felt that I would soon go mad. Then in my dream I ran and ran in a
   fever of utter terror, but I did not know what I was running from...I
   left that hideous temple and that hellish void, yet I knew I must,
   barring some miracle, return...

   At last my eyes flew open. I was not beneath the tree. I was sprawled
   on a rocky slope, my clothing torn and disordered. My hands were
   bleeding. I stood up, pain stabbing through me. I recognized the
   spot--the ridge where I had first seen the blasted area! I must have
   walked miles--unconscious! The tree was not in sight, and I was
   glad...Even the knees of my trousers were torn, as if I had crawled
   part of the way...

   I glanced at the sun. Late afternoon! Where had I been? I snatched out
   my watch. It had stopped at 10:34...

II.[edit]

   "So you have the snapshots?" Theunis drawled. I met his gray eyes
   across the breakfast table. Three days had slipped by since my return
   from Hell's Acres. I had told him about the dream beneath the tree, and
   he had laughed.

   "Yes," I replied. "They came last night. Haven't had a chance to open
   them yet. Give 'em a good, careful study--if they aren't all failures.
   Perhaps you'll change your mind."

   Theunis smiled; sipped his coffee. I gave him the unopened envelope and
   he quickly broke the seal and withdrew the pictures. He glanced at the
   first one, and the smile faded from his leonine face. He crushed out
   his cigarette.

   "My God, man! Look at this!"

   I seized the glossy rectangle. It was the first picture of the tree,
   taken at a distance of fifty feet or so. The cause of Theunis'
   excitement escaped me. There it was, standing boldly on the hill, while
   below it grew the jungle of grass where I had lain. In the distance
   were my snow-capped mountains!

   "There you are," I cried. "The proof of my story--"

   "Look at it!" Theunis snapped. "The shadows--there are three for every
   rock, bush, and tree!"

   He was right...below the tree, spread in fanlike incongruity, lay three
   overlapping shadows. Suddenly I realized that the picture held an
   abnormal and inconsistent element. The leaves on the thing were too
   lush for the work of sane nature, while the trunk was bulged and
   knotted in the most abhorrent shapes. Theunis dropped the picture on
   the table.

   "There is something wrong," I muttered. "The tree I saw didn't look as
   repulsive as that--"

   "Are you sure?" Theunis grated. "The fact is, you may have seen many
   things not recorded on this film."

   "It shows more than I saw!"

   "That's the point. There is something damnably out of place in this
   landscape; something I can't understand. The tree seems to suggest a
   thought--beyond my grasp...It is too misty; too uncertain; too unreal
   to be natural!" He rapped nervous fingers on the table. He snatched the
   remaining films and shuffled through them, rapidly.

   I reached for the snapshot he had dropped, and sensed a touch of
   bizarre uncertainty and strangeness as my eyes absorbed its every
   detail. The flowers and weeds pointed at varying angles, while some of
   the grass grew in the most bewildering fashion. The tree seemed too
   veiled and clouded to be readily distinguished, but I noted the huge
   limbs and the half-bent flower stems that were ready to fall over, yet
   did not fall. And the many, overlapping shadows...They were,
   altogether, very disquieting shadows--too long or short when compared
   to the stems they fell below to give one a feeling of comfortable
   normality. The landscape hadn't shocked me the day of my visit...There
   was a dark familiarity and mocking suggestion of it; something
   tangible, yet distant as the stars beyond the galaxy.

   Theunis came back to earth. "Did you mention three suns in your
   dreaming orgy?"

   I nodded, frankly puzzled. Then it dawned on me. My fingers trembled
   slightly as I stared at the picture again. My dream! Of course--

   "The others are just like it," Theunis said. "That same uncertainness;
   that suggestion. I should be able to catch the mood of the thing; see
   it in its real light, but it is too...Perhaps later I shall find out,
   if I look at it long enough.

   We sat in silence for some time. A thought came to me, suddenly,
   prompted by a strange, inexplicable longing to visit the tree again.
   "Let's make an excursion. I think I can take you there in half a day."

   "You'd better stay away," replied Theunis, thoughtfully. "I doubt if
   you could find the place again if you wanted to."

   "Nonsense," I replied. "Surely, with these photos to guide us--"

   "Do you see any familiar landmarks in them?"

   His observation was uncanny. After looking through the remaining snaps
   carefully, I had to admit that there were none.

   Theunis muttered under his breath and drew viciously on his cigarette.
   "A perfectly normal--or nearly so--picture of a spot apparently dropped
   from nowhere. Seeing mountains at this low altitude is
   preposterous...but wait!"

   He sprang from the chair as a hunted animal and raced from the room. I
   could hear him moving about in our makeshift library, cursing volubly.
   Before long he reappeared with an old, leather-bound volume. Theunis
   opened it reverently, and peered over the odd characters.

   "What do you call that?" I inquired.

   "This is an early English translation of the Chronicle of Nath, written
   by Rudolf Yergler, a German mystic and alchemist who borrowed some of
   his lore from Hermes Trismegistus, the ancient Egyptian sorcerer. There
   is a passage here that might interest you--might make you understand
   why this business is even further from the natural than you suspect.
   Listen."
"So in the year of the Black Goat there came unto Nath a shadow that should not
be on
Earth, and that had no form known to the eyes of Earth. And it fed on the souls
of men;
they that it gnawed being lured and blinded with dreams till the horror and the
endless
night lay upon them. Nor did they see that which gnawed them; for the shadow too
k false
shapes that men know or dream of, and only freedom seemed waiting in the Land of
 the
Three Suns. But it was told by priests of the Old Book that he who could see the
shadow's true shape, and live after the seeing, might shun its doom and send it
back to
the starless gulf of its spawning. This none could do save through the Gem; wher
efore did
Ka-Nefer the High-Priest keep that gem sacred in the temple. And when it was los
t with
Phrenes, he who braved the horror and was never seen more, there was weeping in
Nath. Yet
did the Shadow depart sated at last, nor shall it hunger again till the cycles r
oll back
to the year of the Black Goat."

   Theunis paused while I stared, bewildered. Finally he spoke. "Now,
   Single, I suppose you can guess how this all links up. There is no need
   of going deep into the primal lore behind this business, but I may as
   well tell you that according to the old legends this is the so-called
   "Year of the Black Goat"--when certain horrors from the fathomless
   Outside are supposed to visit the earth and do infinite harm. We don't
   know how they'll be manifest, but there's reason to think that strange
   mirages and hallucinations will be mixed up in the matter. I don't like
   the thing you've run up against--the story or the pictures. It may be
   pretty bad, and I warn you to look out. But first I must try to do what
   old Yergler says--to see if I can glimpse the matter as it is.
   Fortunately the old Gem he mentions has been rediscovered--I know where
   I can get at it. We must use it on the photograph and see what we see.

   "It's more or less like a lens or prism, though one can't take
   photographs with it. Someone of peculiar sensitiveness might look
   through and sketch what he sees. There's a bit of danger, and the
   looker may have his consciousness shaken a trifle; for the real shape
   of the shadow isn't pleasant and doesn't belong on this earth. But it
   would be a lot more dangerous not to do anything about it. Meanwhile,
   if you value your life and your sanity, keep away from that hill--and
   from the thing you think is a tree on it."

   I was more bewildered than ever. "How can there be organized beings
   from the Outside in our midst?" I cried. "How do we know that such
   things exist?"

   "You reason in terms of this tiny earth," Theunis said. "Surely you
   don't think that the world is a rule for measuring the universe. There
   are entities we never dream of floating under our very noses. Modern
   science is thrusting back the borderland of the unknown and proving
   that the mystics were not so far off the track--"

   Suddenly I knew I did not want to look at the picture again; I wanted
   to destroy it. I wanted to run from it. Theunis was suggesting
   something beyond...A trembling, cosmic fear gripped me and drew me away
   from the hideous picture, for I was afraid I would recognize some
   object in it...

   I glanced at my friend. He was poring over the ancient book, a strange
   expression on his face. He sat up straight. "Let's call the thing off
   for today. I'm tired of this endless guessing and wondering. I must get
   the loan of the gem from the museum where it is, and do what is to be
   done."

   "As you say," I replied. "Will you have to go to Croydon?"

   He nodded.

   "Then we'll both go home," I said decisively.

III.[edit]

   I need not chronicle the events of the fortnight that followed. With me
   they formed a constant and enervating struggle between a mad longing to
   return to the cryptic tree of dreams and freedom, and a frenzied dread
   of that selfsame thing and all connected with it. That I did not return
   is perhaps less a matter of my own will than a matter of pure chance.
   Meanwhile I knew that Theunis was desperately active in some
   investigation of the strangest nature--something which included a
   mysterious motor trip and a return under circumstances of the greatest
   secrecy. By hints over the telephone I was made to understand that he
   had somewhere borrowed the obscure and primal object mentioned in the
   ancient volume as "The Gem," and that he was busy devising a means of
   applying it to the photographs I had left with him. He spoke
   fragmentarily of "refraction," "polarization," and "unknown angles of
   space and time," and indicated that he was building a kind of box or
   camera obscura for the study of the curious snapshots with the gem's
   aid.

   It was on the sixteenth day that I received the startling message from
   the hospital in Croydon. Theunis was there, and wanted to see me at
   once. He had suffered some odd sort of seizure; being found prone and
   unconscious by friends who found their way into his house after hearing
   certain cries of mortal agony and fear. Though still weak and helpless,
   he had now regained his senses and seemed frantic to tell me something
   and have me perform certain important duties. This much the hospital
   informed me over the wire; and within half an hour I was at my friend's
   bedside, marveling at the inroads which worry and tension had made on
   his features in so brief a time. His first act was to move away the
   nurses in order to speak in utter confidence.

   "Single--I saw it!" His voice was strained and husky. "You must destroy
   them all--those pictures. I sent it back by seeing it, but the pictures
   had better go. That tree will never be seen on the hill again--at
   least, I hope not--till thousands of eons bring back the Year of the
   Black Goat. You are safe now--mankind is safe." He paused, breathing
   heavily, and continued.

   "Take the Gem out of the apparatus and put it in the safe--you know the
   combination. It must go back where it came from, for there's a time
   when it may be needed to save the world. They won't let me leave here
   yet, but I can rest if I know it's safe. Don't look through the box as
   it is--it would fix you as it's fixed me. And burn those damned
   photographs...the one in the box and the others..." But Theunis was
   exhausted now, and the nurses advanced and motioned me away as he
   leaned back and closed his eyes.

   In another half-hour I was at his house and looking curiously at the
   long black box on the library table beside the overturned chair.
   Scattered papers blew about in a breeze from the open window, and close
   to the box I recognized with a queer sensation the envelope of pictures
   I had taken. It required only a moment for me to examine the box and
   detach at one end my earliest picture of the tree, and at the other end
   a strange bit of amber-colored crystal, cut in devious angles
   impossible to classify. The touch of the glass fragment seemed
   curiously warm and electric, and I could scarcely bear to put it out of
   sight in Theunis' wall safe. The snapshot I handled with a
   disconcerting mixture of emotions. Even after I had replaced it in the
   envelope with the rest I had a morbid longing to save it and gloat over
   it and rush out and up the hill toward its original. Peculiar
   line-arrangements sprang out of its details to assault and puzzle my
   memory...pictures behind pictures...secrets lurking in half-familiar
   shapes...But a saner contrary instinct, operating at the same time,
   gave me the vigor and avidity of unplaceable fear as I hastily kindled
   a fire in the grate and watched the problematic envelope burn to ashes.
   Somehow I felt that the earth had been purged of a horror on whose
   brink I had trembled, and which was none the less monstrous because I
   did not know what it was.

   Of the source of Theunis' terrific shock I could form no coherent
   guess, nor did I dare to think too closely about it. It is notable that
   I did not at any time have the least impulse to look through the box
   before removing the gem and photograph. What was shown in the picture
   by the antique crystal's lens or prism-like power was not, I felt
   curiously certain, anything that a normal brain ought to be called upon
   to face. Whatever it was, I had myself been close to it--had been
   completely under the spell of its allurement--as it brooded on that
   remote hill in the form of a tree and an unfamiliar landscape. And I
   did not wish to know what I had so narrowly escaped.

   Would that my ignorance might have remained complete! I could sleep
   better at night. As it was, my eye was arrested before I left the room
   by the pile of scattered papers rustling on the table beside the black
   box. All but one were blank, but that one bore a crude drawing in
   pencil. Suddenly recalling what Theunis had once said about sketching
   the horror revealed by the gem, I strove to turn away; but sheer
   curiosity defeated my sane design. Looking again almost furtively, I
   observed the nervous haste of the stroke, and the unfinished edge left
   by the sketcher's terrified seizure. Then, in a burst of perverse
   boldness, I looked squarely at the dark and forbidden design--and fell
   in a faint.

   I shall never describe fully what I saw. After a time I regained my
   senses, thrust the sheet into the dying fire, and staggered out through
   the quiet streets to my home. I thanked God that I had not looked
   through the crystal at the photograph, and prayed fervently that I
   might forget the drawing's terrible hint of what Theunis had beheld.
   Since then I have never been quite the same. Even the fairest scenes
   have seemed to hold some vague, ambiguous hint of the nameless
   blasphemies which may underlie them and form their masquerading
   essence. And yet the sketch was so slight--so little indicative of all
   that Theunis, to judge from his guarded accounts later on, must have
   discerned!

   Only a few basic elements of the landscape were in the thing. For the
   most part a cloudy, exotic-looking vapor dominated the view. Every
   object that might have been familiar was seen to be part of something
   vague and unknown and altogether un-terrestrial--something infinitely
   vaster than any human eye could grasp, and infinitely alien, monstrous,
   and hideous as guessed from the fragment within range.

   Where I had, in the landscape itself, seen the twisted, half-sentient
   tree, there was here visible only a gnarled, terrible hand or talon
   with fingers or feelers shockingly distended and evidently groping
   toward something on the ground or in the spectator's direction. And
   squarely below the writhing, bloated digits I thought I saw an outline
   in the grass where a man had lain. But the sketch was hasty, and I
   could not be sure.

   PART I

   THE GREAT REMEMBRANCE

   Read at the Annual Reunion of the Society of the Army of the Potomac,
   Faneuil Hall, Boston, June 27, 1893.

   Comrades, the circle narrows, heads grow white,
   As once more by the camp-fire's flaring light
   We gather and clasp hands, as we have done
   These many, many years. So long ago
   A part we were of all that glorious show,--
   Stood, side by side, 'neath the red battle-sun,--
   So long ago we breathed war's thunderous breath,
   Knew the white fury of that life-in-death,
   So long ago that troubled joy, it seems
   The valorous pageant might resolve to splendid dreams.
    But no! Too deep 't is burned into the brain!
   As well were lightning-scar by summer rain
   Washed clean away, when stroke on blinding stroke
   Hath torn the rock, and riven the blackened oak.
    How oft as down these peaceful streets we pass
   All vanishes save, lo! the rutted grass,
   Wreckt caissons, frightened beasts, and, merciful God!
   The piteous burden of the ensanguined sod!
    Yet not all terror doth the memory save
   From war's emblazonry and open grave:
   In glimpses, flashing like a meteor's light,
   A silent army marches through the night;
   The guidons flutter in a golden valley
   Where, at the noonday halt, the horsemen dally;
   Or, look! a thousand tents gleam through the black;
   Or, now, where quick-built camp-fires flame and crack,
   From blaze to shade men stretch o'erwearied limbs,
   Chant songs, or wake the hills with chorused hymns;
   Or, ere the dawn makes pale the starry dark,
   The fiery signals, spark on trailing spark,
   Write on the silent sky their still command,
   While the great army moves, drawn by a single hand.

    So long ago it seems, so long ago,
   Behold, our sons, grown men since those great days,--
   Born since the last clear bugle ceased to blow
   Its summons down the valley; since the bays
   Shook with the roar of fort and answering fleet,--
   Our very children look into our eyes
   And find strange records, with a mute surprise;
   As they some curious traveler might greet
   Who kept far countries in his musing mind,
   Beyond the weltering seas, the mountain-walls behind.
    And yet it was this land and not another,
   Where blazed war's flame and rolled the battle-cloud.
   In all this land there was no home where brother,
   Father, or son hurried not forth; where bowed
   No broken-hearted woman when pale Death
   Laid his cold finger on the loved one's breath.

    Like to a drama did the scene unroll--
   Some dark, majestic drama of the soul,
   Wherein all strove as actors, hour by hour,
   Yet breathless watched the whole swift, tragic play.
   Faithful did each his little part essay,
   Urged to an end unknown by one all-knowing Power;
   While if the drama pauses, now and then,
   On the huge stage, 't is for a moment only--
   Here at the heart or in some vista lonely,
   A single hero or a million men,
   And with the tragic theme the world resounds again.
    First, in the awful waiting came the shock,
   The shame unbearable, the sacred flag assailed--
   Assailed in freedom's name by those who freedom mock!
   Ah, then the oath, to stand as stands the rock
   'Gainst flood and tempest, lest that flag be trailed
   And torn, or any star therefrom be lost--
   The oath, murmured alone, or where the crowd,
   As by a wind of heaven swept and tost,
   Passioned its soul to God, and strong men wept aloud.
    Then sweet farewell; O bitter-sweet farewell;
   O brave farewell! Who were the bravest then,
   Or they who went, or waited--women or men?
   They who the cheers heard, or the funeral knell?
   They who stept proudly to the rattling drum,
   Inflamed by war's divine delirium,
   Or they who knew no mad joy of the fight,
   And yet breathed on through waiting day and weeping night?

    Farewell and forward! O, to live it over,
   The first wild heart-beat of heroic hours!
   Forward, like mountain-torrents after showers!
   Forward to death, as to his bride the lover!
   Forward, till quick recoils the impetuous flood,
   And ends the first dread scene in terror and in blood!
    Onward once more, through sun and shivering storm,--
   A monstrous length with wavering bulk enorm,--
   Wounded or striking, bringing blood or bleeding,
   Onward, still on, the agony unheeding!
   Onward with failing heart, or courage high!
   Onward through heat, and hunger, and dismay,
   Turning the starry night to murderous day!
   Onward, with hope appalled, once more to strike, and die!

    So marched, so fought, so agonized, the hosts;
   Battling through forests; rotting where slow crawls
   The deathly swamp-stream; and like pallid ghosts
   Haunting the hospitals, and loathèd prison-walls.
   They knew what freedom was, and right to breathe
   Clean air who burrowed from the filth and seethe
   Of foulest pens, only that dogs might track,
   And to the death-pit drag their living corpses back.
    O, would to Heaven some sights could fade from out
   Clear memory's all too melancholy page--
   Fade and be gone forever! Let the shout
   Of victory only linger, and the rage
   And glory of battle over land and sea,
   And all that noblest is in war's fierce pageantry.
    Echoes of deeds immortal, O, awake!
   Tremble to language, into music break,
   Till lyric memory takes the old emotion,
   And leaps from heart to heart the ancient thrill!
   Tell of great deeds that yet the wide earth fill:
   How first upon the amazèd waves of ocean
   The black, infernal, deadly armored-ships
   Together rushed, and all the world stood still,
   While a new word of war burst from those iron lips;
   How up the rivers thundered the strong fleets;
   How the great captains 'gainst each other dashed
   Gigantic armies. What wild welcome meets
   Some well-loved chief who, ere those armies clashed,
   Rides like a whirlwind the embattled line,
   Kindling the stricken ranks to bravery divine!
   And, hark, at set of sun, the cheer that greets
   Victorious news from far-off armies, flashed
   From camp to camp, with roar on answering roar,
   Like bellowing waves that track the tempest down the shore.
    But chiefly tell of that one hour of all
   When threatening war rolled highest its full tide,
   Even to the perilous northern mountain-side
   Where Heaven should bid our good cause rise or fall.
   Tell of that hour, for never in all the world
   Was braver army 'gainst a braver hurled.
   To both the victory, all unawares,
   Beyond all dreams of losing or of winning;
   For the new land which now is ours and theirs,
   Had on that topmost day its glorious beginning.
   They who charged up that drenched and desperate slope
   Were heroes all--and looked in heroes' eyes!
   Ah! heroes never heroes did despise!
   That day had Strife its bloodiest bourn and scope;
   Above the shaken hills and sulphurous skies
   Peace lifted up her mournful head and smiled on Hope.

    Rushed the great drama on its tragic way
   Swift to the happy end from that tremendous day.
   Happy, indeed, could memory lose her power
   And yield to joy alone the glad, triumphant hour;
   Happy if every aching heart could shun
   Remembrance of the unreturning one;
   If at the Grand Review, when mile on mile
   And day on day the marching columns past,
   Darkened not o'er the world the shadow vast
   Of his foul murder--he the free from guile,
   Sad-hearted, loving, and beloved, and wise,
   Who ruled with sinewy hands and dreaming eyes.
   What soul that lived then who remembers not
   The hour, the landscape, ah! the very spot,--
   Hateful for aye,--where news that he was slain
   Struck like a hammer on the dazèd brain!

    So long ago it was, so long ago,
   All, all have past; the terror and the splendor
   Have turned like yester-evening's stormy glow
   Into a sunset memory strange and tender.
   How beautiful it seems, what lordly sights,
   What deeds sublime, what wondrous days and nights,
   What love of comrades, ay, what quickened breath,
   When first we knew that, startled, quailing, still
   We too, even we, along the blazing hill,
   We, with the best, could face and conquer death!

    Glorious all these, but these all less than naught
   To the one passion of those days divine,
   Love of the land our own hearts' blood had bought--
   Our country, our own country, yours and mine,
   Then known, then sternly loved, first in our lives.
   Ah! loved we not our children, sisters, wives?
   But our own country, this was more than they,--
   Our wives, our children, this,--our hope, our love
   For all most dear, but more--the dawning day
   Of freedom for the world, the hope above
   All hope for the sad race of man. For where,
   In what more lovely world, 'neath skies more fair,
   If freedom here should fail, could it find soil and air?
    In this one thought, one passion,--whate'er fate
   Still may befall,--one moment we were great!
   One moment in life's brief, perplexèd hour
   We climbed the hight of being, and the power
   That falls alone on those who love their kind
   A moment made us one with the Eternal Mind.

    One moment, ah! not so, dear Country! Thou
   Art still our passion; still to thee we bow
   In love supreme! Fairer than e'er before
   Art thou to-day, from golden shore to shore
   The home of freemen. Not one stain doth cling
   Now to thy banner. Argosies of war
   On thy imperial rivers bravely fling
   Flags of the nations, but no message bring
   Save of peace only; while, behold, from far
   The Old World comes to greet thy natal star
   That with the circling century returns,
   And in the Western heavens with fourfold beauty burns.

    Land that we love! Thou Future of the World!
   Thou refuge of the noble heart opprest!
   O, never be thy shining image hurled
   From its high place in the adoring breast
   Of him who worships thee with jealous love!
   Keep thou thy starry forehead as the dove
   All white, and to the eternal Dawn inclined!
   Thou art not for thyself but for mankind,
   And to despair of thee were to despair
   Of man, of man's high destiny, of God!
   Of thee should man despair, the journey trod
   Upward, through unknown eons, stair on stair,
   By this our race, with bleeding feet and slow,
   Were but the pathway to a darker woe
   Than yet was visioned by the heavy heart
   Of prophet. To despair of thee! Ah, no!
   For thou thyself art Hope, Hope of the World thou art!

   Comrades belovèd, see, the fire burns low,
   And darkness thickens. Soon shall our brief part
   On earth forever end, and we shall go
   To join the unseen ranks; nor will we swerve
   Or fear, when to the silent, great reserve
   At last we ordered--are as one by one
   Our Captains have been called, their labors done,
   To rest and wait in the Celestial Field.
   Ay, year by year, we to the dead did yield
   Our bravest. Them we followed to the tomb
   Sorrowing; for they were worthy of our love--
   High-souled and generous, loving peace above
   War and its glories: therefore lives no gloom
   In this our sorrow; rather pride, and praise,
   And gratitude, and memory of old days.
    A little while and these tired hands will cease
   To lift obedient or in war or peace--
   Faithful we trust in peace as once in war;
   And on the scroll of peace some triumphs are
   Noble as battles won; tho' less resounds
   The fame, as deep and bitter are the wounds.
    But now the fire burns low, and we must sleep
   Erelong, while other eyes than ours the vigil keep.
   And after we are gone, to other eyes
   That watch below shall come, in starry skies,
   A fairer dawn, whereon in fiery light
   The Eternal Captain shall his signals write;
   And shaken from rest, and gazing at that sign,
   On shall the mighty Nation move, led by a hand divine.

   PART II

   "THE WHITE CITY"

   (THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION)

   I

   Greece was; Greece is no more.
   Temple and town
   Have crumbled down;
   Time is the fire that hath consumed them all.
   Statue and wall
   In ruin strew the universal floor.

   II

   Greece lives, but Greece no more!
   Its ashes breed
   The undying seed
   Blown westward till, in Rome's imperial towers,
   Athens reflowers;
   Still westward--lo, a veiled and virgin shore!

   III

   Say not, "Greece is no more."
   Through the clear morn
   On light winds borne
   Her white-winged soul sinks on the New World's breast.
   Ah! happy West--
   Greece flowers anew, and all her temples soar!

   IV

   One bright hour, then no more
   Shall to the skies
   These columns rise.
   But tho' art's flower shall fade, again the seed
   Onward shall speed,
   Quickening the land from lake to ocean's roar.

   V

   Art lives, tho' Greece may never
   From the ancient mold
   As once of old
   Exhale to heaven the inimitable bloom;
   Yet from that tomb
   Beauty walks forth to light the world forever!

   THE VANISHING CITY

   I

   Enraptured memory, and all ye powers of being,
    To new life waken! Stamp the vision clear
   On the soul's inmost substance. O, let seeing
    Be more than seeing; let the entrancèd ear
   Take deep these surging sounds, inweaved with light
    Of unimagined radiance; let the intense
   Illumined loveliness that thrills the night
    Strike in the human heart some deeper sense!
   So shall these domes that meet heaven's curvèd blue,
    And yon long, white, imperial colonnade,
   And many-columned peristyle, endue
    The mind with beauty that shall never fade;
   Tho' all too soon to dark oblivion wending--
   Reared in one happy hour to know as swift an ending.

   II

   Thou shalt of all the cities of the world
    Famed for their grandeur, evermore endure
   Imperishably and all alone impearled
    In the world's living thought, the one most sure
   Of love undying and of endless praise
    For beauty only--chief of all thy kind;
   Immortal, even because of thy brief days;
    Thou cloud-built, fairy city of the mind!
   Here man doth pluck from the full tree of life
    The latest, lordliest flower of earthly art;
   This doth he breathe, while resting from his strife,
    This presses he against his weary heart;
   Then, wakening from his dream within a dream,
   He flings the faded flower on Time's down-rushing stream.

   III

   O, never as here in the eternal years
    Hath burst to bloom man's free and soaring spirit,
   Joyous, untrammeled, all untouched by tears
    And the dark weight of woe it doth inherit.
   Never so swift the mind's imaginings
    Caught sculptured form, and color. Never before,--
   Save where the soul beats unembodied wings
    'Gainst viewless skies,--was such enchanted shore
   Jeweled with ivory palaces like these:
    By day a miracle, a dream by night;
   Yet real as beauty is, and as the seas
    Whose waves glance back keen lines of glittering light
   When million lamps, and coronets of fire,
   And fountains as of flame, to the bright stars aspire.

   IV

   Glide, magic boat, from out the green lagoon,
    'Neath the dark bridge, into this smiting glow
   And unthought glory. Even the glistening moon
    Hangs in the nearer splendor. Let not go
   The scene, my soul, till ever 't is thine own!
    This is Art's citadel and crown. How still
   The innumerous multitudes from every zone,
    That watch and listen; while each eye doth fill
   With joyous tears unwept. Now solemn strains
    Of brazen music give the waiting soul
   Voice and a sigh--it other speech disdains,
    Here where the visual sense faints to its goal!
   Ah, silent multitudes, ye are a part
   Of the wise architect's supreme and glorious art!

   V

   O joy almost too high for saddened mortal!
    O ecstasy envisioned! Thou shouldst be
   Lasting as thou art lovely; as immortal
    As through all time the matchless thought of thee!
   Yet would we miss, then, the sweet, piercing pain
    Of thy inconstancy! Could we but banish
   This haunting pang, ah, then thou wouldst not reign
    One with the golden sunset that doth vanish
   Through myriad lingering tints down melting skies;
    Nor the pale mystery of the New World flower
   That blooms once only, then forever dies--
    Pouring a century's wealth on one dear hour.
   Then vanish, City of Dream, and be no more;
   Soon shall this fair Earth's self be lost on the unknown shore.

   THE TOWER OF FLAME

   (THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION, JULY 10, 1893)

   Here for the world to see men brought their fairest,
    Whatever of beauty is in all the earth;
   The priceless flower of art, the loveliest, rarest,
    Here by our inland ocean came to glorious birth.

   Yet on this day of doom a strange new splendor
    Shed its celestial light on all men's eyes:
   Flower of the hero-soul,--consummate, tender,--
    That from the tower of flame sprang to the eternal skies.

   LOWELL

   I

   From the shade of the elms that murmured above thy birth
   And the pines that sheltered thy life and shadowed the end,
   'Neath the white-blue skies thee to thy rest we bore,--
   'Neath the summer skies thou didst love, 'mid the songs of thy birds,
   By thy childhood's stream, 'neath the grass and the flowers thou
   knewest,
   Near the grave of the singer whose name with thine own is enlaureled,
   By the side of the brave who live in thy deathless song,--
   Here all that was mortal of thee we left, with our tears,
   With our love, and our grief that could not be quenched or abated;
   For even the part that was mortal, sweet friend and companion!
   That face, and that figure of beauty, and flashing eye
   Which in youth shone forth like a god's 'mid lesser men,
   And in gray-haired, strenuous age still glowed and lustered,--
   These, too, were dear to us,--blame us not, soaring spirit!
   These, too, were dear, and now we shall never behold them,
   Nor ever shall feel the quick clasp of thy welcoming hand.

   II

   But not for ourselves alone are we spent in grieving,
   For the stricken Land we mourn whose light is darkened,
   Whose soul in sorrow went forth in the night-time with thine.
   Lover and laureate thou of the wide New World,
   Whose pines, and prairies, and people, and teeming soil,
   Where was shaken of old the seed of the freedom of men,
   Thou didst love as a strong man loveth the maiden he woos,--
   Not the woman he toys with, and sings to, and, passing, forgets,--
   Whom he woos, whom he wins, whom he weds; his passion, his pride;
   Who no shadow of wrong shall suffer, who shall stand in his sight
   Pure as the sky of the evil her foeman may threat,
   Save by word or by thought of her own in her whiteness untouched
   And wounded alone of the lightning her spirit engenders.

   III

   Take of thy grief new strength, new life, O Land!
   Weep no more he is lost, but rejoice and be glad forever
   That thy lover who died was born, for thy pleasure, thy glory--
   While his love and his fame light ever thy climbing path.

    August 14, 1891.

   THE SILENCE OF TENNYSON

   When that great shade into the silence vast
   Through thinking silence past;
   When he, our century's soul and voice, was husht,
   We who,--appalled, bowed, crusht,--
   Within the holy moonlight of his death
   Waited the parting breath;
   Ah, not in song
   Might we our grief prolong.
   Silence alone, O golden spirit fled!
   Silence alone could mourn that silence dread.

   ON THE DEATH OF A GREAT MAN

   PHILLIPS BROOKS

   When from this mortal scene
   A great soul passes to the vast unknown,
   Let not in hopeless grief the spirit groan.
   Death comes to all, the mighty and the mean.
   If by that death the whole world suffer loss,
   This be the proof (and lighter thus our cross),
   That he for whom the world doth sorely grieve
   Greatly hath blessed mankind in that he once did live.
   Then, at the parting breath
   Let men praise Life, nor idly blame dark Death.

   A HERO OF PEACE

   IN MEMORY OF ROBERT ROSS: SHOT MARCH 6, 1894

   "No bugle on the blast
    Calls warriors face to face;
   Grim battle being forever past,
    Gone is the hero-race."

   Ah, no! there is no peace!
    If liberty shall live,
   Never may freemen dare to cease
    Their love, their life to give.

   Unto the patriot's heart
    The silent summons comes;
   Not braver he who does his part
    To the sound of beating drums.

   And thou who gavest youth,
    And life, and all most dear;
   Sweet soul, impassionate of truth,
    White on thy murdered bier!--

   Thy deed, thy date, thy name
    Are wreathed with deathless flowers.
   Thy fate shall be the guiding flame
    That lights to nobler hours.

   WASHINGTON AT TRENTON

   THE BATTLE MONUMENT, OCTOBER 19, 1893

   Since ancient Time began,
    Ever on some great soul God laid an infinite burden--
   The weight of all this world, the hopes of man.
    Conflict and pain, and fame immortal are his guerdon!

   And this the unfaltering token
    Of him, the Deliverer--what tho' tempests beat,
   Tho' all else fail, tho' bravest ranks be broken,
    He stands unscared, alone, nor ever knows defeat.

   Such was that man of men;
    And if are praised all virtues, every fame
   Most noble, highest, purest--then, ah! then,
    Upleaps in every heart the name none needs to name.

   Ye who defeated, 'whelmed,
    Betray the sacred cause, let go the trust;
   Sleep, weary, while the vessel drifts unhelmed;
    Here see in triumph rise the hero from the dust!

   All ye who fight forlorn
    'Gainst fate and failure; ye who proudly cope
   With evil high enthroned; all ye who scorn
    Life from Dishonor's hand, here take new heart of hope.

   Here know how Victory borrows
    For the brave soul a front as of disaster,
   And from the bannered East what glorious morrows
    For all the blackness of the night speed surer, faster.

   Know by this pillared sign
    For what brief while the powers of earth and hell
   Can war against the spirit of truth divine,
    Or can against the heroic heart of man prevail.

   FAME

   Fame is an honest thing,
   It is deceivèd not;
   It passes by the palace gates
   Where the crowned usurper waits,
   Enters the peasant-poet's cot
   And cries: "Thou art the king!"

   A MONUMENT BY SAINT-GAUDENS

   This is not Death, nor Sorrow, nor sad Hope;
   Nor Rest that follows strife. But, O, more dread!
   'T is Life, for all its agony serene;
   Immortal, and unmournful, and content.

   A MEMORY OF RUBINSTEIN

   He of the ocean is, its thunderous waves
   Echo his music; while far down the shore
   Mad laughter hurries--a white, blowing spume.
   I hear again in memory that wild storm;
   The winds of heaven go rushing round the world,
   And broods above the rage one sphinx-like face.

   PADEREWSKI

   I

   If songs were perfume, color, wild desire;
   If poet's words were fire
   That burned to blood in purple-pulsing veins;
   If with a bird-like thrill the moments throbbed to hours;
   If summer's rains
   Turned drop by drop to shy, sweet, maiden flowers;
   If God made flowers with light and music in them,
   And saddened hearts could win them;
   If loosened petals touched the ground
   With a caressing sound;
    If love's eyes uttered word
   No listening lover e'er before had heard;
   If silent thoughts spake with a bugle's voice;
   If flame passed into song and cried, "Rejoice! Rejoice!"
    If words could picture life's, hope's, heaven's eclipse
   When the last kiss has fallen on dying eyes and lips;
   If all of mortal woe
   Struck on one heart with breathless blow on blow;
    If melody were tears, and tears were starry gleams
   That shone in evening's amethystine dreams;
   Ah, yes, if notes were stars, each star a different hue,
   Trembling to earth in dew;
   Or if the boreal pulsings, rose and white,
   Made a majestic music in the night;
   If all the orbs lost in the light of day
   In the deep, silent blue began their harps to play;
    And when in frightening skies the lightnings flashed
   And storm-clouds crashed,
   If every stroke of light and sound were but excess of beauty;
   If human syllables could e'er refashion
   That fierce electric passion;
   If other art could match (as were the poet's duty)
   The grieving, and the rapture, and the thunder
   Of that keen hour of wonder,--
   That light as if of heaven, that blackness as of hell,--
   How the great master plays then might I dare to tell.

   II

    How the great master plays! And was it he
   Or some disbodied spirit which had rushed
   From silence into singing; and had crushed
   Into one startled hour a life's felicity,
   And highest bliss of knowledge--that all pain, grief, wrong,
   Turn at the last to beauty and to song!

   HANDEL'S LARGO

   When the great organs, answering each to each,
   Joined with the violin's celestial speech,
   Then did it seem that all the heavenly host
   Gave praise to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:
   We saw the archangels through the ether winging;
   We heard their souls go forth in solemn singing;
   "Praise, praise to God," they sang, "through endless days,
   Praise to the Eternal One, and naught but praise";
   And as they sang the spirits of the dying
   Were upward borne from lips that ceased their sighing;
   And dying was not death, but deeper living--
   Living, and prayer, and praising and thanksgiving!

   THE STAIRWAY

   By this stairway narrow, steep,
   Thou shalt climb from song to sleep;
   From sleep to dream and song once more;--
   Sleep well, sweet friend, sleep well, dream deep!

   THE ACTOR

   Glorious that ancient art!--
   In thine own form to show the fire and fashion
   Of every age and clime, of every passion
   That dwells in man's deep heart!

   Player, play well, not meanly,
   Thy part in life, as on the mimic stage!
   From highest thought is born art's noblest rage:
   Live, act, end all, serenely!

   THE STRICKEN PLAYER

   When at life's last the stricken player lies,
   When throng before his darkened, dreaming eyes
   His soul's companions, which more real then--
   The human comrades, the live women and men
   Of the large world he knew, or the ideal
   Imagined creatures his own art made real;
   Wherein he poured his spirit's very being,
   His soul and body? Are those dim eyes seeing
   Himself as one of Shakespeare's men? Are maids
   And queens he wooed, the kings he was, or knew
   Upon the tragic stage, are these the shades
   That now his visionary hours pursue,
   Attendant on his passing? Listen near!
   What breathed murmurs 'scape those pallid lips
   To which the nations hearkened, ere the eclipse
   Of all that brightness? Now lean close and hear;
   Ah, see that look, sweeter than when he smiled
   Upon the applauding world, while she draws near
   And hears a dear voice whisper: "Child, my Child!"

   AN AUTUMN DIRGE

   (E. F. H.)

   I

   O ease my heart, sad song, O ease my heart!
   In all this autumn pageantry no part
   Hath sorrow! Woods, and fields, and meadows glow
   With jeweled colors. All alone I go
   Amid the poignant beauty of the year,
   Too heavy-hearted for one easeful tear.
    For she who loved this autumn splendor,
   These flaming marsh-flowers, oak-leaves rich and tender,--
   And who in loving all, made all to me more dear,--
   No more is here;
   No more, no more is here!
    Sad song, O, bring some thought
   With music from some happy memory caught!
   No light for me in all the lovely day
   Those eyes being shut that first did lead the way
   'Neath these great pines whose green vault hides the sky,
   And down the rock-strewn shore where the white sea-birds cry!

   II

    All fades but those young, happy hours,
   And in my soul once more the old joy flowers.
   It flowers once more only to bring new pain;
   For all in vain,
   O song! thou singest in my grieving heart!
   Thou hast no art
   To bring again the smile I loved so well,
   The voice that like a bell
   Sounded all moods of sorrow and of laughter,
   And the dear presence that in childhood's earliest thought,
   And all the bright or darkened days thereafter,
   Into my life a saddened sweetness brought--
   Something of mother and of sister love,
   A friendship far above
   The ties that bind and loosen as we tread
   The throngèd pleasures of life's later days.
    Sweet maiden soul, I cannot praise
   But mourn thee, mourn thee, to the shadows fled.

   II

    Shadows, O nevermore!
   For when past forth thy spirit it did seem
   As if against the black a golden door
   Were opened and a gleam
   From the eternal Light fell on thy face
   And made a visible glory in the place.
    Ah, well I know
   Whatever be the source from whence we flow,
   Whate'er the power begot these hearts of ours,--
   As the great earth brings forth the summer flowers,--
   That power is good, is God, and in her dying room
   Humaned itself to sense and lightened all the gloom.

   ELEONORA DUSE

   If ever flashed upon this mortal scene
   A soul unsheathèd, a pale, trembling flame,
   That suffered every gust, and yet did cling
   With fire unquenchable--it is thine own,
   Thou artist of the real! Unto thee
   No mirth of life is secret; but, sweet soul,
   With what sure art thou picturest human woe!
   How natural tears to those Italian eyes--
   Shadowing in untold depths whatever grief Familiar is to mortals!

   KELP ROCK

   (E. C. S.)

   Rock's the song-soil, truly
   (So sang one bard of power);
   Therefore our poet duly
   Built on this rock his tower;
   And therefore in his singing
   We breathe the salty morning;
   We hear the storm-bell ringing,
   The "siren's" piercing warning,
   The sea-winds roaring, sighing,
   The long waves rising, falling;
   We hear the herons calling,
   The clashing waves replying.

   AT NIAGARA

   I

   There at the chasm's edge behold her lean
   Trembling as, 'neath the charm,
   A wild bird lifts no wing to 'scape from harm;
   Her very soul drawn to the glittering, green,
   Smooth, lustrous, awful, lovely curve of peril;
   While far below the bending sea of beryl
   Thunder and tumult--whence a billowy spray
   Enclouds the day.

   II

   What dream is hers? No dream hath wrought that spell!
   The long waves rise and sink;
   Pity that virgin soul on passion's brink,
   Confronting Fate,--swift, unescapable,--
   Fate, which of nature is the intent and core,
   And dark and strong as the steep river's pour,
   Cruel as love, and wild as love's first kiss!
   Ah, God! the abyss!

   THE CHILD-GARDEN

   In the child-garden buds and blows
   A blossom lovelier than the rose.

   If all the flowers of all the earth
   In one garden broke to birth,

   Not the fairest of the fair
   Could with this sweet bloom compare;

   Nor would all their shining be
   Peer to its lone bravery.

   Fairer than the rose, I say?
   Fairer than the sun-bright day

   In whose rays all glories show,
   All beauty is, all blossoms blow;

   While beside it deeply shine
   Blooms that take its light divine:

   The perilous sweet flower of Hope
   Here its hiding eyes doth ope,

   And Gentleness doth near uphold
   Its healing leaves and heart of gold;

   Here tender fingers push the seed
   Of Knowledge; pluck the poisonous weed;

   Here blossoms Joy one singing hour,
   And here of Love the immortal flower.

   What this blossom, fragrant, tender,
   That outbeams the rose's splendor--

   Purer is, more tinct with light
   Than the lily's flame of white?

   Of beauty hath this flower the whole,
   And its name--the Human Soul!

   THE CHRIST-CHILD

   A PICTURE BY FRANK VINCENT DU MOND

   Done is the day of care.
   Into the shadowy room
   Flows the pure evening light,
   To stem the gathering gloom,
   The lily's flame illume,
   And the bowed heads make bright
   The heads bowed low in prayer.

    See how the level rays
   Through the white garments pour
   Of the holy child, who stands,
   With bending brow, to implore
   Grace on the toilers' store;
   O, see those sinless hands!
   Behold, the Christ-child prays!

    Wait, wait, ye lingering rays,
   Stand still, O Earth and Sun,
   Draw near, thou Soul of God--
   This is the suffering one!
   Already the way is begun
   The piercèd Savior trod;
   And now the Christ-child prays,
   The holy Christ-child prays.

   A CHILD

   Her voice was like the song of birds;
    Her eyes were like the stars;
   Her little waving hands were like
    Bird's wings that beat the bars.

   And when those waving hands were still,--
    Her soul had fled away,--
   The music faded from the air,
    The color from the day.

   TWO VALLEYS

   Yes, 't is a glorious sight,
   This valley, that mountain hight.

   The river plunges and roars
   Like the loud sea on its shores

   What time in waves enorm
   Breaks the gigantic storm.

   The wooded mount doth climb
   To a thought intense, sublime.

   The glory of all I feel;
   But my heart, my heart, will steal

   Down the journey of years,
   Through the lands of laughter and tears,

   Far back to the least of valleys
   Where a slow brook curves and dallies,

   Where a boy, in the twilight gleam,
   Walks alone with his dream.

   ON THE BAY

   This watery vague how vast! This misty globe,
   Seen from this center where the ferry plies,--
   It plies, but seems to poise in middle air,--
   Soft gray below gray heavens, and in the west
   A rose-gray memory of the sunken sun;
   And, where gray water touches grayer sky,
   A band of darker gray prickt out with lights--
   A diamond-twinkling circlet bounding all;
   And where the statue looms, a quenchless star;
   And where the lighthouse, a red, pulsing flame;
   While the great bridge its starry diadem
   Lifts through the gray, itself in grayness lost!

   WASHINGTON SQUARE

   This is the end of the town that I love the best.
   O, lovely the hour of light from the burning west--
   Of light that lingers and fades in the shadowy square
   Where the solemn fountain lifts a shaft in the air
   To catch the skyey colors, and fling them down
   In a wild-wood torrent that drowns the noise of the town.
   And lovely the hour of the still and dreamy night
   When, lifted against the blue, stands the arch of white
   With one clear planet above; and the sickle moon,
   In curve reversed from the arch's marble round,
   Silvers the sapphire sky. Now soon, ah, soon,
   Shall the city square be turned to holy ground,
   Through the light of the moon and the stars and the glowing flower,--
   The Cross of Light,--that looms from the sacred tower.

   THE CITY

   O, dear is the song of the pine
    When the wind of the night-time blows,
   And dear is the murmuring river
    That afar through my childhood flows;
   And soft is the raindrop's beat
    And the fountain's lyric play,
   But to me no music is half so sweet
    As the thunder of Broadway!

   Stream of the living world
    Where dash the billows of strife!--
   One plunge in the mighty torrent
    Is a year of tamer life!
   City of glorious days,
    Of hope, and labor, and mirth,
   With room, and to spare, on thy splendid bays
    For the ships of all the earth!

   A RHYME OF TYRINGHAM

   Down in the meadow and up on the hight
   The breezes are blowing the willows white.
   In the elms and maples the robins call,
   And the great black crow sails over all
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   The river winds through the trees and the brake
   And the meadow-grass like a shining snake;
   And low in the summer and loud in the spring
   The rapids and reaches murmur and sing
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   In the shadowy pools the trout are shy,
   So creep to the bank and cast the fly!
   What thrills and tremors the tense cords stir
   When the trout it strikes with a tug and a whir
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley!

   At dark of the day the mist spreads white,
   Like a magic lake in the glimmering light;
   Or the winds from the meadow the white mists blow,
   And the fireflies glitter,--a sky below,--
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   And O, in the windy days of the fall
   The maples and elms are scarlet all,
   And the world that was green is gold and red,
   And with huskings and cider they 're late to bed
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   Now squirrel and partridge and hawk and hare
   And wildcat and woodchuck and fox beware!
   The three days' hunt is waxing warm
   For the Count Up Dinner at Riverside Farm
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   The meadow-ice will be freezing soon,
   And then for a skate by the light of the moon.
   So pile the wood on the hearth, my boy!
   Winter is coming! I wish you joy
   By the light of the hearth and the moon, my boy,
    In Tyringham, Tyringham Valley.

   ELSIE

   "Do you love me?" Elsie asked,
   And her rose-leaf dimples masked
   'Neath a pleading look, the while
   On her pouting lips a smile
   Hovered, yet was out of sight
   Like a star that's hid at night
   By a filmy, flying cloud.
   "Do you love me?" scarce aloud
   Lovely Cousin Elsie said.
   "Why no answer, Cousin Ed?
   Do you hate me, then, or why
   From Your Highness no reply?"
   So the chiding witch ran on:
   "In a moment I'll be gone;
   Then too late, Sir No Gallant!
   Quick! I'll tell my precious aunt
   That you love me not," she cries,
   "That you hate me and despise."
   Flash the great, gray, long-lashed eyes;
   Half in earnest now the girl;
   Down the pretty corners curl
   Of the tiny mouth, and lo!
   From those eyes two tearlets flow;--
   Just two kisses, and they go!
   Like a sunburst after showers,
   Like white light upon the flowers,
   Now again the dimples show.
    But she could not understand
   Why so long the answer waited
   For the loved and not the hated,
   While he held that little hand,
   And like a bird she sang and said,--
   Half in earnest, half in fun,--
   "Do you love me, Solemn One?
   Do you love me, Cousin Ed?
   Do you love me? Do you love me?
   Love me, love me, Cousin Ed?"

   INDIRECTION

   I saw not the leaf
    But its shadow trembling, trembling down.
   I faced to northward, to my grief,
    When from the southern sky a crimson meteor lit the star-dark town.
   I saw not naked Love
   Lean from his porphyry throne above
   And touch her heart to flame,
   Yet on her brow I saw the swift, sweet, virgin shame.

   "AH, BE NOT FALSE"

   Ah, be not false, sweet Splendor!
    Be true, be good;
   Be wise as thou art tender;
    Be all that Beauty should.

   Not lightly be thy citadel subdued;
    Not ignobly, not untimely.
   Take praise in solemn mood;
    Take love sublimely.

   THE ANSWER

   Through starry space two angels dreamed their flight,
   'Mid worlds and thoughts of worlds, through day and night.

   Then one spake forth whose voice was like the flower
   That blossoms in the fragrant midnight hour.
   This white-browed angel of the other asked:
    "Of all the essences that ever basked
   In the eternal presence; of all things,
   All thoughts, all joys, all dreads, all sorrowings
   Amid the unimaginable vast--
   Being, or shall be, or forever past--
   Profound with dark, or hid in endless light--
   Which of all these most deep and infinite?"
    Then did the elder speak, the while he turned
   On him who asked clear eyes that slowly burned
   The spirit through, like to a living coal:
   "No depth there is so deep as woman's soul."

   HOW DEATH MAY MAKE A MAN

   Death is a sorry plight,
    It bringeth unto man
   End of all delight.
   Yet many a woeful wight
    Only dying can
    Quit him like a man.

   Dawdling, drawling, silly,
    Maundering, scarce a man;
   Driven willy-nilly;
   When he's dying will he
    Run as once he ran,
    Or quit him like a man?

   Vile from out the wrack
    Crawls he less than man;
   Cowering in his track
   Beaten, broken, black;
    Curse him if you can--
    Death may make him man.

   In life the wretch did naught
    Worthy of a man;
   Now by Death he's caught,
   What a change is wrought!
    Whom the world did ban
    Quits life like a man.

   Braced stiff against the wall,
    Behold, at last, a man.
   Lost--life and honor, all!
   At Death's quick touch and call
    See, the craven can
    Quit him like a man.

   "CAME TO A MASTER OF SONG"

   Came to a master of song
    And the human heart
   One who had followed him long
    And worshiped his art;
   One whom the poet's singing
    Had lured from death,
   Joy to the crusht soul bringing
    And heaven's breath;

   Came to him once in an hour
    Of terror and stress,
   And cried, "Thou alone hast power
    To save me and bless;
   Thou alone, pure heart and free,
    Canst pluck from disaster,
   If to a wretch like me
    Thou wilt stoop, O master!"

   Answered the bard with shame,
    And sorrow and trembling:
   "Was I false, was my song to blame?
    Was my art dissembling?
   I of all mortals the saddest,
    The quickest to fall,
   And song of mine highest and gladdest
    Repentance all!"

   BARDS

   Some from books resound their rhymes--
    Set them ringing with a faint,
    Sorrowful, and sweet, and quaint
   Memory of the olden times,
   Like the sound of evening chimes.

   Some go wandering on their way
    Through the forest, past the herds,
    Laughing maidens, singing birds;
   On their sylvan lutes they play--
   Danceth by the lyric Day!

   Bards there be the deep sky under
    Who in high, authentic verse
    Mysteries and moods rehearse
   With a voice like Sinai's thunder,
   Chanting to a world of wonder.

   And those have sung whose melody,
    Drawn from out the living heart
    With a quick, unfaltering art,
   Hath power to make the listener cry:
   "God in heaven! It is I."

   MERIDIAN

   Henceforth before these feet
   Sinks the downward way;
   A little while to greet
   The light and life of day,
   Then night's slow fall
   Ends all.

   Now forward, heart elate,
   Tho' steep the pathway slope.
   Time yet for love and hate,
   Joy, and joy's comrade, hope,
   Ere night's slow fall
   Ends all.

   Still the warm sky is blue,
   No fleck the sunlight mars;
   'Twixt hills the sea gleams through;
   With twilight come the stars;
   And night's slow fall
   Ends all.

   In the cool-breathing night
   The starry sky is deep.
   Still on through glimmering light
   Till we lie down to sleep;
   Then let night's fall
   End all.

   EVENING IN TYRINGHAM VALLEY

   What domes and pinnacles of mist and fire
    Are builded in yon spacious realms of light
   All silently, as did the walls aspire
    Templing the ark of God by day and night!
   Noiseless and swift, from darkening ridge to ridge,
    Through purple air that deepens down the day,
   Over the valley springs a shadowy bridge.
    The evening star's keen, solitary ray
   Makes more intense the silence, and the glad,
    Unmelancholy, restful, twilight gloom--
   So full of tenderness, that even the sad
    Remembrances that haunt the soul take bloom
   Like that on yonder mountain.
    Now the bars
    Of sunset all burn black; the day doth fail,
   And the skies whiten with the eternal stars.
    O, let thy spirit stay with me, sweet vale!

   PART III

   A WEEK'S CALENDAR

   I--NEW YEAR

   Each New Year is a leaf of our love's rose;
   It falls, but quick another rose-leaf grows.
   So is the flower from year to year the same,
   But richer, for the dead leaves feed its flame.

   II--A NEW SOUL

   To see the rose of morning slow unfold
   Each wondrous petal to that heart of gold;
   To see from out the dark, unknowing night
   A new soul dawn with such undreamed-of light,
   And slowly all its loveliness and splendor
   Pour forth as stately music pours, magnificently tender!

   III--"KEEP PURE THY SOUL"

   Keep pure thy soul!
   Then shalt thou take the whole
   Of delight;
   Then, without a pang,
   Thine shall be all of beauty whereof the poet sang--
   The perfume, and the pageant, the melody, the mirth
   Of the golden day, and the starry night;
   Of heaven, and of earth.
   O, keep pure thy soul!

   IV--"THY MIND IS LIKE A CRYSTAL BROOK

   Thy mind is like a crystal brook
   Wherein clean creatures live at ease,
   In sun-bright waves or shady nook.
   Birds sing above it,
   The warm-breathed cattle love it,
   It doth sweet childhood please.

   Accurst be he by whom it were undone,
   Or thing or thought whose presence
   The birds and beasts would loathly shun,
   Would make its crystal waters foully run,
   And drive sweet childhood from its pleasance.

   V--"ONE DEED MAY MAR A LIFE"

   One deed may mar a life,
    And one can make it;
   Hold firm thy will for strife,
    Lest a quick blow break it!
   Even now from far on viewless wing
   Hither speeds the nameless thing
    Shall put thy spirit to the test.
   Haply or e'er yon sinking sun
    Shall drop behind the purple West
   All will be lost--or won!

   VI--THE UNKNOWN

   How strange to look upon the life beyond
   Our human cognizance with so deep awe
   And haunting dread; a sense as of remorse,
   A looking-for of judgment, a great weight
   Of things unknown to happen! We who live
   Blindly from hour to hour in very midst
   Of mysteries; of shapeless, changing glooms;
   Of nameless terrors; issues vast and black;
   Of airy whims, slight fantasies, and flights
   That lead to unimaginable woe:
   The unweighed word cloying the life of love;
   One clod of earth outblotting all the stars;
   Some secret, dark inheritance of will,
   And the scared soul plunges to conscious doom!
   Thou who hast wisdom, fear not Death, but Life!

   VII--IRREVOCABLE

   Would the gods might give
   Another field for human strife;
   Man must live one life
   Ere he learns to live.
   --Ah, friend, in thy deep grave,
   What now can change, what now can save?

   PART IV

   SONGS

   "BECAUSE THE ROSE MUST FADE"

   Because the rose must fade,
    Shall I not love the rose?
   Because the summer shade
    Passes when winter blows,
   Shall I not rest me there
   In the cool air?

   Because the sunset sky
    Makes music in my soul,
   Only to fail and die,
    Shall I not take the whole
   Of beauty that it gives
   While yet it lives?

   Because the sweet of youth
    Doth vanish all too soon,
   Shall I forget, forsooth,
    To learn its lingering tune;
   My joy to memorize
   In those young eyes?

   If, like the summer flower
    That blooms--a fragrant death,
   Keen music hath no power
    To live beyond its breath,
   Then of this flood of song
   Let me drink long!

   Ah, yes, because the rose
    Fades like the sunset skies;
   Because rude winter blows
    All bare, and music dies--
   Therefore, now is to me
   Eternity!

   "FADES THE ROSE"

   Fades the rose; the year grows old;
   The tale is told;
   Youth doth depart--
   Only stays the heart.

   Ah, no! if stays the heart,
   Youth can ne'er depart,
   Nor the sweet tale be told--
   Never the rose fade, nor the year grow old.

   THE WINTRY HEART

   On the sad winter trees
    The dead, red leaves remain,
   Tho' to and fro the bleak winds blow,
    And falls the freezing rain.

   So to the wintry heart
    Clings color of the past,
   While through dead leaves shudders and grieves
    The melancholy blast.

   HAST THOU HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE?

   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.
    As in dark woods I wandered,
    And dreamed and pondered,
    A voice past by all fire
    And passion and desire;
    I rather felt than heard
    The song of that lone bird;
   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.

   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.
    I heard it, and I followed;
    The warm night swallowed
    This soul and body of mine,
    As burning thirst takes wine,
    While on and on I prest
    Close to that singing breast;
   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.

   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.
    Well doth each throbbing ember
    The flame remember;
    And I, how quick that sound
    Turned drops from a deep wound!
    How this heart was the thorn
    Which pierced that breast forlorn!
   Yes, I have heard the nightingale.

   "IN THAT DREAD, DREAMED-OF HOUR"

   In that dread, dreamed-of hour
    When in her heart love's rose flames into flower,
   'T is never, never yes,
    But no, no, no, whate'er the startled eyes confess.

   Her frail denial at last
    Swept clean away like burnt leaves in the blast,
   No longer no, no, no!
    But yes, forever yes, while love's red rose doth blow.

   "ROSE-DARK THE SOLEMN SUNSET"

   Rose-dark the solemn sunset
    That holds my thought of thee;
   With one star in the heavens
    And one star in the sea.

   On high no lamp is lighted,
    Nor where the long waves flow,
   Save the one star of evening
    And the shadow star below.

   Light of my Life! the darkness
    Comes with the twilight dream;
   Thou art the bright star shining,
    I but the shadowy gleam.

   "WINDS TO THE SILENT MORN"

   Winds to the silent morn;
    Waves to the ocean;
   Voice to the song unsung;
    Song to emotion;
   Light to the golden flower;
    Bird to the tree;
   Love to the heart of love,
    And I to thee!

   Dawn to the darkened world;
    Hope to the morrow;
   Music to passion; and
    Weeping to sorrow;
   Love to the heart that longs;
    Moon to the sea;
   Heaven to the earthborn soul,
    And thou to me.

   THE UNRETURNING

   I

   Silent, silent are the unreturning!
   What tho' word may reach to them, and yearning,
   Never through the stillness of the night,
   Never in the daytime or the dark
   Comes the long-lost voice, or smile of light;
   Lifts no hand from sea or sunken bark.
   Silent, silent are the unreturning!

   II

   Silent, silent are the unreturning!
   Silent they?--or are we undiscerning?
   Child, my child! is this thy answering voice
   Murmuring far down the mountain lone?
   Evening's smile, that whispers: "Heart, rejoice!"
   Mother mine! is this thy very own?
   Nay! nay! Silent are the unreturning;
   Silent, silent are the unreturning!

   TWO YEARS

   O, that was the year the last of those before thee;
    All my world till then but dark before the dawn.
   If then I had died, O, never had I known thee,
   Never had beheld thee; I who won, who own thee;
   Who chose thee, who sing thee, crown thee, and adore thee;
    O, death it were indeed to die before that dawn!

   This was the year when first I did behold thee,
    Thou who on my darkness dawned with lyric light.
   This the golden hour when first thy lover found thee,
   Followed and beguiled thee, and with his singing bound thee;
   When all the world with music rang to drown thee and enfold thee--
    Thou who turned the darkness to song, and love, and light!

   We were sitting on a dilapidated seventeenth-century tomb in the late
   afternoon of an autumn day at the old burying ground in Arkham, and
   speculating about the unnamable. Looking toward the giant willow in the
   cemetery, whose trunk had nearly engulfed an ancient, illegible slab, I
   had made a fantastic remark about the spectral and unmentionable
   nourishment which the colossal roots must be sucking from that hoary,
   charnel earth; when my friend chided me for such nonsense and told me
   that since no interments had occurred there for over a century, nothing
   could possibly exist to nourish the tree in other than an ordinary
   manner. Besides, he added, my constant talk about "unnamable" and
   "unmentionable" things was a very puerile device, quite in keeping with
   my lowly standing as an author. I was too fond of ending my stories
   with sights or sounds which paralyzed my heroes' faculties and left
   them without courage, words, or associations to tell what they had
   experienced. We know things, he said, only through our five senses or
   our intuitions; wherefore it is quite impossible to refer to any object
   or spectacle which cannot be clearly depicted by the solid definitions
   of fact or the correct doctrines of theology--preferably those of the
   Congregationalist, with whatever modifications tradition and Sir Arthur
   Conan Doyle may supply.

   With this friend, Joel Manton, I had often languidly disputed. He was
   principal of the East High School, born and bred in Boston and sharing
   New England's self-satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of
   life. It was his view that only our normal, objective experiences
   possess any esthetic significance, and that it is the province of the
   artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action, ecstasy, and
   astonishment, as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by
   accurate, detailed transcripts of everyday affairs. Especially did he
   object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained; for
   although believing in the supernatural much more fully than I, he would
   not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment.
   That a mind can find its greatest pleasure in escapes from the daily
   treadmill, and in original and dramatic recombinations of images
   usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the hackneyed patterns of
   actual existence, was something virtually incredible to his clear,
   practical, and logical intellect. With him all things and feelings had
   fixed dimensions, properties, causes, and effects; and although he
   vaguely knew that the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of
   far less geometrical, classifiable, and workable nature, he believed
   himself justified in drawing an arbitrary line and ruling out of court
   all that cannot be experienced and understood by the average citizen.
   Besides, he was almost sure that nothing can be really "unnamable." It
   didn't sound sensible to him.

   Though I well realized the futility of imaginative and metaphysical
   arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller, something
   in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual
   contentiousness. The crumbling slate slabs, the patriarchal trees, and
   the centuried gambrel roofs of the witch-haunted old town that
   stretched around, all combined to rouse my spirit in defense of my
   work; and I was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy's own country.
   It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter-attack, for I knew
   that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old-wives' superstitions
   which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance
   of dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old
   faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives. To
   credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued
   a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from
   and subsequent to their material counterparts. It argued a capability
   of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man
   can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world, or
   down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose that
   deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old
   graveyards teem with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of
   generations? And since spirit, in order to cause all the manifestations
   attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter, why
   is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in
   shapes--or absences of shapes--which must for human spectators be
   utterly and appallingly "unnamable"? "Common sense" in reflecting on
   these subjects, I assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a
   stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility.

   Twilight had now approached, but neither of us felt any wish to cease
   speaking. Manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments, and eager to
   refute them, having that confidence in his own opinions which had
   doubtless caused his success as a teacher; whilst I was too sure of my
   ground to fear defeat. The dusk fell, and lights faintly gleamed in
   some of the distant windows, but we did not move. Our seat on the tomb
   was very comfortable, and I knew that my prosaic friend would not mind
   the cavernous rift in the ancient, root-disturbed brickwork close
   behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the
   intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth-century house between
   us and the nearest lighted road. There in the dark, upon that riven
   tomb by the deserted house, we talked on about the "unnamable" and
   after my friend had finished his scoffing I told him of the awful
   evidence behind the story at which he had scoffed the most.

   My tale had been called The Attic Window, and appeared in the January,
   1922, issue of Whispers. In a good many places, especially the South
   and the Pacific coast, they took the magazines off the stands at the
   complaints of silly milk-sops; but New England didn't get the thrill
   and merely shrugged its shoulders at my extravagance. The thing, it was
   averred, was biologically impossible to start with; merely another of
   those crazy country mutterings which Cotton Mather had been gullible
   enough to dump into his chaotic Magnalia Christi Americana, and so
   poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality
   where the horror occurred. And as to the way I amplified the bare
   jotting of the old mystic--that was quite impossible, and
   characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler! Mather had indeed
   told of the thing as being born, but nobody but a cheap sensationalist
   would think of having it grow up, look into people's windows at night,
   and be hidden in the attic of a house, in flesh and in spirit, till
   someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldn't describe what
   it was that turned his hair gray. All this was flagrant trashiness, and
   my friend Manton was not slow to insist on that fact. Then I told him
   what I had found in an old diary kept between 1706 and 1723, unearthed
   among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting; that, and
   the certain reality of the scars on my ancestor's chest and back which
   the diary described. I told him, too, of the fears of others in that
   region, and how they were whispered down for generations; and how no
   mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an abandoned house
   to examine certain traces suspected to be there.

   It had been an eldritch thing--no wonder sensitive students shudder at
   the Puritan age in Massachusetts. So little is known of what went on
   beneath the surface--so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it
   bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses. The witchcraft
   terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in men's crushed
   brains, but even that is a trifle. There was no beauty; no freedom--we
   can see that from the architectural and household remains, and the
   poisonous sermons of the cramped divines. And inside that rusted iron
   straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness, perversion, and diabolism.
   Here, truly, was the apotheosis of The Unnamable.

   Cotton Mather, in that demoniac sixth book which no one should read
   after dark, minced no words as he flung forth his anathema. Stern as a
   Jewish prophet, and laconically un-amazed as none since his day could
   be, he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than
   beast but less than man--the thing with the blemished eye--and of the
   screaming drunken wretch that hanged for having such an eye. This much
   he baldly told, yet without a hint of what came after. Perhaps he did
   not know, or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell. Others knew, but
   did not dare to tell--there is no public hint of why they whispered
   about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a
   childless, broken, embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab
   by an avoided grave, although one may trace enough evasive legends to
   curdle the thinnest blood.

   It is all in that ancestral diary I found; all the hushed innuendoes
   and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the
   night or in deserted meadows near the woods. Something had caught my
   ancestor on a dark valley road, leaving him with marks of horns on his
   chest and of apelike claws on his back; and when they looked for prints
   in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and
   vaguely anthropoid paws. Once a post-rider said he saw an old man
   chasing and calling to a frightful loping, nameless thing on Meadow
   Hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn, and many believed him.
   Certainly, there was strange talk one night in 1710 when the childless,
   broken old man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of
   the blank slate slab. They never unlocked that attic door, but left the
   whole house as it was, dreaded and deserted. When noises came from it,
   they whispered and shivered; and hoped that the lock on that attic door
   was strong. Then they stopped hoping when the horror occurred at the
   parsonage, leaving not a soul alive or in one piece. With the years the
   legends take on a spectral character--I suppose the thing, if it was a
   living thing, must have died. The memory had lingered hideously--all
   the more hideous because it was so secret.

   During this narration my friend Manton had become very silent, and I
   saw that my words had impressed him. He did not laugh as I paused, but
   asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793, and who had
   presumably been the hero of my fiction. I told him why the boy had gone
   to that shunned, deserted house, and remarked that he ought to be
   interested, since he believed that windows latent images of those who
   had sat at them. The boy had gone to look at the windows of that
   horrible attic, because of tales of things seen behind them, and had
   come back screaming maniacally.

   Manton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to
   his analytical mood. He granted for the sake of argument that some
   unnatural monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the
   most morbid perversion of nature need not be unnamable or
   scientifically indescribable. I admired his clearness and persistence,
   and added some further revelations I had collected among the old
   people. Those later spectral legends, I made plain, related to
   monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be;
   apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes
   only tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the
   old house, the crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had
   sprouted beside an illegible slab. Whether or not such apparitions had
   ever gored or smothered people to death, as told in uncorroborated
   traditions, they had produced a strong and consistent impression; and
   were yet darkly feared by very aged natives, though largely forgotten
   by the last two generations--perhaps dying for lack of being thought
   about. Moreover, so far as esthetic theory was involved, if the psychic
   emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions, what coherent
   representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a
   nebulosity as the specter of a malign, chaotic perversion, itself a
   morbid blasphemy against nature? Molded by the dead brain of a hybrid
   nightmare, would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome
   truth the exquisitely, the shriekingly unnamable?

   The hour must now have grown very late. A singularly noiseless bat
   brushed by me, and I believe it touched Manton also, for although I
   could not see him I felt him raise his arm. Presently he spoke.

   "But is that house with the attic window still standing and deserted?"

   "Yes," I answered, "I have seen it."

   "And did you find anything there--in the attic or anywhere else?"

   "There were some bones up under the eaves. They may have been what that
   boy saw--if he was sensitive he wouldn't have needed anything in the
   window-glass to unhinge him. If they all came from the same object it
   must have been an hysterical, delirious monstrosity. It would have been
   blasphemous to leave such bones in the world, so I went back with a
   sack and took them to the tomb behind the house. There was an opening
   where I could dump them in. Don't think I was a fool--you ought to have
   seen that skull. It had four-inch horns, but a face and jaw something
   like yours and mine."

   At last I could feel a real shiver run through Manton, who had moved
   very near. But his curiosity was undeterred.

   "And what about the window-panes?"

   "They were all gone. One window had lost its entire frame, and in all
   the others there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond
   apertures. They were that kind--the old lattice windows that went out
   of use before 1700. I don't believe they've had any glass for a hundred
   years or more--maybe the boy broke 'em if he got that far; the legend
   doesn't say."

   Manton was reflecting again.

   "I'd like to see that house, Carter. Where is it? Glass or no glass, I
   must explore it a little. And the tomb where you put those bones, and
   the other grave without an inscription--the whole thing must be a bit
   terrible."

   "You did see it--until it got dark"

   My friend was more wrought upon than I had suspected, for at this touch
   of harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and
   actually cried out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain
   of previous repression. It was an odd cry, and all the more terrible
   because it was answered. For as it was still echoing, I heard a
   creaking sound through the pitchy blackness, and knew that a lattice
   window was opening in that accursed old house beside us. And because
   all the other frames were long since fallen, I knew that it was the
   grisly glassless frame of that demoniac attic window.

   Then came a noxious rush of noisome, frigid air from that same dreaded
   direction, followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that
   shocking rifted tomb of man and monster. In another instant I was
   knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen
   entity of titanic size but undetermined nature; knocked sprawling on
   the root-clutched mold of that abhorrent graveyard, while from the tomb
   came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy
   peopled the rayless gloom with Miltonic legions of the misshapen
   damned. There was a vortex of withering, ice-cold wind, and then the
   rattle of loose bricks and plaster; but I had mercifully fainted before
   I could learn what it meant.

   Manton, though smaller than I, is more resilient; for we opened our
   eyes at almost the same instant, despite his greater injuries. Our
   couches were side by side, and we knew in a few seconds that we were in
   St. Mary's Hospital. Attendants were grouped about in tense curiosity,
   eager to aid our memory by telling us how we came there, and we soon
   heard of the farmer who had found us at noon in a lonely field beyond
   Meadow Hill, a mile from the old burying ground, on a spot where an
   ancient slaughterhouse is reputed to have stood. Manton had two
   malignant wounds in the chest, and some less severe cuts or gougings in
   the back. I was not so seriously hurt, but was covered with welts and
   contusions of the most bewildering character, including the print of a
   split hoof. It was plain that Manton knew more than I, but he told
   nothing to the puzzled and interested physicians till he had learned
   what our injuries were. Then he said we were the victims of a vicious
   bull--though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for.

   After the doctors and nurses had left, I whispered an awe struck
   question:

   "Good God, Manton, but what was it? Those scars--was it like that?"

   And I was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing I had half
   expected--

   "No--it wasn't that way at all. It was everywhere--a gelatin--a slime
   yet it had shapes, a thousand shapes of horror beyond all memory. There
   were eyes--and a blemish. It was the pit--the maelstrom--the ultimate
   abomination. Carter, it was the unnamable!

   The Very Old Folk
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   70742The Very Old FolkH. P. Lovecraft

   It was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town
   of Pompelo, at the foot of the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior. The year
   must have been in the late republic, for the province was still ruled
   by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prætorian legate of Augustus,
   and the day was the first before the Kalends of November. The hills
   rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town, and the
   westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and
   plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus
   some distance to the east. Groups of citizens -broad-browed Roman
   colonists and coarse-haired Romanised natives, together with obvious
   hybrids of the two strains, alike clad in cheap woollen togas -and
   sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse-mantled, black-bearded
   tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones -all thronged the few paved
   streets and forum; moved by some vague and ill-defined uneasiness.

   I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers
   seemed to have brought in some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus
   to the southward. It appeared that I was a provincial quæstor named L.
   Cælius Rufus, and that I had been summoned by the proconsul, P.
   Scribonius Libo, who had come from Tarraco some days before. The
   soldiers were the fifth cohort of the XIIth legion, under the military
   tribune Sex. Asellius; and the legatus of the whole region, Cn.
   Balbutius, had also come from Calagurris, where the permanent station
   was.

   The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills. All
   the townsfolk were frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort
   from Calagurris. It was the Terrible Season of the autumn, and the wild
   people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies
   which only rumour told of in the towns. They were the very old folk who
   dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the
   Vascones could not understand. One seldom saw them; but a few times a
   year they sent down little yellow, squint-eyed messengers (who looked
   like Scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and
   every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks,
   their howlings and altar-fires throwing terror into the villages.
   Always the same -the night before the Kalends of Maius and the night
   before the Kalends of November. Townsfolk would disappear just before
   these nights, and would never be heard of again. And there were
   whispers that the native shepherds and farmers were not ill-disposed
   toward the very old folk -that more than one thatched hut was vacant
   before midnight on the two hideous Sabbaths.

   This year the horror was very great, for the people knew that the wrath
   of the very old folk was upon Pompelo. Three months previously five of
   the little squint-eyed traders had come down from the hills, and in a
   market brawl three of them had been killed. The remaining two had gone
   back wordlessly to their mountains -and this autumn not a single
   villager had disappeared. There was menace in this immunity. It was not
   like the very old folk to spare their victims at the Sabbath. It was
   too good to be normal, and the villagers were afraid.

   For many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills, and at
   last the ædile Tib. Annæus Stilpo (half native in blood) had sent to
   Balbutius at Calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the Sabbath on the
   terrible night. Balbutius had carelessly refused, on the ground that
   the villagers' fears were empty, and that the loathsome rites of hill
   folk were of no concern to the Roman People unless our own citizens
   were menaced.

   I, however, who seemed to be a close friend of Balbutius, had disagreed
   with him; averring that I had studied deeply in the black forbidden
   lore, and that I believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost
   any nameless doom upon the town, which after all was a Roman settlement
   and contained a great number of our citizens. The complaining ædile's
   own mother Helvia was a pure Roman, the daughter of M. Helvius Cinna,
   who had come over with Scipio's army. Accordingly I had sent a slave -a
   nimble little Greek called Antipater -to the proconsul with letters,
   and Scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered Balbutius to send his
   fifth cohort, under Asellius, to Pompelo; entering the hills at dusk on
   the eve of November's Kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies
   he might find -bringing such prisoners as he might take to Tarraco for
   the next proprætor's court. Balbutius, however, had protested, so that
   more correspondence had ensued. I had written so much to the proconsul
   that he had become gravely interested, and had resolved to make a
   personal inquiry into the horror.

   He had at length proceeded to Pompelo with his lictors and attendants;
   there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed, and
   standing firmly by his order for the Sabbath's extirpation. Desirous of
   conferring with one who had studied the subject, he ordered me to
   accompany Asellius' cohort -and Balbutius had also come along to press
   his adverse advice, for he honestly believed that drastic military
   action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the
   Vascones both tribal and settled.

   So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills -old
   Scribonius Libo in his toga prætexta, the golden light glancing on his
   shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius with his gleaming
   helmet and breastplate, blue-shaven lips compressed in conscientiously
   dogged opposition, young Asellius with his polished greaves and
   superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries,
   tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants. I myself seemed
   to wear a common toga, and to have no especially distinguishing
   characteristic. And everywhere horror brooded. The town and country
   folk scarcely dared speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who
   had been there nearly a week, seemed to have caught something of the
   nameless dread. Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and the sharp
   voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious
   inappropriateness, as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic
   God.

   We entered the prætorium and held grave converse. Balbutius pressed his
   objections, and was sustained by Asellius, who appeared to hold all the
   natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it
   inadvisable to excite them. Both soldiers maintained that we could
   better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised
   natives by inaction, than to antagonise a probable majority of
   tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites.

   I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to
   accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed
   out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain,
   so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever
   course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous
   adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the
   representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere
   with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded.
   That, on the other hand, the successful administration of a province
   depended primarily upon the safety and good-will of the civilized
   element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity
   reposed, and in whose veins a large mixture of our own Italian blood
   coursed. These, though in numbers they might form a minority, were the
   stable element whose constancy might be relied on, and whose
   cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the Imperium of the
   Senate and the Roman People.

   It was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection
   due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot a sarcastic look at
   Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and
   activity, and of a slight interruption of the draught-playing and
   cock-fighting at the camp in Calagurris. That the danger to the town
   and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my studies
   doubt. I had read many scrolls out of Syria and Ægyptus, and the
   cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the
   bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods
   bordering Lacus Nemorensis.

   There were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the
   Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the
   Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at
   Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those
   whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many
   Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia -a matter kept ever
   in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze
   and set open to every eye.

   Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything
   with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the
   Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only
   participants need be apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of
   mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of
   the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and
   policy demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius
   Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the Roman
   People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me
   accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius
   -speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans -might see fit to
   offer and multiply.

   The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed
   draped in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the
   proconsul signified his approval of my words, and stationed me with the
   cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius
   and Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter.
   As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous
   beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm.
   Some few of the legionarii showed timidity, but sharp commands brought
   them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open
   plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted
   on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in
   getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally
   a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to
   take us at least past the foothills.

   We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a
   young moon trembling over the woods on our left. That which disquieted
   us most was the fact that the Sabbath was to be held at all. Reports of
   the coming cohort must have reached the hills, and even the lack of a
   final decision could not make the rumour less alarming -yet there were
   the sinister drums as of yore, as if the celebrants had some peculiar
   reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the Roman People
   marched against them. The sound grew louder as we entered a rising gap
   in the hills, steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on either side,
   and displaying curiously fantastic tree-trunks in the light of our
   bobbing torches.

   All were afoot save Libo, Balbutius, Asellius, two or three of the
   centuriones, and myself, and at length the way became so steep and
   narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of
   ten men being left to guard them, though robber bands were not likely
   to be abroad on such a night of terror. Once in a while it seemed as
   though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby, and after a
   half-hour's climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the
   advance of so great a body of men - over 300, all told - exceedingly
   cumbrous and difficult. Then with utter and horrifying suddenness we
   heard a frightful sound from below. It was from the tethered horses -
   they had screamed, not neighed, but screamed... and there was no light
   down there, nor the sound of any human thing, to show why they had done
   so. At the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead, so
   that terror seemed to lurk equally well before and behind us.

   Looking for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found only a crumpled
   heap weltering in a pool of blood. In his hand was a short sword
   snatched from the belt of D. Vibulanus, a subcenturio, and on his face
   was such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the
   sight. He had killed himself when the horses screamed... He, who had
   been born and lived all his life in that region, and knew what men
   whispered about the hills. All the torches now began to dim, and the
   cries of frightened legionaries mingled with the unceasing screams of
   the tethered horses. The air grew perceptibly colder, more suddenly so
   than is usual at November's brink, and seemed stirred by terrible
   undulations which I could not help connecting with the beating of huge
   wings.

   The whole cohort now remained at a standstill, and as the torches faded
   I watched what I thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by
   the spectral luminosity of the Via Lactea as it flowed through Perseus,
   Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus. Then suddenly all the stars were
   blotted from the sky - even bright Deneb and Vega ahead, and the lone
   Altair and Fomalhaut behind us. And as the torches died out altogether,
   there remained above the stricken and shrieking cohort only the noxious
   and horrible altar-flames on the towering peaks; hellish and red, and
   now silhouetting the mad, leaping, and colossal forms of such nameless
   beasts as had never a Phrygian priest or Campanian grandam whispered of
   in the wildest of furtive tales.

   And above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dæmonic drumming
   rose to louder pitch, whilst an ice-cold wind of shocking sentience and
   deliberateness swept down from those forbidden heights and coiled about
   each man separately, till all the cohort was struggling and screaming
   in the dark, as if acting out the fate of Laocoön and his sons. Only
   old Scribonius Libo seemed resigned. He uttered words amidst the
   screaming, and they echo still in my ears. "Malitia vetus - malitia
   vetus est ... venit ... tandem venit ..."1

   And then I waked. It was the most vivid dream in years, drawing upon
   wells of the subconscious long untouched and forgotten. Of the fate of
   that cohort no record exists, but the town at least was saved - for
   encyclopædias tell of the survival of Pompelo to this day, under the
   modern Spanish name of Pompelona...

   8532The White ShipH. P. Lovecraft1919

   I am Basil Elton, keeper of the North Point light that my father and
   grandfather kept before me. Far from the shore stands the gray
   lighthouse, above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is
   low, but unseen when the tide is high. Past that beacon for a century
   have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas. In the days of my
   grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and
   now there are so few that I sometimes feel strangely alone, as though I
   were the last man on our planet.

   From far shores came those white-sailed argosies of old; from far
   Eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odors linger about
   strange gardens and gay temples. The old captains of the sea came often
   to my grandfather and told him of these things which in turn he told to
   my father, and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when
   the wind howled eerily from the East. And I have read more of these
   things, and of many things besides, in the books men gave me when I was
   young and filled with wonder.

   But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is
   the secret lore of ocean. Blue, green, gray, white or black; smooth,
   ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days have I
   watched it and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told to
   me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with
   the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things
   more strange and more distant in space and time. Sometimes at twilight
   the gray vapors of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the
   ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have
   grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways
   beneath. And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were
   and the ways that might be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is more
   ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the
   dreams of Time.

   Out of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon
   was full and high in the heavens. Out of the South it would glide very
   smoothly and silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or
   calm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always
   glide smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange
   tiers of oars moving rhythmically. One night I espied upon the deck a
   man, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for far
   unknown shores. Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and
   never did he beckon me.

   Very brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and
   I walked out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of
   moonbeams. The man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft
   language I seemed to know well, and the hours were filled with soft
   songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious South, golden
   with the glow of that full, mellow moon.

   And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore
   of far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown. Up from the sea
   rose lordly terraces of verdure, tree-studded, and shewing here and
   there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples. As we
   drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the
   land of Zar, where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that
   come to men once and then are forgotten. And when I looked upon the
   terraces again I saw that what he said was true, for among the sights
   before me were many things I had once seen through the mists beyond the
   horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean. There too were forms
   and fantasies more splendid than any I had ever known; the visions of
   young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they
   had seen and dreamed. But we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows
   of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to
   his native shore.

   As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of
   Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty
   city; and the bearded man said to me, "This is Thalarion, the City of a
   Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has
   striven in vain to fathom." And I looked again, at closer range, and
   saw that the city was greater than any city I had known or dreamed of
   before. Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man
   might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the
   grim, gray walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and
   ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I
   yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and
   besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge
   carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying, "Into
   Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none
   returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer
   men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who
   have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city." So the
   White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many
   days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out
   of which it had appeared.

   Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where
   as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbors
   beneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song
   and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so
   delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the
   scene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we
   approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the
   flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled.
   The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel
   odor of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we
   sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at
   last, saying, "This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained."

   So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm
   blessed seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes. Day after day and
   night after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would
   listen to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night
   when we sailed away from my far native land. And it was by moonlight
   that we anchored at last in the harbor of Sona-Nyl, which is guarded by
   twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a
   resplendent arch. This is the Land of Fancy, and we walked to the
   verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams.

   In the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither
   suffering nor death; and there I dwelt for many aeons. Green are the
   groves and pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical
   the streams, clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the
   temples, castles, and cities of Sona-Nyl. Of that land there is no
   bound, for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful.
   Over the countryside and amidst the splendor of cities can move at will
   the happy folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and
   unalloyed happiness. For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered
   blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing
   clumps of bushes, and where the white walks are bordered with delicate
   blossoms. I climbed gentle hills from whose summits I could see
   entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in
   verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities
   glittering on the infinitely distant horizon. And I viewed by moonlight
   the sparkling sea, the crystal headlands, and the placid harbor wherein
   lay anchored the White Ship.

   It was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp
   that I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt
   the first stirrings of unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and
   told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no
   man hath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars
   of the West. It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals
   of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate. But the
   bearded man said to me, "Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say
   Cathuria lies. In Sona-Nyl there is no pain or death, but who can tell
   what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West?" Natheless at the next
   full moon I boarded the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man
   left the happy harbor for untraveled seas.

   And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt
   pillars of the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under
   the full moon. In my mind I would often picture the unknown Land of
   Cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what
   new delights there awaited me. "Cathuria," I would say to myself, "is
   the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold. Its
   forests are of aloe and sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of
   Camorin, and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song. On the
   green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble,
   rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards
   cool fountains of silver, where purr with ravishing music the scented
   waters that come from the grotto-born river Narg. And the cities of
   Cathuria are cinctured with golden walls, and their pavements also are
   of gold. In the gardens of these cities are strange orchids, and
   perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber. At night the streets
   and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the
   three-colored shell of the tortoise, and here resound the soft notes of
   the singer and the lutanist. And the houses of the cities of Cathuria
   are all palaces, each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of
   the sacred Narg. Of marble and porphyry are the houses, and roofed with
   glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the
   splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant
   peaks. Fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch Dorieb, whom
   some say to be a demi-god and others a god. High is the palace of
   Dorieb, and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls. In its wide
   halls many multitudes assemble, and here hang the trophies of the ages.
   And the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure,
   and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up
   to those heights seems to gaze upon the living Olympus. And the floor
   of the palace is of glass, under which flow the cunningly lighted
   waters of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of
   lovely Cathuria."

   Thus would I speak to myself of Cathuria, but ever would the bearded
   man warn me to turn back to the happy shore of Sona-Nyl; for Sona-Nyl
   is known of men, while none hath ever beheld Cathuria.

   And on the thirty-first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the
   basalt pillars of the West. Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man
   might peer beyond them or see their summits -- which indeed some say
   reach even to the heavens. And the bearded man again implored me to
   turn back, but I heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt
   pillars I fancied there came the notes of singers and lutanists;
   sweeter than the sweetest songs of Sona-Nyl, and sounding mine own
   praises; the praises of me, who had voyaged far from the full moon and
   dwelt in the Land of Fancy. So to the sound of melody the White Ship
   sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the West. And when
   the music ceased and the mist lifted, we beheld not the Land of
   Cathuria, but a swift-rushing resistless sea, over which our helpless
   barque was borne toward some unknown goal. Soon to our ears came the
   distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes appeared on the far
   horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the
   oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness. Then did the
   bearded man say to me, with tears on his cheek, "We have rejected the
   beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never behold again. The gods
   are greater than men, and they have conquered." And I closed my eyes
   before the crash that I knew would come, shutting out the sight of the
   celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of
   the torrent.

   Out of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and
   of things which were not men. From the East tempestuous winds arose,
   and chilled me as I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen
   beneath my feet. Then as I heard another crash I opened my eyes and
   beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse whence I had sailed
   so many aeons ago. In the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred
   outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks, and as I glanced
   out over the waste I saw that the light had failed for the first time
   since my grandfather had assumed its care.

   And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I
   saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it
   at the hour I sailed away. With the dawn I descended the tower and
   looked for wreckage upon the rocks, but what I found was only this: a
   strange dead bird whose hue was as of the azure sky, and a single
   shattered spar, of a whiteness greater than that of the wave-tips or of
   the mountain snow.

   And thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many
   times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens, the White
   Ship from the South came never again.

   1336965The WoodH. P. Lovecraft

   They cut it down, and where the pitch-black aisles
         Of forest night had hid eternal things,
   They scal'd the sky with tow'rs and marble piles
         To make a city for their revellings.
   White and amazing to the lands around
         That wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose;
   Crystal and ivory, sublimely crown'd
         With pinnacles that bore unmelting snows.
   And through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang,
         While wine and riot brought their scarlet stains;
   Never a voice of elder marvels sang,
         Nor any eye call'd up the hills and plains.
   Thus down the years, till on one purple night
         A drunken minstrel in his careless verse
   Spoke the vile words that should not see the light,
         And stirr'd the shadows of an ancient curse.
   Forests may fall, but not the dusk they shield;
         So on the spot where that proud city stood,
   The shuddering dawn no single stone reveal'd,
         But fled the blackness of a primal wood.

   Lovecraft scholar Will Murray says of "Through the Gates of the Silver
   Key", "As a Dunsanian fantasy, the Price/Lovecraft collaboration is a
   failure; as a Mythos story, it is rich with ideas, but curiously
   diluted. -- Excerpted from Through the Gates of the Silver Key on

   Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley.
   Lying thus, he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion. Nothing stirred the dusty plain, the
   disintegrated sand of long-dry river-beds, where once coursed the
   gushing streams of Earth's youth. There was little greenery in this
   ultimate world, this final stage of mankind's prolonged presence upon
   the planet. For unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had ravaged
   all the lands. The trees and bushes had given way to small, twisted
   shrubs that persisted long through their sturdiness; but these, in
   turn, perished before the onslaught of coarse grasses and stringy,
   tough vegetation of strange evolution.

   The ever-present heat, as Earth drew nearer to the sun, withered and
   killed with pitiless rays. It had not come at once; long aeons had gone
   before any could feel the change. And all through those first ages
   man's adaptable form had followed the slow mutation and modelled itself
   to fit the more and more torrid air. Then the day had come when men
   could bear their hot cities but ill, and a gradual recession began,
   slow yet deliberate. Those towns and settlements closest to the equator
   had been first, of course, but later there were others. Man, softened
   and exhausted, could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat.
   It seared him as he was, and evolution was too low to mould new
   resistances in him.

   Yet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the
   spider and the scorpion. In the early years there were many who stayed
   on, devising curious shields and armours against the head and the
   deadly dryness. These fearless souls, screening certain buildings
   against the encroaching sun, made miniature worlds of refuge wherein no
   protective armour was needed. They contrived marvellously ingenious
   things, so that for a while men persisted in the rusting towers, hoping
   thereby to cling to old lands till the searing should be over. For many
   would not believe what the astronomers said, and looked for a coming of
   the mild olden world again. But one day the men of Dath, from the new
   city of Niyara, made signals to Yuanario, their immemorially ancient
   capital, and gained no answer from the few who remained therein. And
   when explorers reached that millennial city of bridge-linked towers
   they found only silence. There was not even the horror of corruption,
   for the scavenger lizards had been swift.

   Only then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to
   them; know that they must forever abandon them to nature. The other
   colonists in the hot lands fled from their brave posts, and total
   silence reigned within the high basalt walls of a thousand empty towns.
   Of the dense throngs and multitudinous activities of the past, nothing
   finally remained. There now loomed against the rainless deserts only
   the blistered towers of vacant houses, factories, and structures of
   every sort, reflecting the sun's dazzling radiance and parching in the
   more and more intolerable heat.

   Many lands, however, had still escaped the scorching blight, so that
   the refugees were soon absorbed in the life of a newer world. During
   strangely prosperous centuries the hoary deserted cities of the equator
   grew half-forgotten and entwined with fantastic fables. Few thought of
   those spectral rotting tower...those huddles of shabby walls and
   cactus-choked streets, darkly silent and abandoned...

   Wars came, sinful and prolonged, but the times of peace were greater.
   Yet always the swollen sun increased its radiance as Earth drew closer
   to its fiery parent. It was as if the planet meant to return to that
   source whence it was snatched, aeons ago, through the accidents of
   cosmic growth.

   After a time the blight crept outward from the central belt. Southern
   Yarat burned as a tenantless desert--and then the north. In Perath and
   Baling, those ancient cities where brooding centuries dwelt, there
   moved only the scaly shapes of the serpent and the salamander, and at
   last Loton echoed only to the fitful falling of tottering spires and
   crumbling domes.

   Steady, universal, and inexorable was the great eviction of man from
   the realms he had always known. No land within the widening stricken
   belt was spared; no people left unrouted. It was an epic, a titan
   tragedy whose plot was unrevealed to the actors--this wholesale
   desertion of the cities of men. It took not years or even centuries,
   but millennia of ruthless change. And still it kept on--sullen,
   inevitable, savagely devastating.

   Agriculture was at a standstill, the world fast became too arid for
   crops. This was remedied by artificial substitutes, soon universally
   used. And as the old places that had known the great things of mortals
   were left, the loot salvaged by the fugitives grew smaller and smaller.
   Things of the greatest value and importance were left in dead
   museums--lost amid the centuries--and in the end the heritage of the
   immemorial past was abandoned. A degeneracy both physical and cultural
   set in with the insidious heat. For man had so long dwelt in comfort
   and security that this exodus from past scenes was difficult. Nor were
   these events received phlegmatically; their very slowness was
   terrifying. Degradation and debauchery were soon common; government was
   disorganized, and the civilizations aimlessly slid back toward
   barbarism.

   When, forty-nine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt,
   the whole western hemisphere was left unpeopled, chaos was complete.
   There was no trace of order or decency in the last scenes of this
   titanic, wildly impressive migration. Madness and frenzy stalked
   through them, and fanatics screamed of an Armageddon close at hand.

   Mankind was now a pitiful remnant of the elder races, a fugitive not
   only from the prevailing conditions, but from his own degeneracy. Into
   the northland and the antarctic went those who could; the rest lingered
   for years in an incredible saturnalia, vaguely doubting the forthcoming
   disasters. In the city of Borligo a wholesale execution of the new
   prophets took place, after months of unfulfilled expectations. They
   thought the flight to the northland unnecessary, and looked no longer
   for the threatened ending.

   How they perished must have been terrible indeed--those vain, foolish
   creatures who thought to defy the universe. But the blackened, scorched
   towns are mute...

   These events, however, must not be chronicled--for there are larger
   things to consider than this complex and unhastening downfall of a lost
   civilization. During a long period morale was at lowest ebb among the
   courageous few who settled upon the alien arctic and antarctic shores,
   now mild as were those of southern Yarat in the long-dead past. But
   here there was respite. The soil was fertile, and forgotten pastoral
   arts were called into use anew. There was, for a long time, a contented
   little epitome of the lost lands; though here were no vast throngs or
   great buildings. Only a sparse remnant of humanity survived the aeons
   of change and peopled those scattered villages of the later world.

   How many millennia this continued is not known. The sun was slow in
   invading this last retreat; and as the eras passed there developed a
   sound, sturdy race, bearing no memories or legends of the old, lost
   lands. Little navigation was practiced by this new people, and the
   flying machine was wholly forgotten. Their devices were of the simplest
   type, and their culture was simple and primitive. Yet they were
   contented, and accepted the warm climate as something natural and
   accustomed.

   But unknown to these simple peasant-folk, still further rigours of
   nature were slowly preparing themselves. As the generations passed, the
   waters of the vast and unplumbed ocean wasted slowly away; enriching
   the air and the desiccated soil, but sinking lower and lower each
   century. The splashing surf still glistened bright, and the swirling
   eddies were still there, but a doom of dryness hung over the whole
   watery expanse. However, the shrinkage could not have been detected
   save by instruments more delicate than any then known to the race. Even
   had the people realized the ocean's contraction, it is not likely that
   any vast alarm or great disturbance would have resulted, for the losses
   were so slight, and the seas so great...Only a few inches during many
   centuries--but in many centuries; increasing--

   ***

   So at last the oceans went, and water became a rarity on a globe of
   sun-baked drought. Man had slowly spread over all the arctic and
   antarctic lands; the equatorial cities, and many of later habitation,
   were forgotten even to legend.

   And now again the peace was disturbed, for water was scarce, and found
   only in deep caverns. There was little enough, even of this; and men
   died of thirst wandering in far places. Yet so slow were these deadly
   changes, that each new generation of man was loath to believe what it
   heard from its parents. None would admit that the head had been less or
   the water more plentiful in the old days, or take warning that days of
   bitterer burning and drought were to come. Thus it was even at the end,
   when only a few hundred human creatures panted for breach beneath the
   cruel sun; a piteous huddled handful out of all the unnumbered millions
   who had once dwelt on the doomed planet.

   And the hundreds became small, till man was to be reckoned only in
   tens. These tens clung to the shrinking dampness of the caves, and knew
   at last that the end was near. So slight was their range that none had
   ever seen the tiny, fabled spots of ice left close to the planet's
   poles--if such indeed remained. Even had they existed and been known to
   man, none could have reached them across the trackless and formidable
   deserts. And so the last pathetic few dwindled...

   It cannot be described, this awesome chain of events that depopulated
   the whole Earth; the range is too tremendous for any to picture or
   encompass. Of the people of Earth's fortunate ages, billions of years
   before, only a few prophets and madmen could have conceived that which
   was to come--could have grasped visions of the still, dead lands, and
   long-empty sea-beds. The rest would have doubted...doubted alike the
   shadow of change upon the planet and the shadow of doom upon the race.
   For man has always thought himself the immortal master of natural
   things...

II.[edit]

   When he had eased the dying pangs of the old woman, Ull wandered in a
   fearful daze out into the dazzling sands. She had been a fearsome
   thing, shrivelled and so dry; like withered leaves. Her face had been
   the colour of the sickly yellow grasses that rustled in the hot wind,
   and she was loathsomely old.

   But she had been a companion; someone to stammer out vague fears to, to
   talk to about this incredible thing; a comrade to share one's hopes for
   succour from those silent other colonies beyond the mountains. He could
   not believe none lived elsewhere, for Ull was young, and not certain as
   are the old.

   For many years he had known none but the old woman--her name was
   Mladdna. She had come that day in his eleventh year, when all the
   hunters went to seek food, and did not return. Ull had no mother that
   he could remember, and there were few women in the tiny group. When the
   men vanished, those three women, the young one and the two old, had
   screamed fearfully, and moaned long. Then the young one had gone mad,
   and killed herself with a sharp stick. The old ones buried her in a
   shallow hole dug with their nails, so Ull had been alone when this
   still old Mladdna came.

   She walked with the aid of a knotty pole, a priceless relique of the
   old forests, hard and shiny with years of use. She did not say whence
   she came, but stumbled into the cabin while the young suicide was being
   buried. There she waited till the two returned, and they accepted her
   incuriously.

   That was the way it had been for many weeks, until the two fell sick,
   and Mladdna could not cure them. Strange that those younger two should
   have been stricken, while she, infirm and ancient, lived on. Mladdna
   had cared for them many days, and at length they died, so that Ull was
   left with only the stranger. He screamed all the night, so she became
   at length out of patience, and threatened to die too. Then, hearkening,
   he became quiet at once; for he was not desirous of complete solitude.
   After that he lived with Mladdna and they gathered roots to eat.

   Mladdna's rotten teeth were ill suited to the food they gathered, but
   they contrived to chop it up till she could manage it. This weary
   routine of seeking and eating was Ull's childhood.

   Now he was strong, and firm, in his nineteenth year, and the old woman
   was dead. There was naught to stay for, so he determined at once to
   seek out those fabled huts beyond the mountains, and live with the
   people there. There was nothing to take on the journey. Ull closed the
   door of his cabin--why, he could not have told, for no animals had been
   there for many years--and left the dead woman within. Half-dazed, and
   fearful at his own audacity, he walked long hours in the dry grasses,
   and at length reached the first of the foothills. The afternoon came,
   and he climbed until he was weary, and lay down on the grasses.
   Sprawled there, he thought of many things. He wondered at the strange
   life, passionately anxious to seek out the lost colony beyond the
   mountains; but at last he slept.

   When he awoke there was starlight on his face, and he felt refreshed.
   Now that the sun was gone for a time, he travelled more quickly, eating
   little, and determining to hasten before the lack of water became
   difficult to bear. He had brought none; for the last people, dwelling
   in one place and never having occasion to bear their precious water
   away, made no vessels of any kind. Ull hoped to reach his goal within a
   day, and thus escape thirst; so he hurried on beneath the bright stars,
   running at times in the ear air, and at other times lapsing into a
   dogtrot.

   So he continued until the sun arose, yet still he was within the small
   hills, with three great peaks looming ahead. In their shade he rested
   again. Then he climbed all the morning, and at mid-day surmounted the
   first peak, where he lay for a time, surveying the space before the
   next range.

   Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley.
   Lying thus he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion...

   The second night came, and found Ull amid the rough peaks, the valley
   and the place where he had rested far behind. He was nearly out of the
   second range now, and hurrying still. Thirst had come upon him that
   day, and he regretted his folly. Yet he could not have stayed there
   with the corpse, alone in the grasslands. He sought to convince himself
   thus, and hastened ever on, tiredly straining.

   And now there were only a few steps before the cliff wall would part
   and allow a view of the land beyond. Ull stumbled wearily down the
   stony way, tumbling and bruising himself even more. It was nearly
   before him, this land where men were rumoured to have dwelt; this land
   of which he had heard tales in his youth. The way was long, but the
   goal was great. A boulder of giant circumference cut off his view; upon
   this he scrambled anxiously. Now at last he could behold by the sinking
   orb his long-sought destination, and his thirst and aching muscles were
   forgotten as he saw joyfully that a small huddle of buildings clung to
   the base of the farther cliff.

   Ull rested not; but, spurred on by what he saw, ran and staggered and
   crawled the half mile remaining. He fancied that he could detect forms
   among the rude cabins. The sun was nearly gone; the hateful,
   devastating sun that had slain humanity. He could not be sure of
   details, but soon the cabins were near.

   They were very old, for clay blocks lasted long in the still dryness of
   the dying world. Little, indeed, changed but the living things--the
   grasses and these last men.

   Before him an open door swung on rude pegs. In the fading light Ull
   entered, weary unto death, seeking painfully the expected faces.

   Then he fell upon the floor and wept, for at the table was propped a
   dry and ancient skeleton.

   ***

   He rose at last, crazed by thirst, aching unbearably, and suffering the
   greatest disappointment any mortal could know. He was, then, the last
   living thing upon the globe. His the heritage of the Earth...all the
   lands, and all to him equally useless. He staggered up, not looking at
   the dim white form in the reflected moonlight, and went through the
   door. About the empty village he wandered, spectrally preserved by the
   changeless air. Here there was a dwelling, there a rude place where
   things had been made--clay vessels holding only dust, and nowhere any
   liquid to quench his burning thirst.

   Then, in the centre of the little town, Ull saw a well-curb. He knew
   what it was, for he had heard tales of such things from Mladdna. With
   pitiful joy, he reeled forward and leaned upon the edge. There, at
   last, was the end of his search. Water--slimy, stagnant, and shallow,
   but water--before his sight.

   Ull cried out in the voice of a tortured animal, groping for the chain
   and bucket. His hand slipped on the slimy edge; and he fell upon his
   chest across the bring. For a moment he lay there--then soundlessly his
   body was precipitated down the black shaft.

   There was a slight splash in the murky shallowness as he struck some
   long-sunken stone, dislodged aeons ago from the massive coping. The
   disturbed water subsided into quietness.

   And now at last the Earth was dead. The final pitiful survivor had
   perished. All the teeming billions; the slow aeons; the empires and
   civilizations of mankind were summed up in this poor twisted form--and
   how titanically meaningless it had all been! Now indeed had come and
   end and climax to all the efforts of humanity--how monstrous and
   incredible a climax in the eyes of those poor complacent fools in the
   prosperous days! Not ever again would the planet know the thunderous
   tramping of human millions--or even the crawling of lizards and the
   buzz of insects, for they, too, had gone. Now was come the reign of
   sapless branches and endless fields of tough grasses. Earth, like its
   cold, imperturbable moon, was given over to silence and blackness
   forever.

   The stars whirled on; the whole careless plan would continue for
   infinities unknown. This trivial end of a negligible episode mattered
   not to distant nebulae or to suns new-born, flourishing, and dying. The
   race of man, too puny and momentary to have a real function or purpose,
   was as if it had never existed. To such a conclusion the aeons of its
   farcically toilsome evolution had led.

   But when the deadly sun's first rays darted across the valley, a light
   found its way to the weary face of a broken figure that lay in the
   slime.

   Pictures, and SculpturesH.P. Lovecraft

   A time-black tower against dim banks of cloud;
         Around its base the pathless, pressing wood.
   Shadow and silence, moss and mould, enshroud
         Grey, age-fell'd slabs that once as cromlechs stood.
   No fall of foot, no song of bird awakes
         The lethal aisles of sempiternal night,
   Tho' oft with stir of wings the dense air shakes,
         As in the tower there glows a pallid light.
   For here, apart, dwells one whose hands have wrought
         Strange eidola that chill the world with fear;
   Whose graven runes in tones of dread have taught
         What things beyond the star-gulfs lurk and leer.
   Dark Lord of Averoigne--whose windows stare
   On pits of dream no other gaze could bear!

   12316To Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Eighteenth Baron of
   DunsanyH. P. Lovecraft

   As when the sun above a dusky wold,
   Springs into sight and turns the gloom to gold,
   Lights with his magic beams the dew-deck'd bow'r,
   And wakes to life the gay responsive flow'r;
   So now o'er realms where dark'ning dulness lies,
   In solar state see shining PLUNKETT rise!
   Monarch of Fancy! whose ethereal mind
   Mounts fairy peaks, and leaves the throng behind;
   Whose soul untainted bursts the bounds of space,
   And leads to regions of supernal grace:
   Can any praise thee with too strong a tone,
   Who in this age of folly gleam'd alone?
   Thy quill, DUNSANY, with an art divine
   Recalls the gods to each deserted shrine;
   From mystic air a novel pantheon makes,
   And with new spirits fills the meads and brakes;
   With thee we wander thro' primeval bow'rs,
   For thou hast brought earth's childhood back, and ours!
   How leaps the soul, with sudden bliss increas'd,
   When led by thee to lands beyond the East!
   Sick of this sphere, in crime and conflict old,
   We yearn for wonders distant and untold;
   O'er Homer's page a second time we pore,
   And rack our brains for gleams of infant lore:
   But all in vain--for valiant tho' we strive
   No common means these pictures can revive.
   Then dawns DUNSANY with celestial light
   And fulgent visions break upon our sight:
   His barque enchanted each sad spirit bears
   To shores of gold, beyond the reach of cares.
   No earthly trammels now our thoughts may chain;
   For childhood's fancy hath come back again!
   What glitt'ring worlds now wait our eager eyes!
   What roads untrodden beckon thro' the skies!
   Wonders on wonders line the gorgeous ways,
   And glorious vistas greet the ravish'd gaze;
   Mountains of clouds, castles of crystal dreams,
   Ethereal cities and Elysian streams;
   Temples of blue, where myriad stars adore
   Forgotten gods of aeons gone before!
   Such are thine arts, DUNSANY, such thy skill,
   That scarce terrestrial seems thy moving quill;
   Can man, and man alone, successful draw
   Such scenes of wonder and domains of awe?
   Our hearts, enraptur'd, fix thy mind's abode
   In high PEGANA: hail thee as a god;
   And sure, can aught more high or godlike be
   Than such a fancy as resides in thee?
   Delighted Pan a friend and peer perceives
   As thy sweet music stirs the sylvan leaves;
   The Nine, transported, bless thy golden lyre:
   Approve thy fancy, and applaud thy fire;
   Whilst Jove himself assumes a brother's tone,
   And vows the pantheon equal to his own.
   DUNSANY, may thy days be glad and long;
   Replete with visions, and atune with song;
   May thy rare notes increasing millions cheer,
   Thy name beloved, and thy mem'ry dear!
   'Tis thou who hast in hours of dulness brought
   New charms of language, and new gems of thought;
   Hast with a poet's grace enrich'd the earth
   With aureate dreams as noble as thy birth.
   Grateful we name thee, bright with fix'd renown,
   The fairest jewel in HIBERNIA'S crown.

   Dead Passion's Flame

   A Pome by Blank Frailty

   Ah, Passion, like a voice - that buds!
   With many thorns...that sharply stick:
   Recalls to me the longing of our bloods...
   And - makes my wearied heart requick! ...

   Arcadia

   By Head Balledup

   O give me the life of the Village,
       Uninhibited, free, and sweet.
   The place where the arts all flourish,
       Grove Court and Christopher Street.

   I am sick of the old conventions,
       And critics who will not praise,
   So sing ho for the open spaces,
       And aesthetes with kindly ways.

   Here every bard is a genius,
       And artists are Raphaels,
   And above the roofs of Patchin Place
       The Muse of Talent dwells.

   1364043Two Black BottlesH. P. Lovecraft and Wilfred Blanch Talman1926

   Not all of the few remaining inhabitants of Daalbergen, that dismal
   little village in the Ramapo Mountains, believe that my uncle, old
   Dominie Vanderhoof, is really dead. Some of them believe he is
   suspended somewhere between heaven and hell because of the old sexton's
   curse. If it had not been for that old magician, he might still be
   preaching in the little damp church across the moor. After what has
   happened to me in Daalbergen, I can almost share the opinion of the
   villagers. I am not sure that my uncle is dead, but I am very sure that
   he is not alive upon this earth. There is no doubt that the old sexton
   buried him once, but he is not in that grave now. I can almost feel him
   behind me as I write, impelling me to tell the truth about those
   strange happenings in Daalbergen so many years ago. It was the fourth
   day of October when I arrived at Daalbergen in answer to a summons. The
   letter was from a former member of my uncle's congregation, who wrote
   that the old man had passed away and that there should be some small
   estate which I, as his only living relative, might inherit. Having
   reached the secluded little hamlet by a wearying series of changes on
   branch railways, I found my way to the grocery store of Mark Haines,
   writer of the letter, and he, leading me into a stuffy back room, told
   me a peculiar tale concerning Dominie Vanderhoof's death. "Y' should be
   careful, Hoffman," Haines told me, "when y' meet that old sexton, Abel
   Foster. He's in league with the devil, sure's you're alive. 'Twa'n't
   two weeks ago Sam Pryor, when he passed the old graveyard, heared him
   mumblin 't' the dead there. 'Twa'n't right he should talk that way--an'
   Sam does vow that there was a voice answered him--a kind o' half-voice,
   hollow and muffled-like, as though it come out o' th' ground. There's
   others, too, as could tell y' about seein' him standin' afore old
   Dominie Slott's grave--that one right agin' the church wall--a-wringin'
   his hands an' a-talkin' t' th' moss on th' tombstone as though it was
   the old Dominie himself." Old Foster, Haines said, had come to
   Daalbergen about ten years before, and had been immediately engaged by
   Vanderhoof to take care of the damp stone church at which most of the
   villagers worshipped. No one but Vanderhoof seemed to like him, for his
   presence brought a suggestion almost of the uncanny. He would sometimes
   stand by the door when the people came to church, and the men would
   coldly return his servile bow while the women brushed past in haste,
   holding their skirts aside to avoid touching him. He could be seen on
   week days cutting the grass in the cemetery and tending the flowers
   around the graves, now and then crooning and muttering to himself. And
   few failed to notice the particular attention he paid to the grave of
   the Reverend Guilliam Slott, first pastor of the church in 1701. It was
   not long after Foster's establishment as a village fixture that
   disaster began to lower. First came the failure of the mountain mine
   where most of the men worked. The vein of iron had given out, and many
   of the people moved away to better localities, while those who had
   large holdings of land in the vicinity took to farming and managed to
   wrest a meager living from the rocky hillsides. Then came the
   disturbances in the church. It was whispered about that the Reverend
   Johannes Vanderhoof had made a compact with the devil, and was
   preaching his word in the house of God. His sermons had become weird
   and grotesque--redolent with sinister things which the ignorant people
   of Daalbergen did not understand. He transported them back over ages of
   fear and superstition to regions of hideous, unseen spirits, and
   peopled their fancy with night-haunting ghouls. One by one the
   congregation dwindled, while the elders and deacons vainly pleaded with
   Vanderhoof to change the subject of his sermons. Though the old man
   continually promised to comply, he seemed to be enthralled by some
   higher power which forced him to do its will. A giant in stature,
   Johannes Vanderhoof was known to be weak and timid at heart, yet even
   when threatened with expulsion he continued his eerie sermons, until
   scarcely a handful of people remained to listen to him on Sunday
   morning. Because of weak finances, it was found impossible to call a
   new pastor, and before long not one of the villagers dared venture near
   the church or the parsonage which adjoined it. Everywhere there was
   fear of those spectral wraiths with whom Vanderhoof was apparently in
   league. My uncle, Mark Haines told me, had continued to live in the
   parsonage because there was no one with sufficient courage to tell him
   to move out of it. No one ever saw him again, but lights were visible
   in the parsonage at night, and were even glimpsed in the church from
   time to time. It was whispered about the town that Vanderhoof preached
   regularly in the church every Sunday morning, unaware that his
   congregation was no longer there to listen. He had only the old sexton,
   who lived in the basement of the church, to take care of him, and
   Foster made a weekly visit to what remained of the business section of
   the village to buy provisions. He no longer bowed servilely to everyone
   he met, but instead seemed to harbor a demoniac and ill-concealed
   hatred. He spoke to no one except as was necessary to make his
   purchases, and glanced from left to right out of evil-filled eyes as he
   walked the street with his cane tapping the uneven pavements. Bent and
   shriveled with extreme age, his presence could actually be felt by
   anyone near him, so powerful was that personality which, said the
   townspeople, had made Vanderhoof accept the devil as his master. No
   person in Daalbergen doubted that Abel Foster was at the bottom of all
   the town's ill luck, but not a one dared lift a finger against him, or
   could even approach him without a tremor of fear. His name, as well as
   Vanderhoof's, was never mentioned aloud. Whenever the matter of the
   church across the moor was discussed, it was in whispers; and if the
   conversation chanced to be nocturnal, the whisperers would keep
   glancing over their shoulders to make sure that nothing shapeless or
   sinister crept out of the darkness to bear witness to their words. The
   churchyard continued to be kept just as green and beautiful as when the
   church was in use, and the flowers near the graves in the cemetery were
   tended just as carefully as in times gone by. The old sexton could
   occasionally be seen working there, as if still being paid for his
   services, and those who dared venture near said that he maintained a
   continual conversation with the devil and with those spirits which
   lurked within the graveyard walls. One morning, Haines went on to say,
   Foster was seen digging a grave where the steeple of the church throws
   its shadow in the afternoon, before the sun goes down behind the
   mountain and puts the entire village in semi-twilight. Later, the
   church bell, silent for months, tolled solemnly for a half-hour. And at
   sundown those who were watching from a distance saw Foster bring a
   coffin from the parsonage on a wheelbarrow, dump it into the grave with
   slender ceremony, and replace the earth in the hole. The sexton came to
   the village the next morning, ahead of his usual weekly schedule, and
   in much better spirits than was customary. He seemed willing to talk,
   remarking that Vanderhoof had died the day before, and that he had
   buried his body beside that of Dominie Slott near the church wall. He
   smiled from time to time, and rubbed his hands in an untimely and
   unaccountable glee. It was apparent that he took a perverse and
   diabolic delight in Vanderhoof's death. The villagers were conscious of
   an added uncanniness in his presence, and avoided him as much as they
   could. With Vanderhoof gone they felt more insecure than ever, for the
   old sexton was now free to cast his worst spells over the town from the
   church across the moor. Muttering something in a tongue which no one
   understood, Foster made his way back along the road over the swamp. It
   was then, it seems, that Mark Haines remembered having heard Dominie
   Vanderhoof speak of me as his nephew. Haines accordingly sent for me,
   in the hope that I might know something which would clear up the
   mystery of my uncle's last years. I assured my summoner, however, that
   I knew nothing about my uncle or his past, except that my mother had
   mentioned him as a man of gigantic physique but with little courage or
   power of will. Having heard all that Haines had to tell me, I lowered
   the front legs of my chair to the floor and looked at my watch. It was
   late afternoon. "How far is it out to the church?" I inquired. "Think I
   can make it before sunset?" "Sure, lad, y' ain't goin' out there
   t'night! Not t' that place!" The old man trembled noticeably in every
   limb and half rose from his chair, stretching out a lean, detaining
   hand. "Why, it's plumb foolishness!" he exclaimed. I laughed aside his
   fears and informed him that, come what may, I was determined to see the
   old sexton that evening and get the whole matter over as soon as
   possible. I did not intend to accept the superstitions of ignorant
   country folk as truth, for I was convinced that all I had just heard
   was merely a chain of events which the over-imaginative people of
   Daalbergen had happened to link with their ill-luck. I felt no sense of
   fear or horror whatever. Seeing that I was determined to reach my
   uncle's house before nightfall, Haines ushered me out of his office and
   reluctantly gave me the few required directions, pleading from time to
   time that I change my mind. He shook my hand when I left, as though he
   never expected to see me again. "Take keer that old devil, Foster,
   don't git ye!" he warned, again and again. "I wouldn't go near him
   after dark fer love n'r money. No siree!" He re-entered his store,
   solemnly shaking his head, while I set out along a road leading to the
   outskirts of the town. I had walked barely two minutes before I sighted
   the moor of which Haines had spoken. The road, flanked by a whitewashed
   fence, passed over the great swamp, which was overgrown with clumps of
   underbrush dipping down into the dank, slimy ooze. An odor of deadness
   and decay filled the air, and even in the sunlit afternoon little wisps
   of vapor could be seen rising from the unhealthful spot. On the
   opposite side of the moor I turned sharply to the left, as I had been
   directed, branching from the main road. There were several houses in
   the vicinity, I noticed; houses which were scarcely more than huts,
   reflecting the extreme poverty of their owners. The road here passed
   under the drooping branches of enormous willows which almost completely
   shut out the rays of the sun. The miasmal odor of the swamp was still
   in my nostrils, and the air was damp and chilly. I hurried my pace to
   get out of that dismal tunnel as soon as possible. Presently I found
   myself in the light again. The sun, now hanging like a red ball upon
   the crest of the mountain, was beginning to dip low, and there, some
   distance ahead of me, bathed in its bloody iridescence, stood the
   lonely church. I began to sense that uncanniness which Haines had
   mentioned; that feeling of dread which made all Daalbergen shun the
   place. The squat, stone hulk of the church itself, with its blunt
   steeple, seemed like an idol to which the tombstones that surrounded it
   bowed down and worshipped, each with an arched top like the shoulders
   of a kneeling person, while over the whole assemblage the dingy, gray
   parsonage hovered like a wraith. I had slowed my pace a trifle as I
   took in the scene. The sun was disappearing behind the mountain very
   rapidly now, and the damp air chilled me. Turning my coat collar up
   about my neck, I plodded on. Something caught my eye as I glanced up
   again. In the shadow of the church wall was something white--a thing
   which seemed to have no definite shape. Straining my eyes as I came
   nearer, I saw that it was a cross of new timber, surmounting a mound of
   freshly turned earth. The discovery sent a new chill through me. I
   realized that this must be my uncle's grave, but something told me that
   it was not like the other graves near it. It did not seem like a dead
   grave. In some intangible way it appeared to be living, if a grave can
   be said to live. Very close to it, I saw as I came nearer, was another
   grave; an old mound with a crumbling stone about it. Dominie Slott's
   tomb, I thought, remembering Haines's story. There was no sign of life
   anywhere about the place. In the semi-twilight I climbed the low knoll
   upon which the parsonage stood, and hammered upon the door. There was
   no answer. I skirted the house and peered into the windows. The whole
   place seemed deserted. The lowering mountains had made night fall with
   disarming suddenness the minute the sun was fully hidden. I realized
   that I could see scarcely more than a few feet ahead of me. Feeling my
   way carefully, I rounded a corner of the house and paused, wondering
   what to do next. Everything was quiet. There was not a breath of wind,
   nor were there even the usual noises made by animals in their nocturnal
   ramblings. All dread had been forgotten for a time, but in the presence
   of that sepulchral calm my apprehensions returned. I imagined the air
   peopled with ghastly spirits that pressed around me, making the air
   almost unbreathable. I wondered, for the hundredth time, where the old
   sexton might be. As I stood there, half expecting some sinister demon
   to creep from the shadows, I noticed two lighted windows glaring from
   the belfry of the church. I then remembered what Haines had told me
   about Foster's living in the basement of the building. Advancing
   cautiously through the blackness, I found a side door of the church
   ajar. The interior had a musty and mildewed odor. Everything I touched
   was covered with a cold, clammy moisture. I struck a match and began to
   explore, to discover, if I could, how to get into the belfry. Suddenly
   I stopped in my tracks. A snatch of song, loud and obscene, sung in a
   voice that was guttural and thick with drink, came from above me. The
   match burned my fingers, and I dropped it. Two pin-points of light
   pierced the darkness of the farther wall of the church, and below them,
   to one side, I could see a door outlined where light filtered through
   its cracks. The song stopped as abruptly as it had commenced, and there
   was absolute silence again. My heart was thumping and blood racing
   through my temples. Had I not been petrified with fear, I should have
   fled immediately. Not caring to light another match, I felt my way
   among the pews until I stood in front of the door. So deep was the
   feeling of depression which had come over me that I felt as though I
   were acting in a dream. My actions were almost involuntary. The door
   was locked, as I found when I turned the knob. I hammered upon it for
   some time, but there was no answer. The silence was as complete as
   before. Feeling around the edge of the door, I found the hinges,
   removed the pins from them, and allowed the door to fall toward me. Dim
   light flooded down a steep flight of steps. There was a sickening odor
   of whisky. I could now hear someone stirring in the belfry room above.
   Venturing a low halloo, I thought I heard a groan in reply, and
   cautiously climbed the stairs. My first glance into that unhallowed
   place was indeed startling. Strewn about the little room were old and
   dusty books and manuscripts--strange things that bespoke almost
   unbelievable age. On rows of shelves which reached to the ceiling were
   horrible things in glass jars and bottles--snakes and lizards and bats.
   Dust and mold and cobwebs encrusted everything. In the center, behind a
   table upon which was a lighted candle, a nearly empty bottle of whisky,
   and a glass, was a motionless figure with a thin, scrawny, wrinkled
   face and wild eyes that stared blankly through me. I recognized Abel
   Foster, the old sexton, in an instant. He did not move or speak as I
   came slowly and fearfully toward him. "Mr. Foster?" I asked, trembling
   with unaccountable fear when I heard my voice echo within the close
   confines of the room. There was no reply, and no movement from the
   figure behind the table. I wondered if he had not drunk himself to
   insensibility, and went behind the table to shake him. At the mere
   touch of my arm upon his shoulder, the strange old man started from his
   chair as though terrified. His eyes, still having in them that same
   blank stare, were fixed upon me. Swinging his arms like flails, he
   backed away. "Don't!" he screamed. "Don't touch me! Go back--go back!"
   I saw that he was both drunk and struck with some kind of a nameless
   terror. Using a soothing tone, I told him who I was and why I had come.
   He seemed to understand vaguely and sank back into his chair, sitting
   limp and motionless. "I thought ye was him," he mumbled. "I thought ye
   was him come back fer it. He's been a-tryin' t' get out--a-tryin' t'
   get out sence I put him in there." His voice again rose to a scream and
   he clutched his chair. "Maybe he's got out now! Maybe he's out!" I
   looked about, half expecting to see some spectral shape coming up the
   stairs. "Maybe who's out?" I inquired. "Vanderhoof!" he shrieked. "Th'
   cross over his grave keeps fallin' down in th' night! Every morning the
   earth is loose, and gets harder t' pat down. He'll come out an' I won't
   be able t' do nothin'." Forcing him back into the chair, I seated
   myself on a box near him. He was trembling in mortal terror, with the
   saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth. From time to time I felt
   that sense of horror which Haines had described when he told me of the
   old sexton. Truly, there was something uncanny about the man. His head
   had now sunk forward upon his breast, and he seemed calmer, mumbling to
   himself. I quietly arose and opened a window to let out the fumes of
   whisky and the musty odor of dead things. Light from a dim moon, just
   risen, made objects below barely visible. I could just see Dominie
   Vanderhoof's grave from my position in the belfry, and blinked my eyes
   as I gazed at it. That cross was tilted! I remembered that it had been
   vertical an hour ago. Fear took possession of me again. I turned
   quickly. Foster sat in his chair watching me. His glance was saner than
   before. "So ye're Vanderhoof's nephew," he mumbled in a nasal tone.
   "Waal, ye might's well know it all. He'll be back after me afore long,
   he will--jus' as soon as he can get out o' that there grave. Ye might's
   well know all about it now." His terror appeared to have left him. He
   seemed resigned to some horrible fate which he expected any minute. His
   head dropped down upon his chest again, and he went on muttering in
   that nasal monotone. "Ye see all them there books and papers? Waal,
   they was once Dominie Slott's--Dominie Slott, who was here years ago.
   All them things is got t' do with magic--black magic that th' old
   Dominie knew afore he come t' this country. They used t' burn 'em an'
   boil 'em in oil fer knowin' that over there, they did. But old Slott
   knew, and he didn't go fer t' tell nobody. No sir, old Slott used to
   preach here generations ago, an' he used to come up here an' study them
   books, an' use all them dead things in jars, an' pronounce magic curses
   an' things, but he didn't let nobody know it. No, nobody knowed it but
   Dominie Slott an' me." "You?" I ejaculated, leaning across the table
   toward him. "That is, me after I learned it." His face showed lines of
   trickery as he answered me. "I found all this stuff here when I come t'
   be church sexton, an' I used t' read it when I wa'n't at work. An' I
   soon got t' know all about it." The old man droned on, while I
   listened, spellbound. He told about learning the difficult formulae of
   demonology, so that, by means of incantations, he could cast spells
   over human beings. He had performed horrible occult rites of his
   hellish creed, calling down anathema upon the town and its inhabitants.
   Crazed by his desires, he tried to bring the church under his spell,
   but the power of God was too strong. Finding Johannes Vanderhoof very
   weak-willed, he bewitched him so that he preached strange and mystic
   sermons which struck fear into the simple hearts of the country folk.
   From his position in the belfry room, he said, behind a painting of the
   temptation of Christ which adorned the rear wall of the church, he
   would glare at Vanderhoof while he was preaching, through holes which
   were the eyes of the Devil in the picture. Terrified by the uncanny
   things which were happening in their midst, the congregation left one
   by one, and Foster was able to do what he pleased with the church and
   with Vanderhoof. "But what did you do with him?" I asked in a hollow
   voice as the old sexton paused in his confession. He burst into a
   cackle of laughter, throwing back his head in drunken glee. "I took his
   soul!" he howled in a tone that set me trembling. "I took his soul and
   put it in a bottle--in a little black bottle! And I buried him! But he
   ain't got his soul, an' he cain't go neither t' heaven n'r hell! But
   he's a-comin' back after it. He's a-trying' t' get out o' his grave
   now. I can hear him pushin' his way up through the ground, he's that
   strong!" As the old man had proceeded with his story, I had become more
   and more convinced that he must be telling me the truth, and not merely
   gibbering in drunkenness. Every detail fitted what Haines had told me.
   Fear was growing upon me by degrees. With the old wizard now shouting
   with demoniac laughter, I was tempted to bolt down the narrow stairway
   and leave that accursed neighborhood. To calm myself, I rose and again
   looked out of the window. My eyes nearly started from their sockets
   when I saw that the cross above Vanderhoof's grave had fallen
   perceptibly since I had last looked at it. It was now tilted to an
   angle of forty-five degrees! "Can't we dig up Vanderhoof and restore
   his soul?" I asked almost breathlessly, feeling that something must be
   done in a hurry. The old man rose from his chair in terror. "No, no,
   no!" he screamed. "He'd kill me! I've fergot th' formula, an' if he
   gets out he'll be alive, without a soul. He'd kill us both!" "Where is
   the bottle that contains his soul?" I asked, advancing threateningly
   toward him. I felt that some ghastly thing was about to happen, which I
   must do all in my power to prevent. "I won't tell ye, ye young whelp!"
   he snarled. I felt, rather than saw, a queer light in his eyes as he
   backed into a corner. "An' don't ye touch me, either, or ye'll wish ye
   hadn't!" I moved a step forward, noticing that on a low stool behind
   him there were two black bottles. Foster muttered some peculiar words
   in a low singsong voice. Everything began to turn gray before my eyes,
   and something within me seemed to be dragged upward, trying to get out
   at my throat. I felt my knees become weak. Lurching forward, I caught
   the old sexton by the throat, and with my free arm reached for the
   bottles on the stool. But the old man fell backward, striking the stool
   with his foot, and one bottle fell to the floor as I snatched the
   other. There was a flash of blue flame, and a sulfurous smell filled
   the room. From the little heap of broken glass a white vapor rose and
   followed the draft out the window. "Curse ye, ye rascal!" sounded a
   voice that seemed faint and far away. Foster, whom I had released when
   the bottle broke, was crouching against the wall, looking smaller and
   more shriveled than before. His face was slowly turning greenish-black.
   "Curse ye!" said the voice again, hardly sounding as though it came
   from his lips. "I'm done fer! That one in there was mine! Dominie Slott
   took it out two hundred years ago!" He slid slowly toward the floor,
   gazing at me with hatred in eyes that were rapidly dimming. His flesh
   changed from white to black, and then to yellow. I saw with horror that
   his body seemed to be crumbling away and his clothing falling into limp
   folds. The bottle in my hand was growing warm. I glanced at it,
   fearfully. It glowed with a faint phosphorescence. Stiff with fright, I
   set it upon the table, but could not keep my eyes from it. There was an
   ominous moment of silence as its glow became brighter, and then there
   came distinctly to my ears the sound of sliding earth. Gasping for
   breath, I looked out of the window. The moon was now well up in the
   sky, and by its light I could see that the fresh cross above
   Vanderhoof's grave had completely fallen. Once again there came the
   sound of trickling gravel, and no longer able to control myself, I
   stumbled down the stairs and found my way out of doors. Falling now and
   then as I raced over the uneven ground, I ran on in abject terror. When
   I had reached the foot of the knoll, at the entrance to that gloomy
   tunnel beneath the willows, I heard a horrible roar behind me. Turning,
   I glanced back toward the church. Its wall reflected the light of the
   moon, and silhouetted against it was a gigantic, loathsome, black
   shadow climbing from my uncle's grave and floundering gruesomely toward
   the church. I told my story to a group of villagers in Haines's store
   the next morning. They looked from one to the other with little smiles
   during my tale, I noticed, but when I suggested that they accompany me
   to the spot, gave various excuses for not caring to go. Though there
   seemed to be a limit to their credulity, they cared to run no risks. I
   informed them that I would go alone, though I must confess that the
   project did not appeal to me. As I left the store, one old man with a
   long, white beard hurried after me and caught my arm. "I'll go wi' ye,
   lad," he said. "It do seem that I once heared my gran'pap tell o'
   su'thin' o' the sort concernin' old Dominie Slott. A queer old man I've
   heared he were, but Vanderhoof's been worse." Dominie Vanderhoof's
   grave was open and deserted when we arrived. Of course it could have
   been grave-robbers, the two of us agreed, and yet. . . . In the belfry
   the bottle which I had left upon the table was gone, though the
   fragments of the broken one were found on the floor. And upon the heap
   of yellow dust and crumpled clothing that had once been Abel Foster
   were certain immense footprints. After glancing at some of the books
   and papers strewn about the belfry room, we carried them down the
   stairs and burned them, as something unclean and unholy. With a spade
   which we found in the church basement we filled in the grave of
   Johannes Vanderhoof, and, as an afterthought, flung the fallen cross
   upon the flames. Old wives say that now, when the moon is full, there
   walks about the churchyard a gigantic and bewildered figure clutching a
   bottle and seeking some unremembered goal.

   Mystery attracts mystery. Ever since the wide appearance of my name as
   a performer of unexplained feats, I have encountered strange narratives
   and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests
   and activities. Some of these have been trivial and irrelevant, some
   deeply dramatic and absorbing, some productive of weird and perilous
   experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and
   historical research. Many of these matters I have told and shall
   continue to tell very freely; but there is one of which I speak with
   great reluctance, and which I am now relating only after a session of
   grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine, who had heard
   vague rumors of it from other members of my family.

   The hitherto guarded subject pertains to my non-professional visit to
   Egypt fourteen years ago, and has been avoided by me for several
   reasons. For one thing, I am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably
   actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists
   who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much
   diligence by the authorities at Cairo, who cannot be wholly ignorant of
   them. For another thing, I dislike to recount an incident in which my
   own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part. What I
   saw--or thought I saw--certainly did not take place; but is rather to
   be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in Egyptology, and of
   the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally
   prompted. These imaginative stimuli, magnified by the excitement of an
   actual event terrible enough in itself, undoubtedly gave rise to the
   culminating horror of that grotesque night so long past.

   In January, 1910, I had finished a professional engagement in England
   and signed a contract for a tour of Australian theatres. A liberal time
   being allowed for the trip, I determined to make the most of it in the
   sort of travel which chiefly interests me; so accompanied by my wife I
   drifted pleasantly down the Continent and embarked at Marseilles on the
   P & O Steamer Malwa, bound for Port Said. From that point I proposed to
   visit the principal historical localities of lower Egypt before leaving
   finally for Australia.

   The voyage was an agreeable one, and enlivened by many of the amusing
   incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work. I had
   intended, for the sake of quiet travel, to keep my name a secret; but
   was goaded into betraying myself by a fellow-magician whose anxiety to
   astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and
   exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito. I
   mention this because of its ultimate effect--an effect I should have
   foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter
   throughout the Nile valley. What it did was to herald my identity
   wherever I subsequently went, and deprive my wife and me of all the
   placid inconspicuousness we had sought. Traveling to seek curiosities,
   I was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself!

   We had come to Egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically
   impressive, but found little enough when the ship edged up to Port Said
   and discharged its passengers in small boats. Low dunes of sand,
   bobbing buoys in shallow water, and a drearily European small town with
   nothing of interest save the great De Lesseps statue, made us anxious
   to get to something more worth our while. After some discussion we
   decided to proceed at once to Cairo and the Pyramids, later going to
   Alexandria for the Australian boat and for whatever Greco-Roman sights
   that ancient metropolis might present.

   The railway journey was tolerable enough, and consumed only four hours
   and a half. We saw much of the Suez Canal, whose route we followed as
   far as Ismailiya and later had a taste of Old Egypt in our glimpse of
   the restored fresh-water canal of the Middle Empire. Then at last we
   saw Cairo glimmering through the growing dusk; a winkling constellation
   which became a blaze as we halted at the great Gare Centrale.

   But once more disappointment awaited us, for all that we beheld was
   European save the costumes and the crowds. A prosaic subway led to a
   square teeming with carriages, taxicabs, and trolley-cars and gorgeous
   with electric lights shining on tall buildings; whilst the very theatre
   where I was vainly requested to play and which I later attended as a
   spectator, had recently been renamed the 'American Cosmograph'. We
   stopped at Shepheard's Hotel, reached in a taxi that sped along broad,
   smartly built-up streets; and amidst the perfect service of its
   restaurant, elevators and generally Anglo-American luxuries the
   mysterious East and immemorial past seemed very far away.

   The next day, however, precipitated us delightfully into the heart of
   the Arabian Nights atmosphere; and in the winding ways and exotic
   skyline of Cairo, the Bagdad of Harun-al-Rashid seemed to live again.
   Guided by our Baedeker, we had struck east past the Ezbekiyeh Gardens
   along the Mouski in quest of the native quarter, and were soon in the
   hands of a clamorous cicerone who--notwithstanding later
   developments--was assuredly a master at his trade.

   Not until afterward did I see that I should have applied at the hotel
   for a licensed guide. This man, a shaven, peculiarly hollow-voiced and
   relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a Pharaoh and called himself
   'Abdul Reis el Drogman' appeared to have much power over others of his
   kind; though subsequently the police professed not to know him, and to
   suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority, whilst
   'Drogman' is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word
   for a leader of tourist parties--dragoman.

   Abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed
   of. Old Cairo is itself a story-book and a dream--labyrinths of narrow
   alleys redolent of aromatic secrets; Arabesque balconies and oriels
   nearly meeting above the cobbled streets; maelstroms of Oriental
   traffic with strange cries, cracking whips, rattling carts, jingling
   money, and braying donkeys; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes, veils,
   turbans, and tarbushes; water-carriers and dervishes, dogs and cats,
   soothsayers and barbers; and over all the whining of blind beggars
   crouched in alcoves, and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from
   minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep, unchanging blue.

   The roofed, quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring. Spice, perfume,
   incense beads, rugs, silks, and brass--old Mahmoud Suleiman squats
   cross-legged amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize
   mustard in the hollowed-out capital of an ancient classic column--a
   Roman Corinthian, perhaps from neighboring Heliopolis, where Augustus
   stationed one of his three Egyptian legions. Antiquity begins to mingle
   with exoticism. And then the mosques and the museum--we saw them all,
   and tried not to let our Arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of
   Pharaonic Egypt which the museum's priceless treasures offered. That
   was to be our climax, and for the present we concentrated on the
   mediaeval Saracenic glories of the Califs whose magnificent
   tomb-mosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the
   Arabian Desert.

   At length Abdul took us along the Sharia Mohammed Ali to the ancient
   mosque of Sultan Hassan, and the tower-flanked Babel-Azab, beyond which
   climbs the steep-walled pass to the mighty citadel that Saladin himself
   built with the stones of forgotten pyramids. It was sunset when we
   scaled that cliff, circled the modern mosque of Mohammed Ali, and
   looked down from the dizzy parapet over mystic Cairo--mystic Cairo all
   golden with its carven domes, its ethereal minarets and its flaming
   gardens.

   Far over the city towered the great Roman dome of the new museum; and
   beyond it--across the cryptic yellow Nile that is the mother of eons
   and dynasties--lurked the menacing sands of the Libyan Desert, undulant
   and iridescent and evil with older arcana.

   The red sun sank low, bringing the relentless chill of Egyptian dusk;
   and as it stood poised on the world's rim like that ancient god of
   Heliopolis--Re-Harakhte, the Horizon-Sun--we saw silhouetted against
   its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the Pyramids of Gizeh--the
   palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when
   Tut-Ankh-Amen mounted his golden throne in distant Thebes. Then we knew
   that we were done with Saracen Cairo, and that we must taste the deeper
   mysteries of primal Egypt--the black Kem of Re and Amen, Isis and
   Osiris.

   The next morning we visited the Pyramids, riding out in a Victoria
   across the island of Chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees, and the
   smaller English bridge to the western shore. Down the shore road we
   drove, between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast Zoological
   Gardens to the suburb of Gizeh, where a new bridge to Cairo proper has
   since been built. Then, turning inland along the Sharia-el-Haram, we
   crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till
   before us loomed the objects of our quest, cleaving the mists of dawn
   and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools. Forty centuries,
   as Napoleon had told his campaigners there, indeed looked down upon us.

   The road now rose abruptly, till we finally reached our place of
   transfer between the trolley station and the Mena House Hotel. Abdul
   Reis, who capably purchased our Pyramid tickets, seemed to have an
   understanding with the crowding, yelling and offensive Bedouins who
   inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously
   assailed every traveler; for he kept them very decently at bay and
   secured an excellent pair of camels for us, himself mounting a donkey
   and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys
   more expensive than useful. The area to be traversed was so small that
   camels were hardly needed, but we did not regret adding to our
   experience this troublesome form of desert navigation.

   The pyramids stand on a high rock plateau, this group forming next to
   the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries
   built in the neighborhood of the extinct capital Memphis, which lay on
   the same side of the Nile, somewhat south of Gizeh, and which
   flourished between 3400 and 2000 B.C. The greatest pyramid, which lies
   nearest the modern road, was built by King Cheops or Khufu about 2800
   B.C., and stands more than 450 feet in perpendicular height. In a line
   southwest from this are successively the Second Pyramid, built a
   generation later by King Khephren, and though slightly smaller, looking
   even larger because set on higher ground, and the radically smaller
   Third Pyramid of King Mycerinus, built about 2700 B.C. Near the edge of
   the plateau and due east of the Second Pyramid, with a face probably
   altered to form a colossal portrait of Khephren, its royal restorer,
   stands the monstrous Sphinx--mute, sardonic, and wise beyond mankind
   and memory.

   Minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in
   several places, and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of
   dignitaries of less than royal rank. These latter were originally
   marked by mastabas, or stone bench-like structures about the deep
   burial shafts, as found in other Memphian cemeteries and exemplified by
   Perneb's Tomb in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. At Gizeh,
   however, all such visible things have been swept away by time and
   pillage; and only the rock-hewn shafts, either sand-filled or cleared
   out by archaeologists, remain to attest their former existence.
   Connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives
   offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or vital principle of the
   deceased. The small tombs have their chapels contained in their stone
   mastabas or superstructures, but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids,
   where regal Pharaohs lay, were separate temples, each to the east of
   its corresponding pyramid, and connected by a causeway to a massive
   gate-chapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau.

   The gate-chapel leading to the Second Pyramid, nearly buried in the
   drifting sands, yawns subterraneously south-east of the Sphinx.
   Persistent tradition dubs it the 'Temple of the Sphinx'; and it may
   perhaps be rightly called such if the Sphinx indeed represents the
   Second Pyramid's builder Khephren. There are unpleasant tales of the
   Sphinx before Khephren--but whatever its elder features were, the
   monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus
   without fear.

   It was in the great gateway-temple that the life-size diorite statue of
   Khephren now in the Cairo museum was found; a statue before which I
   stood in awe when I beheld it. Whether the whole edifice is now
   excavated I am not certain, but in 1910 most of it was below ground,
   with the entrance heavily barred at night. Germans were in charge of
   the work, and the war or other things may have stopped them. I would
   give much, in view of my experience and of certain Bedouin whisperings
   discredited or unknown in Cairo, to know what has developed in
   connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of
   the Pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of
   baboons.

   The road, as we traversed it on our camels that morning, curved sharply
   past the wooden police quarters, post office, drug store and shops on
   the left, and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the
   rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee
   of the Great Pyramid. Past Cyclopean masonry we rode, rounding the
   eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids
   beyond which the eternal Nile glistened to the east, and the eternal
   desert shimmered to the west. Very close loomed the three major
   pyramids, the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of
   great stones, but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted
   covering which had made them smooth and finished in their day.

   Presently we descended toward the Sphinx, and sat silent beneath the
   spell of those terrible unseeing eyes. On the vast stone breast we
   faintly discerned the emblem of Re-Harakhte, for whose image the Sphinx
   was mistaken in a late dynasty; and though sand covered the tablet
   between the great paws, we recalled what Thutmosis IV inscribed
   thereon, and the dream he had when a prince. It was then that the smile
   of the Sphinx vaguely displeased us, and made us wonder about the
   legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature,
   leading down, down, to depths none might dare hint at--depths connected
   with mysteries older than the dynastic Egypt we excavate, and having a
   sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal, animal-headed gods in
   the ancient Nilotic pantheon. Then, too, it was I asked myself in idle
   question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour.

   Other tourists now began to overtake us, and we moved on to the
   sand-choked Temple of the Sphinx, fifty yards to the southeast, which I
   have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the
   Second Pyramid's mortuary chapel on the plateau. Most of it was still
   underground, and although we dismounted and descended through a modern
   passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall, I felt that
   Abdul and the local German attendant had not shown us all there was to
   see.

   After this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau,
   examining the Second Pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary
   chapel to the east, the Third Pyramid and its miniature southern
   satellites and ruined eastern chapel, the rock tombs and the
   honeycombings of the Fourth and Fifth dynasties, and the famous
   Campbell's Tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for fifty-three
   feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested
   of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope.

   Cries now assailed us from the Great Pyramid, where Bedouins were
   besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance
   of solitary trips up and down. Seven minutes is said to be the record
   for such an ascent and descent, but many lusty sheiks and sons of
   sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite
   impetus of liberal baksheesh. They did not get this impetus, though we
   did let Abdul take us up, thus obtaining a view of unprecedented
   magnificence which included not only remote and glittering Cairo with
   its crowned citadel back ground of gold-violet hills, but all the
   pyramids of the Memphian district as well, from Abu Roash on the north
   to the Dashur on the south. The Sakkara step-pyramid, which marks the
   evolution of the low mastaba into the true pyramid, showed clearly and
   alluringly in the sandy distance. It is close to this
   transition-monument that the famed tomb of Perneb was found--more than
   four hundred miles north of the Theban rock valley where Tut-Ankh-Amen
   sleeps. Again I was forced to silence through sheer awe. The prospect
   of such antiquity, and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold
   and brood over, filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity
   nothing else ever gave me.

   Fatigued by our climb, and disgusted with the importunate Bedouins
   whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste, we omitted the
   arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the
   pyramids, though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for
   the suffocating crawl through Cheops' mightiest memorial. As we
   dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to Cairo with
   Abdul Reis under the afternoon sun, we half regretted the omission we
   had made. Such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid
   passages not in the guide books; passages whose entrances had been
   hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative
   archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them.

   Of course, this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it; but
   it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to
   enter the Pyramids at night, or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt
   of the Great Pyramid. Perhaps in the latter case it was the
   psychological effect which was feared--the effect on the visitor of
   feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry;
   joined to the life he has known by the merest tube, in which he may
   only crawl, and which any accident or evil design might block. The
   whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the
   pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity. For
   me this opportunity came much earlier than I expected.

   That evening, the members of our party feeling some what tired after
   the strenuous program of the day, I went alone with Abdul Reis for a
   walk through the picturesque Arab quarter. Though I had seen it by day,
   I wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk, when rich shadows
   and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic
   illusion. The native crowds were thinning, but were still very noisy
   and numerous when we came upon a knot of reveling Bedouins in the
   Suken-Nahhasin, or bazaar of the coppersmiths. Their apparent leader,
   an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush, took
   some notice of us, and evidently recognized with no great friendliness
   my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide.

   Perhaps, I thought, he resented that odd reproduction of the Sphinx's
   half-smile which I had often remarked with amused irritation; or
   perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of Abdul's
   voice. At any rate, the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language
   became very brisk; and before long Ali Ziz, as I heard the stranger
   called when called by no worse name, began to pull violently at Abdul's
   robe, an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle
   in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and
   would have reached an even direr condition had I not intervened and
   separated them by main force.

   My interference, at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides, succeeded
   at last in effecting a truce. Sullenly each belligerent composed his
   wrath and his attire, and with an assumption of dignity as profound as
   it was sudden, the two formed a curious pact of honor which I soon
   learned is a custom of great antiquity in Cairo--a pact for the
   settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop
   the Great Pyramid, long after the departure of the last moonlight
   sightseer. Each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds, and the
   affair was to begin at midnight, proceeding by rounds in the most
   civilized possible fashion.

   In all this planning there was much which excited my interest. The
   fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular, while the thought
   of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of
   Gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every
   fiber of imagination in me. A request found Abdul exceedingly willing
   to admit me to his party of seconds; so that all the rest of the early
   evening I accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions
   of the town--mostly northeast of the Ezbekiyeh--where he gathered one
   by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his
   pugilistic background.

   Shortly after nine our party, mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or
   tourist-reminiscent names as 'Rameses,' 'Mark Twain,' 'J. P. Morgan,'
   and 'Minnehaha', edged through street labyrinths both Oriental and
   Occidental, crossed the muddy and mast-forested Nile by the bridge of
   the bronze lions, and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on
   the road to Gizeh. Slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip,
   toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists,
   saluted the last inbound trolley-car, and were alone with the night and
   the past and the spectral moon.

   Then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue, ghoulish with a
   dim atavistical menace which I had not seemed to notice in the daytime.
   Even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly -for was it not in
   this that they had buried Queen Nitocris alive in the Sixth Dynasty;
   subtle Queen Nitocris, who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a
   temple below the Nile, and drowned them by opening the water-gates? I
   recalled that the Arabs whisper things about Nitocris, and shun the
   Third Pyramid at certain phases of the moon. It must have been over her
   that Thomas Moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by
   Memphian boatmen: 'The subterranean nymph that dwells 'Mid sunless gems
   and glories hid-- The lady of the Pyramid!'

   Early as we were, Ali Ziz and his party were ahead of us; for we saw
   their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at Kafrel-Haram;
   toward which squalid Arab settlement, close to the Sphinx, we had
   diverged instead of following the regular road to the Mena House, where
   some of the sleepy, inefficient police might have observed and halted
   us. Here, where filthy Bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock
   tombs of Khephren's courtiers, we were led up the rocks and over the
   sand to the Great Pyramid, up whose time-worn sides the Arabs swarmed
   eagerly, Abdul Reis offering me the assistance I did not need.

   As most travelers know, the actual apex of this structure has long been
   worn away, leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square. On
   this eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed, and in a few moments
   the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which, but for the
   quality of the ringside cries, might well have occurred at some minor
   athletic club in America. As I watched it, I felt that some of our
   less-desirable institutions were not lacking; for every blow, feint,
   and defense bespoke 'stalling' to my not inexperienced eye. It was
   quickly over, and despite my misgivings as to methods I felt a sort of
   proprietary pride when Abdul Reis was adjudged the winner.

   Reconciliation was phenomenally rapid, and amidst the singing,
   fraternizing and drinking that followed, I found it difficult to
   realize that a quarrel had ever occurred. Oddly enough, I myself seemed
   to be more a center of notice than the antagonists; and from my
   smattering of Arabic I judged that they were discussing my professional
   performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement, in
   a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me, but a
   distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape. It
   gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of Egypt did not depart
   without leaving traces, and that fragments of a strange secret lore and
   priestly cult-practices have survived surreptitiously amongst the
   fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or
   magician is resented and disputed. I thought of how much my
   hollow-voiced guide Abdul Reis looked like an old Egyptian priest or
   Pharaoh or smiling Sphinx...and wondered.

   Suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of
   my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby I had accepted
   this night's events as other than the empty and malicious 'frame-up'
   they now showed themselves to be. Without warning, and doubtless in
   answer to some subtle sign from Abdul, the entire band of Bedouins
   precipitated itself upon me; and having produced heavy ropes, soon had
   me bound as securely as I was ever bound in the course of my life,
   either on the stage or off.

   I struggled at first, but soon saw that one man could make no headway
   against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians. My hands were tied
   behind my back, my knees bent to their fullest extent, and my wrists
   and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords. A stifling
   gag was forced into my mouth, and a blindfold fastened tightly over my
   eyes. Then, as Arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a
   jouncing descent of the pyramid, I heard the taunts of my late guide
   Abdul, who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice, and
   assured me that I was soon to have my 'magic-powers' put to a supreme
   test--which would quickly remove any egotism I might have gained
   through triumphing over all the tests offered by America and Europe.
   Egypt, he reminded me, is very old, and full of inner mysteries and
   antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today, whose
   devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me.

   How far or in what direction I was carried, I cannot tell; for the
   circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment.
   I know, however, that it could not have been a great distance; since my
   bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk, yet kept me aloft a
   surprisingly short time. It is this perplexing brevity which makes me
   feel almost like shuddering whenever I think of Gizeh and its
   plateau--for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday
   tourist routes of what existed then and must exist still.

   The evil abnormality I speak of did not become manifest at first.
   Setting me down on a surface which I recognized as sand rather than
   rock, my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few
   feet to a ragged opening in the ground, into which they presently
   lowered me with much rough handling. For apparent eons I bumped against
   the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which I took to be one
   of the numerous burial-shafts of the plateau until the prodigious,
   almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture.

   The horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second. That
   any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without
   reaching the core of the planet itself, or that any rope made by man
   could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly
   fathomless profundities of nether earth, were beliefs of such
   grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to
   accept them. Even now I am uncertain, for I know how deceitful the
   sense of time becomes when one is removed or distorted. But I am quite
   sure that I preserved a logical consciousness that far; that at least I
   did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous
   enough in its reality, and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion
   vastly short of actual hallucination.

   All this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting. The shocking
   ordeal was cumulative, and the beginning of the later terrors was a
   very perceptible increase in my rate of descent. They were paying out
   that infinitely long rope very swiftly now, and I scraped cruelly
   against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as I shot madly
   downward. My clothing was in tatters, and I felt the trickle of blood
   all over, even above the mounting and excruciating pain. My nostrils,
   too, were assailed by a scarcely definable menace: a creeping odor of
   damp and staleness curiously unlike anything I had ever smelled before,
   and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of
   mockery.

   Then the mental cataclysm came. It was horrible--hideous beyond all
   articulate description because it was all of the soul, with nothing of
   detail to describe. It was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation
   of the fiendish. The suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniac--one
   moment I was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of
   million-toothed torture, yet the next moment I was soaring on bat-wings
   in the gulfs of hell; swinging free and swooping through illimitable
   miles of boundless, musty space; rising dizzily to measureless
   pinnacles of chilling ether, then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of
   ravenous, nauseous lower vacua...Thank God for the mercy that shut out
   in oblivion those clawing Furies of consciousness which half unhinged
   my faculties, and tore harpy-like at my spirit! That one respite, short
   as it was, gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still
   greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the
   road ahead.

                                     II

   It was very gradually that I regained my senses after that eldritch
   flight through stygian space. The process was infinitely painful, and
   colored by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition
   found singular embodiment. The precise nature of these dreams was very
   clear while I was experiencing them, but became blurred in my
   recollection almost immediately afterward, and was soon reduced to the
   merest outline by the terrible events--real or imaginary--which
   followed. I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible
   paw; a yellow, hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the
   earth to crush and engulf me. And when I stopped to reflect what the
   paw was, it seemed to me that it was Egypt. In the dream I looked back
   at the events of the preceding weeks, and saw myself lured and enmeshed
   little by little, subtly and insidiously, by some hellish ghoul-spirit
   of the elder Nile sorcery; some spirit that was in Egypt before ever
   man was, and that will be when man is no more.

   I saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of Egypt, and the grisly
   alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead. I
   saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls, falcons,
   cats, and ibises; phantom processions marching interminably through
   subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which
   a man is as a fly, and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable
   gods. Stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of
   grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant
   rivers of pitch. And behind it all I saw the ineffable malignity of
   primordial necromancy, black and amorphous, and fumbling greedily after
   me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by
   emulation.

   In my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred
   and pursuit, and I saw the black soul of Egypt singling me out and
   calling me in inaudible whispers; calling and luring me, leading me on
   with the glitter and glamor of a Saracenic surface, but ever pulling me
   down to the age-mad catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal
   pharaonic heart.

   Then the dream faces took on human resemblances, and I saw my guide
   Abdul Reis in the robes of a king, with the sneer of the Sphinx on his
   features. And I knew that those features were the features of Khephren
   the Great, who raised the Second Pyramid, carved over the Sphinx's face
   in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose
   myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the
   cryptical sand and the uninformative rock. And I looked at the long,
   lean rigid hand of Khephren; the long, lean, rigid hand as I had seen
   it on the diorite statue in the Cairo Museum--the statue they had found
   in the terrible gateway temple--and wondered that I had not shrieked
   when I saw it on Abdul Reis... That hand! It was hideously cold, and it
   was crushing me; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus...the
   chill and constriction of unrememberable Egypt... It was nighted,
   necropolitan Egypt itself...that yellow paw...and they whisper such
   things of Khephren...

   But at this juncture I began to wake--or at least, to assume a
   condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding. I
   recalled the fight atop the pyramid, the treacherous Bedouins and their
   attack, my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths, and
   my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic
   putrescence. I perceived that I now lay on a damp rock floor, and that
   my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force. It was very
   cold, and I seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping
   across me. The cuts and bruises I had received from the jagged sides of
   the rock shaft were paining me woefully, their soreness enhanced to a
   stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint
   draft, and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole
   frame throbbing with untold agony.

   As I turned I felt a tug from above, and concluded that the rope
   whereby I was lowered still reached to the surface. Whether or not the
   Arabs still held it, I had no idea; nor had I any idea how far within
   the earth I was. I knew that the darkness around me was wholly or
   nearly total, since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold; but I
   did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth
   the sensation of vast duration which had characterized my descent.

   Knowing at least that I was in a space of considerable extent reached
   from the above surface directly by an opening in the rock, I doubtfully
   conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old
   Khephren--the Temple of the Sphinx--perhaps some inner corridors which
   the guides had not shown me during my morning visit, and from which I
   might easily escape if I could find my way to the barred entrance. It
   would be a labyrinthine wandering, but no worse than others out of
   which I had in the past found my way.

   The first step was to get free of my bonds, gag, and blindfold; and
   this I knew would be no great task, since subtler experts than these
   Arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long
   and varied career as an exponent of escape, yet had never succeeded in
   defeating my methods.

   Then it occurred to me that the Arabs might be ready to meet and attack
   me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the
   binding cords, as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the
   rope which they probably held. This, of course, was taking for granted
   that my place of confinement was indeed Khephren's Temple of the
   Sphinx. The direct opening in the roof, wherever it might lurk, could
   not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the
   Sphinx; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface,
   since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous. I had
   not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage, but knew
   that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands.

   Thinking these matters over as I lay bent and bound on the rock floor,
   I nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging
   which had so lately reduced me to a coma. My present thought was only
   to outwit the Arabs, and I accordingly determined to work myself free
   as quickly as possible, avoiding any tug on the descending line which
   might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedom.

   This, however, was more easily determined than effected. A few
   preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished
   without considerable motion; and it did not surprise me when, after one
   especially energetic struggle, I began to feel the coils of falling
   rope as they piled up about me and upon me. Obviously, I thought, the
   Bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope;
   hastening no doubt to the temple's true entrance to lie murderously in
   wait for me.

   The prospect was not pleasing--but I had faced worse in my time without
   flinching, and would not flinch now. At present I must first of all
   free myself of bonds, then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple
   unharmed. It is curious how implicitly I had come to believe myself in
   the old temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, only a short distance
   below the ground.

   That belief was shattered, and every pristine apprehension of
   preternatural depth and demoniac mystery revived, by a circumstance
   which grew in horror and significance even as I formulated my
   philosophical plan. I have said that the falling rope was piling up
   about and upon me. Now I saw that it was continuing to pile, as no rope
   of normal length could possibly do. It gained in momentum and became an
   avalanche of hemp, accumulating mountainously on the floor and half
   burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils. Soon I was completely
   engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions
   submerged and stifled me.

   My senses tottered again, and I vaguely tried to fight off a menace
   desperate and ineluctable. It was not merely that I was tortured beyond
   human endurance--not merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed
   slowly out of me--it was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths
   of rope implied, and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable
   gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me. My endless
   descent and swinging flight through goblin space, then, must have been
   real, and even now I must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern
   world toward the core of the planet. Such a sudden confirmation of
   ultimate horror was insupportable, and a second time I lapsed into
   merciful oblivion.

   When I say oblivion, I do not imply that I was free from dreams. On the
   contrary, my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of
   the most unutterable hideousness. God!...If only I had not read so much
   Egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all
   darkness and terror! This second spell of fainting filled my sleeping
   mind anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic
   secrets, and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the
   ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body
   beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves. I
   recalled, in dream-shapes which it is well that I do not remember, the
   peculiar and elaborate construction of Egyptian sepulchers; and the
   exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this
   construction.

   All these people thought of was death and the dead. They conceived of a
   literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with
   desperate care, and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near
   the corpse; whilst besides the body they believed in two other
   elements, the soul, which after its weighing and approval by Osiris
   dwelt in the land of the blest, and the obscure and portentous ka or
   life-principle which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a
   horrible way, demanding occasional access to the preserved body,
   consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to
   the mortuary chapel, and sometimes--as men whispered--taking its body
   or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously
   abroad on errands peculiarly repellent.

   For thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and
   staring glassily upward when not visited by the ka, awaiting the day
   when Osiris should restore both ka and soul, and lead forth the stiff
   legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep. It was to have
   been a glorious rebirth--but not all souls were approved, nor were all
   tombs inviolate, so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish
   abnormalities were to be looked for. Even today the Arabs murmur of
   unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether
   abysses, which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit
   and return unscathed.

   Perhaps the most leeringly blood-congealing legends are those which
   relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft--composite
   mummies made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the
   heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods. At all stages of
   history the sacred animals were mummified, so that consecrated bulls,
   cats, ibises, crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater
   glory. But only in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal
   in the same mummy--only in the decadence, when they did not understand
   the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul.

   What happened to those composite mummies is not told of--at least
   publicly--and it is certain that no Egyptologist ever found one. The
   whispers of Arabs are very wild, and cannot be relied upon. They even
   hint that old Khephren--he of the Sphinx, the Second Pyramid and the
   yawning gateway temple--lives far underground wedded to the ghoul-queen
   Nitocris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of
   beast.

   It was of these--of Khephren and his consort and his strange armies of
   the hybrid dead--that I dreamed, and that is why I am glad the exact
   dream-shapes have faded from my memory. My most horrible vision was
   connected with an idle question I had asked myself the day before when
   looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with
   what unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected.
   That question, so innocent and whimsical then, assumed in my dream a
   meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness...what huge and loathsome
   abnormality was the Sphinx originally carven to represent?

   My second awakening--if awakening it was--is a memory of stark
   hideousness which nothing else in my life--save one thing which came
   after--can parallel; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond
   most men's. Remember that I had lost consciousness whilst buried
   beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the
   cataclysmic depth of my present position. Now, as perception returned,
   I felt the entire weight gone; and realized upon rolling over that
   although I was still tied, gagged and blindfolded, some agency had
   removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had
   overwhelmed me. The significance of this condition, of course, came to
   me only gradually; but even so I think it would have brought
   unconsciousness again had I not by this time reached such a state of
   emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference. I
   was alone... with what?

   Before I could torture myself with any new reflection, or make any
   fresh effort to escape from my bonds, an additional circumstance became
   manifest. Pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs, and I
   seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former
   cuts and abrasions could furnish. My chest, too, seemed pierced by a
   hundred wounds, as though some malign, titanic ibis had been pecking at
   it. Assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one,
   and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled
   to desist. Yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the
   reverse of what one might expect. Instead of sinking into a bottomless
   pit of despair, I was stirred to a new courage and action; for now I
   felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man
   might encounter on an even basis.

   On the strength of this thought I tugged again at my bonds, and used
   all the art of a lifetime to free myself as I had so often done amidst
   the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds. The familiar
   details of my escaping process commenced to engross me, and now that
   the long rope was gone I half regained my belief that the supreme
   horrors were hallucinations after all, and that there had never been
   any terrible shaft, measureless abyss or interminable rope. Was I after
   all in the gateway temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, and had the
   sneaking Arabs stolen in to torture me as I lay helpless there? At any
   rate, I must be free. Let me stand up unbound, ungagged, and with eyes
   open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any
   source, and I could actually delight in the combat against evil and
   treacherous foes!

   How long I took in shaking off my encumbrances I cannot tell. It must
   have been longer than in my exhibition performances, because I was
   wounded, exhausted, and enervated by the experiences I had passed
   through. When I was finally free, and taking deep breaths of a chill,
   damp, evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without
   the screen of gag and blindfold edges, I found that I was too cramped
   and fatigued to move at once. There I lay, trying to stretch a frame
   bent and mangled, for an indefinite period, and straining my eyes to
   catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my
   position.

   By degrees my strength and flexibility returned, but my eyes beheld
   nothing. As I staggered to my feet I peered diligently in every
   direction, yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that I had known
   when blindfolded. I tried my legs, blood-encrusted beneath my shredded
   trousers, and found that I could walk; yet could not decide in what
   direction to go. Obviously I ought not to walk at random, and perhaps
   retreat directly from the entrance I sought; so I paused to note the
   difference of the cold, fetid, natron-scented air-current which I had
   never ceased to feel. Accepting the point of its source as the possible
   entrance to the abyss, I strove to keep track of this landmark and to
   walk consistently toward it.

   I had a match-box with me, and even a small electric flashlight; but of
   course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since
   emptied of all heavy articles. As I walked cautiously in the blackness,
   the draft grew stronger and more offensive, till at length I could
   regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor
   pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the
   fisherman's jar in the Eastern tale. The East...Egypt...truly, this
   dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and
   marvels unspeakable!

   The more I reflected on the nature of this cavern wind, the greater my
   sense of disquiet became; for although despite its odor I had sought
   its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world, I now saw
   plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection
   whatsoever with the clean air of the Libyan Desert, but must be
   essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down. I
   had, then, been walking in the wrong direction!

   After a moment's reflection I decided not to retrace my steps. Away
   from the draft I would have no landmarks, for the roughly level rock
   floor was devoid of distinctive configurations. If, however, I followed
   up the strange current, I would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of
   some sort, from whose gate I could perhaps work round the walls to the
   opposite side of this Cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall. That I
   might fail, I well realized. I saw that this was no part of Khephren's
   gateway temple which tourists know, and it struck me that this
   particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists, and merely
   stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant Arabs who had imprisoned
   me. If so, was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or
   to the outer air?

   What evidence, indeed, did I now possess that this was the gateway
   temple at all? For a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back
   upon me, 'and I thought of that vivid melange of impressions--descent,
   suspension in space, the rope, my wounds, and the dreams that were
   frankly dreams. Was this the end of life for me? Or indeed, would it be
   merciful if this moment were the end? I could answer none of my own
   questions, but merely kept on, till Fate for a third time reduced me to
   oblivion.

   This time there were no dreams, for the suddenness of the incident
   shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious.
   Tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the
   offensive draft became strong enough to offer an actual physical
   resistance, I was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge
   stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved.

   That I ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the
   healthy human organism. Often I look back to that night and feel a
   touch of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness; lapses
   whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude
   cinema melodramas of that period. Of course, it is possible that the
   repeated lapses never occurred; and that all the features of that
   underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which
   began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the
   healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me
   stretched on the sands of Gizeh before the sardonic and dawn-flushed
   face of the Great Sphinx.

   I prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as I can, hence was
   glad when the police told me that the barrier to Krephren's gateway
   temple had been found unfastened, and that a sizeable rift to the
   surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part. I
   was glad, too, when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be
   expected from my seizure, blindfolding, lowering, struggling with
   bonds, falling some distance--perhaps into a depression in the temple's
   inner gallery--dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from
   it, and experiences like that...a very soothing diagnosis. And yet I
   know that there must be more than appears on the surface. That extreme
   descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissed--and it is odd that no
   one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my
   guide, Abdul Reis el Drogman- the tomb-throated guide who looked and
   smiled like King Khephren.

   I have digressed from my connected narrative--perhaps in the vain hope
   of evading the telling of that final incident; that incident which of
   all is most certainly an hallucination. But I promised to relate it,
   and I do not break promises. When I recovered--or seemed to recover--my
   senses after that fall down the black stone stairs, I was quite as
   alone and in darkness as before. The windy stench, bad enough before,
   was now fiendish; yet I had acquired enough familiarity by this time to
   bear it stoically. Dazedly I began to crawl away from the place whence
   the putrid wind came, and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal
   blocks of a mighty pavement. Once my head struck against a hard object,
   and when I felt of it I learned that it was the base of a column--a
   column of unbelievable immensity--whose surface was covered with
   gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch.

   Crawling on, I encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible
   distances apart; when suddenly my attention was captured by the
   realization of something which must have been impinging on my
   subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it.

   From some still lower chasm in earth's bowels were proceeding certain
   sounds, measured and definite, and like nothing I had ever heard
   before. That they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial I felt
   almost intuitively; and much reading in Egyptology led me to associate
   them with the flute, the sambuke, the sistrum, and the tympanum. In
   their rhythmic piping, droning, rattling and beating I felt an element
   of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth--a terror peculiarly
   dissociated from personal fear, and taking the form of a sort of
   objective pity for our planet, that it should hold within its depths
   such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies. The sounds
   increased in volume, and I felt that they were approaching. Then--and
   may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears
   again--I began to hear, faintly and afar off, the morbid and millennial
   tramping of the marching things.

   It was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect
   rhythm. The training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind
   that march of earth's inmost monstrosities...padding, clicking,
   walking, stalking, rumbling, lumbering, crawling...and all to the
   abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments. And then--God keep the
   memory of those Arab legends out of my head!--the mummies without
   souls...the meeting-place of the wandering kas..... the hordes of the
   devil-cursed pharaonic dead of forty centuries...the composite mummies
   led through the uttermost onyx voids by King Khephren and his
   ghoul-queen Nitocris...

   The tramping drew nearer--Heaven save me from the sound of those feet
   and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire
   detail! Down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light
   flickered in the malodorous wind and I drew behind the enormous
   circumference of a Cyclopic column that I might escape for a while the
   horror that was stalking million-footed toward me through gigantic
   hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity. The flickers
   increased, and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud.
   In the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such
   stony awe that I gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and
   repulsion. Bases of columns whose middles were higher than human
   sight... mere bases of things that must each dwarf the Eiffel Tower to
   insignificance...hieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns
   where daylight can be only a remote legend...

   I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as
   I heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music
   and the dead tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but
   God! their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those
   stupendous columns. Hippopotami should not have human hands and carry
   torches... men should not have the heads of crocodiles...

   I tried to turn away, but the shadows and the sounds and the stench
   were everywhere. Then I remembered something I used to do in
   half-conscious nightmares as a boy, and began to repeat to myself,
   'This is a dream! This is a dream!' But it was of no use, and I could
   only shut my eyes and pray...at least, that is what I think I did, for
   one is never sure in visions--and I know this can have been nothing
   more. I wondered whether I should ever reach the world again, and at
   times would furtively open my eyes to see if I could discern any
   feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction, the
   topless columns, and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal
   horror. The sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone, and
   unless this hellish place were wholly without walls, I could not fail
   to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon. But I had to shut my eyes
   again when I realized how many of the things were assembling--and when
   I glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadily without any
   body above the waist.

   A fiendish and ululant corpse-gurgle or death-rattle now split the very
   atmosphere--the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen
   blasts--in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid
   blasphemies. My eyes, perversely shaken open, gazed for an instant upon
   a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic, fear
   and physical exhaustion. The things had filed ceremonially in one
   direction, the direction of the noisome wind, where the light of their
   torches showed their bended heads--or the bended heads of such as had
   heads. They were worshipping before a great black fetor-belching
   aperture which reached up almost out of sight, and which I could see
   was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far
   away in shadow. One of these was indubitably the staircase I had fallen
   down.

   The dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the
   columns--an ordinary house would have been lost in it, and any average
   public building could easily have been moved in and out. It was so vast
   a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its
   boundaries...so vast, so hideously black, and so aromatically
   stinking... Directly in front of this yawning Polyphemus-door the
   things were throwing objects--evidently sacrifices or religious
   offerings, to judge by their gestures. Khephren was their leader;
   sneering King Khephren or the guide Abdul Reis, crowned with a golden
   pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead.
   By his side knelt beautiful Queen Nitocris, whom I saw in profile for a
   moment, noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats
   or other ghouls. And I shut my eyes again when I saw what objects were
   being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its possible local
   deity.

   It occurred to me that, judging from the elaborateness of this worship,
   the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance. Was it
   Osiris or Isis, Horus or Anubis, or some vast unknown God of the Dead
   still more central and supreme? There is a legend that terrible altars
   and colossi were reared to an Unknown One before ever the known gods
   were worshipped...

   And now, as I steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral
   adorations of those nameless things, a thought of escape flashed upon
   me. The hall was dim, and the columns heavy with shadow. With every
   creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures, it
   might be barely possible for me to creep past to the far-away end of
   one of the staircases and ascend unseen; trusting to Fate and skill to
   deliver me from the upper reaches. Where I was, I neither knew nor
   seriously reflected upon--and for a moment it struck me as amusing to
   plan a serious escape from that which I knew to be a dream. Was I in
   some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of Khephren's gateway
   temple--that temple which generations have persistently called the
   Temple of the Sphinx? I could not conjecture, but I resolved to ascend
   to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me.

   Wriggling flat on my stomach, I began the anxious journey toward the
   foot of the left-hand staircase, which seemed the more accessible of
   the two. I cannot describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl,
   but they may be guessed when one reflects on what I had to watch
   steadily in that malign, wind-blown torchlight in order to avoid
   detection. The bottom of the staircase was, as I have said, far away in
   shadow, as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted
   landing above the titanic aperture. This placed the last stages of my
   crawl at some distance from the noisome herd, though the spectacle
   chilled me even when quite remote at my right.

   At length I succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb; keeping
   close to the wall, on which I observed decorations of the most hideous
   sort, and relying for safety on the absorbed, ecstatic interest with
   which the monstrosities watched the foul-breezed aperture and the
   impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before
   it. Though the staircase was huge and steep, fashioned of vast porphyry
   blocks as if for the feet of a giant, the ascent seemed virtually
   interminable. Dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise
   had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of
   agonizing memory. I had intended, on reaching the landing, to climb
   immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from
   there; stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed
   and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet below--yet a sudden
   repetition of that thunderous corpse-gurgle and death-rattle chorus,
   coming as I had nearly gained the top of the flight and showing by its
   ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery, caused me
   to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet.

   The monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of
   the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it. It was
   something quite ponderous, even as seen from my height; something
   yellowish and hairy, and endowed with a sort of nervous motion. It was
   as large, perhaps, as a good-sized hippopotamus, but very curiously
   shaped. It seemed to have no neck, but five separate shaggy heads
   springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk; the first very
   small, the second good-sized, the third and fourth equal and largest of
   all, and the fifth rather small, though not so small as the first.

   Out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized
   ravenously on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food
   placed before the aperture. Once in a while the thing would leap up,
   and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner.
   Its locomotion was so inexplicable that I stared in fascination,
   wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me.

   Then it did emerge...it did emerge, and at the sight I turned and fled
   into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me; fled
   unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to
   which no human sight or logic guided me, and which I must ever relegate
   to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation. It must have been
   a dream, or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands
   of Gizeh before the sardonic dawn-flushed face of the Great Sphinx.

   The Great Sphinx! God!--that idle question I asked myself on that
   sun-blest morning before...what huge and loathsome abnormality was the
   Sphinx originally carven to represent?

   Accursed is the sight, be it in dream or not, that revealed to me the
   supreme horror--the unknown God of the Dead, which licks its colossal
   chops in the unsuspected abyss, fed hideous morsels by soulless
   absurdities that should not exist. The five-headed monster that
   emerged...that five-headed monster as large as a hippopotamus...the
   five headed monster--and that of which it is the merest forepaw...

   But I survived, and I know it was only a dream.

   in the negotiations, and that any such agreement entered into by such
   State or States or political subdivisions thereof shall be subject to
   approval by the Secretary of State.

   Sec. 5. The President is authorized to make effective with respect to
   the temporary headquarters of the United Nations in the State of New
   York, on a provisional basis, such of the provisions of the agreement
   as he may deem appropriate, having due regard for the needs of the
   United Nations at its temporary headquarters.

   Sec. 6. Nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way
   diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the United States to
   safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance of
   aliens into any territory of the United States other than the
   headquarters district and its immediate vicinity, as to be defined and
   fixed in a supplementary agreement between the Government of the United
   States and the United Nations in pursuance of section 13 (3) (e) of the
   agreement, and such areas as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in
   transit between the same and foreign countries. Moreover, nothing in
   section 14 of the agreement with respect to facilitating entrance into
   the United States by persons who wish to visit the headquarters
   district and do not enjoy the right of entry provided in section 11 of
   the agreement shall be construed to amend or suspend in any way the
   immigration laws of the United States or to commit the United States in
   any way to effect any amendment or suspension of such laws.

   Waste Paper
   by H. P. Lovecraft
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Horror author H. P. Lovecraft, who despised T. S. Eliot, called Eliot's
   poem The Wasteland "a practically meaningless collection of phrases,
   learned allusions, quotations, slang, and scraps in general" (S. T.
   Joshi, A dreamer and a visionary, p. 179) and wrote "Waste Paper: A
   Poem Of Profound Insignificance" as a parody.

   -- Excerpted from The Waste Land - Critical reception on Wikipedia, the
   free encyclopedia.

I[edit]

   Out of the reaches of illimitable night
   The blazing planet grew, and forc'd to life
   Unending cycles of progressive strife
   And strange mutations of undying light
   And boresome books, than hell's own self more trite
   And thoughts repeated and become a blight,
   And cheap rum-hounds with moonshine hootch made tight,
   And quite contrite to see the flight of fright so bright
   I used to ride my bicycle in the night
   With a dandy acetylene lantern that cost $3.00
   In the evening, by the moonlight, you can hear those darkies singing
   Meet me tonight - in dreamland... BAH!
   I used to sit on the stairs of the house where I was born
   After we left it but before it was sold
   And play on a zobo with two other boys.
   We called ourselves the Blackstone Military Band
   Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
   In the spring of the year, in the silver rain
   When petal by petal the blossoms fall
   And the mocking birds call
   And the whippoorwill sings, Marguerite.
   The first cinema show in our town opened in 1906
   At the old Olympic, which was then call'd Park,
   And moving beams shot weirdly thro' the dark
   And spit tobacco seldom hit the mark.
   Have you read Dickens' American Notes?
   My great-great-grandfather was born in a white house
   Under green trees in the country
   And he used to believe in religion and the weather.

II[edit]

   "Shantih, shantih, shantih"..."Shanty House"
   Was the name of a novel by I forget whom
   Published serially in the "All-Story Weekly"
   Before it was a weekly. Advt.
   Disillusion is wonderful, I've been told,
   And I take quinine to stop a cold
   But it makes my ears... always...
   Always ringing in my ears...
   It is the ghost of the Jew I murdered that Christmas day
   Because he played "Three O'Clock in the Morning" in the flat above
   me...
   Three O'Clock in the morning, I've danc'd the whole night through
   Dancing on the graves in the graveyard
   Where life is buried; life and beauty
   Life and art and love and duty
   Ah, there, sweet cutie.
   Stung!
   Out of the night that covers me
   Black as the pit from pole to pole
   I never quote things straight except by accident.
   Sophistication! Sophistication!
   You are the idol of our nation
   Each fellow has
   Fallen for jazz
   And we'll give the past a merry razz
   Thro' the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber
   And fellow-guestship with the glutless worm.
   Next stop is 57th St. - 57th St. the next stop.
   Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring,
   And the governor-general of Canada is Lord Byng
   Whose ancestor was shot or hung,
   I forget which, the good die young.
   Here's to your ripe old age,
   Copyright, 1847, by Joseph Miner,
   Entered according to act of Congress.

   In the office of the librarian of Congress
   America was discovered in 1492
   This way out.
   No, lady, you gotta change at Washington St. to the Everett train.
   Out in the rain on the elevated
   Crated, sated, all mismated.
   Twelve seats on this bench,
   How quaint.
   In a shady nook, beside a brook, two lovers stroll along.
   Express to Park Ave., Car Following.
   No, we had it cleaned with the sand blast.
   I know it ought to be torn down.
   Before the bar of a saloon there stood a reckless crew,
   When one said to another, "Jack, this message came for you."
   "It may be from a sweetheart, boys," said someone in the crowd,
   And here the words are missing... but Jack cried out aloud:
   "It's only a message from home, sweet home,
   From loved ones down on the farm
   Fond wife and mother, sister and brother..."
   Bootleggers all and you're another
   In the shade of the old apple tree
   'Neath the old cherry tree sweet Marie
   The Conchologist's First Book
   By Edgar Allan Poe
   Stubbed his toe
   On a broken brick that didn't show
   Or a banana peel

   By George Creel
   It is to laugh
   And quaff
   It makes you stout and hale
   And all my days I'll sing the praise
   Of Ivory Soap
   Have you a little T. S. Eliot in your house?

IV[edit]

   The stag at eve had drunk his fill
   The thirsty hart look'd up the hill
   And craned his neck just as a feeler
   To advertise the Double-Dealer.
   William Congreve was a gentleman
   O art what sins are committed in thy name
   For tawdry fame and fleeting flame
   And everything, ain't dat a shame?
   Mah Creole Belle, ah lubs yo' well;
   Aroun' mah heart you hab cast a spell
   But I can't learn to spell pseudocracy
   Because there ain't no such word.
   And I says to Lizzie, if Joe was my feller
   I'd teach him to go to dances with that
   Rat, bat, cat, hat, flat, plat, fat
   Fry the fat, fat the fry
   You'll be a drug-store by and by.
   Get the hook!
   Above the lines of brooding hills
   Rose spires that reeked of nameless ills,
   And ghastly shone upon the sight
   In ev'ry flash of lurid light
   To be continued.
   No smoking.
   Smoking on four rear seats.
   Fare win return to 5 cents after August 1st
   Except outside the Cleveland city limits.
   In the ghoul-haunted Woodland of Weir
   Strangers pause to shed a tear;
   Henry Fielding wrote "Tom Jones"
   And cursed be he that moves my bones.
   I saw the Leonard-Tendler fight
   Farewell, farewell, O go to hell.
   Nobody home
   In the shantih.

Issues[edit]

   Each issue is represented by a second-level heading with the cover
   date. The cover of the issue will be visible on the right of each entry
   if in the public domain; if not, a box with copyright renewal
   information will take its place. Each issue is described in this
   format:

   The volume and issue number will link to a proofread version of the
   issue where available; in these cases, the template {{Small scan link}}
   will also be present. Cover art, editor information and other
   issue-wide information will be shown between the issue number and the
   bulleted list of contents (if this is consistant throughout the year,
   it will be in the notes section of the header instead). Items refer to
   each text within the issue; these will be linked to the appropriate
   text if it is in the public domain.

       or related to "Name."
     * [as Pseudonym] - indicates that the author is known to have used a

   Weird Tales (Canadian, 2nd series)  (1942-1951)
     * Related Portals. related portals: Weird Tales, Periodicals.
     * Sister Projects. sister projects: Data item.

   Canadian reprint of Weird Tales, the United States pulp magazine and
   the second series of reprints (the first ran 1935-1936). This series
   was puiblished bi-monthly, two issues behind the American version;
   until March 1945, from which it ran just one issue behind. Not all
   contents were identical and some came from another pulp magazine, Short
   Stories; illustrations were original to the Canadian edition. Note that
   this series re-used volume and serial numbers (and had none for the
   final issue), so these subpages are structured based on the cover date.

What the Moon Brings

   From Wikisource

   What the Moon Brings
   by H. P. Lovecraft
   8530What the Moon BringsH. P. Lovecraft

   I hate the moon - I am afraid of it - for when it shines on certain
   scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and
   hideous.

   It was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old
   garden where I wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and
   humid seas of foliage that bring wild and many-coloured dreams. And as
   I walked by the shallow crystal stream I saw unwonted ripples tipped
   with yellow light, as if those placid waters were drawn on in
   resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world. Silent
   and sparkling, bright and baleful, those moon-cursed waters hurried I
   knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotos-blossoms
   fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped despairingly
   into the stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven
   bridge, and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm, dead
   faces.

   And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless
   feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of
   the dead faces, I saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for
   where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new vistas of
   trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and
   bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under
   grotesque bridges of marble. And the lips of the dead lotos-faces
   whispered sadly, and bade me follow, nor did I cease my steps till the
   stream became a river, and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and
   beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea.

   Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird
   perfumes breeded. And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed
   for nets that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets
   which the moon had brought upon the night. But when that moon went over
   to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in
   that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white
   columns gay with festoons of green seaweed. And knowing that to this
   sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not wish again
   to speak with the lotos-faces.

   Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky
   to seek rest on a vast reef, I would fain have questioned him, and
   asked him of those whom I had known when they were alive. This I would
   have asked him had he not been so far away, but he was very far, and
   could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef.

   So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming
   the spires, the towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city. And
   as I watched, my nostrils tried to close against the perfume-conquering
   stench of the world's dead; for truly, in this unplaced and forgotten
   spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy sea-worms
   to gnaw and glut upon.

   Over these horrors the evil moon now hung very low, but the puffy worms
   of the sea need no moon to feed by. And as I watched the ripples that
   told of the writhing of worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out
   whither the condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before
   my eyes had seen it.

   Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I
   saw that the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef
   whose rim I had seen before. And when I saw that the reef was but the
   black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now
   shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish
   ooze miles below, I shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise
   above the waters, and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the
   slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon.

   And to escape this relentless thing I plunged gladly and unhesitantly
   into the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets
   fat sea-worms feast upon the world's dead.

   Where Once Poe Walked

   Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,
   Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;
   Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,
   Arched high above a hidden world of yore.
   Round all the scene a light of memory plays,
   And dead leaves whisper of departed days,
   Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.

   Lonely and sad, a specter glides along
   Aisles where of old his living footsteps fell;
   No common glance discerns him, though his song
   Peals down through time with a mysterious spell.
   Only the few who sorcery's secret know,
   Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe.

   Winged Death  (1932)

   1364035Winged DeathH.P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald1932

   The Orange Hotel stands in High Street near the railway station in
   Bloemfontein, South Africa. On Sunday, January 24, 1932, four men sat
   shivering from terror in a room on its third floor. One was George C.
   Titteridge, proprietor of the hotel; another was police constable Ian
   De Witt of the Central Station; a third was Johannes Bogaert, the local
   coroner; the fourth, and apparently the least disorganised of the
   group, was Dr. Cornelius Van Keulen, the coroner's physician. On the
   floor, uncomfortably evident amidst the stifling summer heat, was the
   body of a dead man--but this was not what the four were afraid of.
   Their glances wandered from the table, on which lay a curious
   assortment of things, to the ceiling overhead, across whose smooth
   whiteness a series of huge, faltering alphabetical characters had
   somehow been scrawled in ink; and every now and then Dr. Van Keulen
   would glance half-furtively at a worn leather blank-book which he held
   in his left hand. The horror of the four seemed about equally divided
   among the blank-book, the scrawled words on the ceiling, and a dead fly
   of peculiar aspect which floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table.
   Also on the table were an open inkwell, a pen and writing-pad, a
   physician's medical case, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and a tumbler
   about a quarter full of black oxide of manganese. The worn leather book
   was the journal of the dead man on the floor, and had at once made it
   clear that the name "Frederick N. Mason, Mining Properties, Toronto,
   Canada", signed in the hotel register, was a false one. There were
   other things--terrible things--which it likewise made clear; and still
   other things of far greater terror at which it hinted hideously without
   making them clear or even fully believable. It was the half-belief of
   the four men, fostered by lives spent close to the black, settled
   secrets of brooding Africa, which made them shiver so violently in
   spite of the searing January heat. The blank-book was not a large one,
   and the entries were in a fine handwriting, which, however, grew
   careless and nervous-looking toward the last. It consisted of a series
   of jottings at first rather irregularly spaced, but finally becoming
   daily. To call it a diary would not be quite correct, for it chronicled
   only one set of its writer's activities. Dr. Van Keulen recognised the
   name of the dead man the moment he opened the cover, for it was that of
   an eminent member of his own profession who had been largely connected
   with African matters. In another moment he was horrified to find this
   name linked with a dastardly crime, officially unsolved, which had
   filled the newspapers some four months before. And the farther he read,
   the deeper grew his horror, awe, and sense of loathing and panic. Here,
   in essence, is the text which the doctor read aloud in that sinister
   and increasingly noisome room while the three men around him breathed
   hard, fidgeted in their chairs, and darted frightened glances at the
   ceiling, the table, the thing on the floor, and one another:

   JOURNAL OF THOMAS SLAUENWITE, M.D.

   Touching punishment of Henry Sargent Moore, Ph.D., of Brooklyn, New
   York, Professor of Invertebrate Biology in Columbia University, New
   York, N.Y. Prepared to be read after my death, for the satisfaction of
   making public the accomplishment of my revenge, which may otherwise
   never be imputed to me even if it succeeds. January 5, 1929--I have now
   fully resolved to kill Dr. Henry Moore, and a recent incident has shewn
   me how I shall do it. From now on, I shall follow a consistent line of
   action; hence the beginning of this journal. It is hardly necessary to
   repeat the circumstances which have driven me to this course, for the
   informed part of the public is familiar with all the salient facts. I
   was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on April 12, 1885, the son of Dr. Paul
   Slauenwite, formerly of Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. Studying
   medicine as part of my family tradition, I was led by my father (who
   died in 1916, while I was serving in France in a South African
   regiment) to specialise in African fevers; and after my graduation from
   Columbia spent much time in researches which took me from Durban, in
   Natal, up to the equator itself. In Mombasa I worked out my new theory
   of the transmission and development of remittent fever, aided only
   slightly by the papers of the late government physician, Sir Norman
   Sloane, which I found in the house I occupied. When I published my
   results I became at a single stroke a famous authority. I was told of
   the probability of an almost supreme position in the South African
   health service, and even a probable knighthood, in the event of my
   becoming a naturalised citizen, and accordingly I took the necessary
   steps. Then occurred the incident for which I am about to kill Henry
   Moore. This man, my classmate and friend of years in America and
   Africa, chose deliberately to undermine my claim to my own theory;
   alleging that Sir Norman Sloane had anticipated me in every essential
   detail, and implying that I had probably found more of his papers than
   I had stated in my account of the matter. To buttress this absurd
   accusation he produced certain personal letters from Sir Norman which
   indeed shewed that the older man had been over my ground, and that he
   would have published his results very soon but for his sudden death.
   This much I could only admit with regret. What I could not excuse was
   the jealous suspicion that I had stolen the theory from Sir Norman's
   papers. The British government, sensibly enough, ignored these
   aspersions, but withheld the half-promised appointment and knighthood
   on the ground that my theory, while original with me, was not in fact
   new. I could soon see that my career in Africa was perceptibly checked;
   though I had placed all my hopes on such a career, even to the point of
   resigning American citizenship. A distinct coolness toward me had
   arisen among the Government set in Mombasa, especially among those who
   had known Sir Norman. It was then that I resolved to be even with Moore
   sooner or later, though I did not know how. He had been jealous of my
   early celebrity, and had taken advantage of his old correspondence with
   Sir Norman to ruin me. This from the friend whom I had myself led to
   take an interest in Africa--whom I had coached and inspired till he
   achieved his present moderate fame as an authority on African
   entomology. Even now, though, I will not deny that his attainments are
   profound. I made him, and in return he has ruined me. Now--some day--I
   shall destroy him. When I saw myself losing ground in Mombasa, I
   applied for my present situation in the interior--at M'gonga, only
   fifty miles from the Uganda line. It is a cotton and ivory
   trading-post, with only eight white men besides myself. A beastly hole,
   almost on the equator, and full of every sort of fever known to
   mankind. Poisonous snakes and insects everywhere, and niggers with
   diseases nobody ever heard of outside medical college. But my work is
   not hard, and I have always had plenty of time to plan things to do to
   Henry Moore. It amuses me to give his Diptera of Central and Southern
   Africa a prominent place on my shelf. I suppose it actually is a
   standard manual--they use it at Columbia, Harvard, and the U. of
   Wis.--but my own suggestions are really responsible for half its strong
   points. Last week I encountered the thing which decided me how to kill
   Moore. A party from Uganda brought in a black with a queer illness
   which I can't yet diagnose. He was lethargic, with a very low
   temperature, and shuffled in a peculiar way. Most of the others were
   afraid of him and said he was under some kind of witch-doctor spell;
   but Gobo, the interpreter, said he had been bitten by an insect. What
   it was, I can't imagine--for there is only a slight puncture on the
   arm. It is bright red, though, with a purple ring around it.
   Spectral-looking--I don't wonder the boys lay it to black magic. They
   seem to have seen cases like it before, and say there's really nothing
   to do about it. Old N'Kuru, one of the Galla boys at the post, says it
   must be the bite of a devil-fly, which makes its victim waste away
   gradually and die, and then takes hold of his soul and personality if
   it is still alive itself--flying around with all his likes, dislikes,
   and consciousness. A queer legend--and I don't know of any local insect
   deadly enough to account for it. I gave this sick black--his name is
   Mevana--a good shot of quinine and took a sample of his blood for
   testing, but haven't made much progress. There is certainly a strange
   germ present, but I can't even remotely identify it. The nearest thing
   to it is the bacillus one finds in oxen, horses, and dogs that the
   tsetse-fly has bitten; but tsetse-flies don't infect human beings, and
   this is too far north for them anyway. However--the important thing is
   that I've decided how to kill Moore. If this interior region has
   insects as poisonous as the natives say, I'll see that he gets a
   shipment of them from a source he won't suspect, and with plenty of
   assurances that they are harmless. Trust him to throw overboard all
   caution when it comes to studying an unknown species--and then we'll
   see how Nature takes its course! It ought not to be hard to find an
   insect that scares the blacks so much. First to see how poor Mevana
   turns out--and then to find my envoy of death. Jan. 7--Mevana is no
   better, though I have injected all the antitoxins I know of. He has
   fits of trembling, in which he rants affrightedly about the way his
   soul will pass when he dies into the insect that bit him, but between
   them he remains in a kind of half-stupor. Heart action still strong, so
   I may pull him through. I shall try to, for he can probably guide me
   better than anyone else to the region where he was bitten. Meanwhile
   I'll write to Dr. Lincoln, my predecessor here, for Allen, the head
   factor, says he had a profound knowledge of the local sicknesses. He
   ought to know about the death-fly if any white man does. He's at
   Nairobi now, and a black runner ought to get me a reply in a
   week--using the railway for half the trip. Jan. 10--Patient unchanged,
   but I have found what I want! It was in an old volume of the local
   health records, which I've been going over diligently while waiting to
   hear from Lincoln. Thirty years ago there was an epidemic that killed
   off thousands of natives in Uganda, and it was definitely traced to a
   rare fly called Glossina palpalis--a sort of cousin of the Glossina
   marsitans, or tsetse. It lives in the bushes on the shores of lakes and
   rivers, and feeds on the blood of crocodiles, antelopes, and large
   mammals. When these food animals have the germ of trypanosomiasis, or
   sleeping-sickness, it picks it up and develops acute infectivity after
   an incubation period of thirty-one days. Then for seventy-five days it
   is sure death to anyone or anything it bites. Without doubt, this must
   be the "devil-fly" the niggers talk about. Now I know what I'm heading
   for. Hope Mevana pulls through. Ought to hear from Lincoln in four or
   five days--he has a great reputation for success in things like this.
   My worst problem will be to get the flies to Moore without his
   recognising them. With his cursed plodding scholarship it would be just
   like him to know all about them since they're actually on record. Jan.
   15--Just heard from Lincoln, who confirms all that the records say
   about Glossina palpalis. He has a remedy for sleeping-sickness which
   has succeeded in a great number of cases when not given too late.
   Intermuscular injections of tryparsamide. Since Mevana was bitten about
   two months ago, I don't know how it will work--but Lincoln says that
   cases have been known to drag on eighteen months, so possibly I'm not
   too late. Lincoln sent over some of his stuff, so I've just given
   Mevana a stiff shot. In a stupor now. They've brought his principal
   wife from the village, but he doesn't even recognise her. If he
   recovers, he can certainly shew me where the flies are. He's a great
   crocodile hunter, according to report, and knows all Uganda like a
   book. I'll give him another shot tomorrow. Jan. 16--Mevana seems a
   little brighter today, but his heart action is slowing up a bit. I'll
   keep up the injections, but not overdo them. Jan. 17--Recovery really
   pronounced today. Mevana opened his eyes and shewed signs of actual
   consciousness, though dazed, after the injection. Hope Moore doesn't
   know about tryparsamide. There's a good chance he won't, since he never
   leaned much toward medicine. Mevana's tongue seemed paralysed, but I
   fancy that will pass off if I can only wake him up. Wouldn't mind a
   good sleep myself, but not of this kind! Jan. 25--Mevana nearly cured!
   In another week I can let him take me into the jungle. He was
   frightened when he first came to--about having the fly take his
   personality after he died--but brightened up finally when I told him he
   was going to get well. His wife, Ugowe, takes good care of him now, and
   I can rest a bit. Then for the envoys of death! Feb. 3--Mevana is well
   now, and I have talked with him about a hunt for flies. He dreads to go
   near the place where they got him, but I am playing on his gratitude.
   Besides, he has an idea that I can ward off disease as well as cure it.
   His pluck would shame a white man--there's no doubt that he'll go. I
   can get off by telling the head factor the trip is in the interest of
   local health work. March 12--In Uganda at last! Have five boys besides
   Mevana, but they are all Gallas. The local blacks couldn't be hired to
   come near the region after the talk of what had happened to Mevana.
   This jungle is a pestilential place--steaming with miasmal vapours. All
   the lakes look stagnant. In one spot we came upon a trace of Cyclopean
   ruins which made even the Gallas run past in a wide circle. They say
   these megaliths are older than man, and that they used to be a haunt or
   outpost of "The Fishers from Outside"--whatever that means--and of the
   evil gods Tsadogwa and Clulu. To this day they are said to have a
   malign influence, and to be connected somehow with the devil-flies.
   March 15--Struck Lake Mlolo this morning--where Mevana was bitten. A
   hellish, green-scummed affair, full of crocodiles. Mevana has fixed up
   a fly-trap of fine wire netting baited with crocodile meat. It has a
   small entrance, and once the quarry get in, they don't know enough to
   get out. As stupid as they are deadly, and ravenous for fresh meat or a
   bowl of blood. Hope we can get a good supply. I've decided that I must
   experiment with them--finding a way to change their appearance so that
   Moore won't recognise them. Possibly I can cross them with some other
   species, producing a strange hybrid whose infection-carrying capacity
   will be undiminished. We'll see. I must wait, but am in no hurry now.
   When I get ready I'll have Mevana get me some infected meat to feed my
   envoys of death--and then for the post-office. Ought to be no trouble
   getting infection, for this country is a veritable pest-hole. March
   16--Good luck. Two cages full. Five vigorous specimens with wings
   glistening like diamonds. Mevana is emptying them into a large can with
   a tightly meshed top, and I think we caught them in the nick of time.
   We can get them to M'gonga without trouble. Taking plenty of crocodile
   meat for their food. Undoubtedly all or most of it is infected. April
   20--Back at M'gonga and busy in the laboratory. Have sent to Dr. Joost
   in Pretoria for some tsetse-flies for hybridisation experiments. Such a
   crossing, if it will work at all, ought to produce something pretty
   hard to recognise yet at the same time just as deadly as the palpalis.
   If this doesn't work, I shall try certain other diptera from the
   interior, and I have sent to Dr. Vandervelde at Nyangwe for some of the
   Congo types. I shan't have to send Mevana for more tainted meat after
   all; for I find I can keep cultures of the germ Trypanosoma gambiense,
   taken from the meat we got last month, almost indefinitely in tubes.
   When the time comes, I'll taint some fresh meat and feed my winged
   envoys a good dose--then bon voyage to them! June 18--My tsetse-flies
   from Joost came today. Cages for breeding were all ready long ago, and
   I am now making selections. Intend to use ultra-violet rays to speed up
   the life-cycle. Fortunately I have the needed apparatus in my regular
   equipment. Naturally I tell no one what I'm doing. The ignorance of the
   few men here makes it easy for me to conceal my aims and pretend to be
   merely studying existing species for medical reasons. June 29--The
   crossing is fertile! Good deposits of eggs last Wednesday, and now I
   have some excellent larvae. If the mature insects look as strange as
   these do, I need do nothing more. Am preparing separate numbered cages
   for the different specimens. July 7--New hybrids are out! Disguise is
   excellent as to shape, but sheen of wings still suggests palpalis.
   Thorax has faint suggestions of the stripes of the tsetse. Slight
   variation in individuals. Am feeding them all on tainted crocodile
   meat, and after infectivity develops will try them on some of the
   blacks--apparently, of course, by accident. There are so many mildly
   venomous flies around here that it can easily be done without exciting
   suspicion. I shall loose an insect in my tightly screened dining-room
   when Batta, my house-boy, brings in breakfast--keeping well on guard
   myself. When it has done its work I'll capture or swat it--an easy
   thing because of its stupidity--or asphyxiate it by filling the room
   with chlorine gas. If it doesn't work the first time, I'll try again
   until it does. Of course, I'll have the tryparsamide handy in case I
   get bitten myself--but I shall be careful to avoid biting, for no
   antidote is really certain. Aug. 10--Infectivity mature, and managed to
   get Batta stung in fine shape. Caught the fly on him, returning it to
   its cage. Eased up the pain with iodine, and the poor devil is quite
   grateful for the service. Shall try a variant specimen on Gamba, the
   factor's messenger, tomorrow. That will be all the tests I shall dare
   to make here, but if I need more I shall take some specimens to Ukala
   and get additional data. Aug. 11--Failed to get Gamba, but recaptured
   the fly alive. Batta still seems as well as usual, and has no pain in
   the back where he was stung. Shall wait before trying to get Gamba
   again. Aug. 14--Shipment of insects from Vandervelde at last. Fully
   seven distinct species, some more or less poisonous. Am keeping them
   well fed in case the tsetse crossing doesn't work. Some of these
   fellows look very unlike the palpalis, but the trouble is that they may
   not make a fertile cross with it. Aug. 17--Got Gamba this afternoon,
   but had to kill the fly on him. It nipped him in the left shoulder. I
   dressed the bite, and Gamba is as grateful as Batta was. No change in
   Batta. Aug. 20--Gamba unchanged so far--Batta too. Am experimenting
   with a new form of disguise to supplement the hybridisation--some sort
   of dye to change the telltale glitter of the palpalis' wings. A bluish
   tint would be best--something I could spray on a whole batch of
   insects. Shall begin by investigating things like Prussian and
   Turnbull's blue--iron and cyanogen salts. Aug. 25--Batta complained of
   a pain in his back today--things may be developing. Sept. 3--Have made
   fair progress in my experiments. Batta shews signs of lethargy, and
   says his back aches all the time. Gamba beginning to feel uneasy in his
   bitten shoulder. Sept. 24--Batta worse and worse, and beginning to get
   frightened about his bite. Thinks it must be a devil-fly, and entreated
   me to kill it--for he saw me cage it--until I pretended to him that it
   had died long ago. Said he didn't want his soul to pass into it upon
   his death. I give him shots of plain water with a hypodermic to keep
   his morale up. Evidently the fly retains all the properties of the
   palpalis. Gamba down, too, and repeating all of Batta's symptoms. I may
   decide to give him a chance with tryparsamide, for the effect of the
   fly is proved well enough. I shall let Batta go on, however, for I want
   a rough idea of how long it takes to finish a case. Dye experiments
   coming along finely. An isomeric form of ferrous ferrocyanide, with
   some admixture of potassium salts, can be dissolved in alcohol and
   sprayed on the insects with splendid effect. It stains the wings blue
   without affecting the dark thorax much, and doesn't wear off when I
   sprinkle the specimens with water. With this disguise, I think I can
   use the present tsetse hybrids and avoid bothering with any more
   experiments. Sharp as he is, Moore couldn't recognise a blue-winged fly
   with a half-tsetse thorax. Of course, I keep all this dye business
   strictly under cover. Nothing must ever connect me with the blue flies
   later on. Oct. 9--Batta is lethargic and has taken to his bed. Have
   been giving Gamba tryparsamide for two weeks, and fancy he'll recover.
   Oct. 25--Batta very low, but Gamba nearly well. Nov. 18--Batta died
   yesterday, and a curious thing happened which gave me a real shiver in
   view of the native legends and Batta's own fears. When I returned to
   the laboratory after the death I heard the most singular buzzing and
   thrashing in cage 12, which contained the fly that bit Batta. The
   creature seemed frantic, but stopped still when I appeared--lighting on
   the wire netting and looking at me in the oddest way. It reached its
   legs through the wires as if it were bewildered. When I came back from
   dining with Allen, the thing was dead. Evidently it had gone wild and
   beaten its life out on the sides of the cage. It certainly is peculiar
   that this should happen just as Batta died. If any black had seen it,
   he'd have laid it at once to the absorption of the poor devil's soul. I
   shall start my blue-stained hybrids on their way before long now. The
   hybrid's rate of killing seems a little ahead of the pure palpalis'
   rate, if anything. Batta died three months and eight days after
   infection--but of course there is always a wide margin of uncertainty.
   I almost wish I had let Gamba's case run on. Dec. 5--Busy planning how
   to get my envoys to Moore. I must have them appear to come from some
   disinterested entomologist who has read his Diptera of Central and
   Southern Africa and believes he would like to study this "new and
   unidentifiable species". There must also be ample assurances that the
   blue-winged fly is harmless, as proved by the natives' long experience.
   Moore will be off his guard, and one of the flies will surely get him
   sooner or later--though one can't tell just when. I'll have to rely on
   the letters of New York friends--they still speak of Moore from time to
   time--to keep me informed of early results, though I dare say the
   papers will announce his death. Above all, I must shew no interest in
   his case. I shall mail the flies while on a trip, but must not be
   recognised when I do it. The best plan will be to take a long vacation
   in the interior, grow a beard, mail the package at Ukala while passing
   as a visiting entomologist, and return here after shaving off the
   beard. April 12, 1930--Back in M'gonga after my long trip. Everything
   has come off finely--with clockwork precision. Have sent the flies to
   Moore without leaving a trace. Got a Christmas vacation Dec. 15th, and
   set out at once with the proper stuff. Made a very good mailing
   container with room to include some germ-tainted crocodile meat as food
   for the envoys. By the end of February I had beard enough to shape into
   a close Vandyke. Shewed up at Ukala March 9th and typed a letter to
   Moore on the trading-post machine. Signed it "Nevil
   Wayland-Hall"--supposed to be an entomologist from London. Think I took
   just the right tone--interest of a brother-scientist, and all that. Was
   artistically casual in emphasising the "complete harmlessness" of the
   specimens. Nobody suspected anything. Shaved the beard as soon as I hit
   the bush, so that there wouldn't be any uneven tanning by the time I
   got back here. Dispensed with native bearers except for one small
   stretch of swamp--I can do wonders with one knapsack, and my sense of
   direction is good. Lucky I'm used to such travelling. Explained my
   protracted absence by pleading a touch of fever and some mistakes in
   direction when going through the bush. But now comes the hardest part
   psychologically--waiting for news of Moore without shewing the strain.
   Of course, he may possibly escape a bite until the venom is played
   out--but with his recklessness the chances are one hundred to one
   against him. I have no regrets; after what he did to me, he deserves
   this and more. June 30, 1930--Hurrah! The first step worked! Just heard
   casually from Dyson of Columbia that Moore had received some new
   blue-winged flies from Africa, and that he is badly puzzled over them!
   No word of any bite--but if I know Moore's slipshod ways as I think I
   do, there'll be one before long! August 27, 1930--Letter from Morton in
   Cambridge. He says Moore writes of feeling very run-down, and tells of
   an insect bite on the back of his neck--from a curious new specimen
   that he received about the middle of June. Have I succeeded? Apparently
   Moore doesn't connect the bite with his weakness. If this is the real
   stuff, then Moore was bitten well within the insect's period of
   infectivity. Sept. 12, 1930--Victory! Another line from Dyson says that
   Moore is really in an alarming shape. He now traces his illness to the
   bite, which he received around noon on June 19, and is quite bewildered
   about the identity of the insect. Is trying to get in touch with the
   "Nevil Wayland-Hall" who sent him the shipment. Of the hundred-odd that
   I sent, about twenty-five seem to have reached him alive. Some escaped
   at the time of the bite, but several larvae have appeared from eggs
   laid since the time of mailing. He is, Dyson says, carefully incubating
   these larvae. When they mature I suppose he'll identify the
   tsetse-palpalis hybridisation--but that won't do him much good now.
   He'll wonder, though, why the blue wings aren't transmitted by
   heredity! Nov. 8, 1930--Letters from half a dozen friends tell of
   Moore's serious illness. Dyson's came today. He says Moore is utterly
   at sea about the hybrids that came from the larvae and is beginning to
   think that the parents got their blue wings in some artificial way. Has
   to stay in bed most of the time now. No mention of using tryparsamide.
   Feb. 13, 1931--Not so good! Moore is sinking, and seems to know no
   remedy, but I think he suspects me. Had a very chilly letter from
   Morton last month, which told nothing of Moore; and now Dyson
   writes--also rather constrainedly--that Moore is forming theories about
   the whole matter. He's been making a search for "Wayland-Hall" by
   telegraph--at London, Ukala, Nairobi, Mombasa, and other places--and of
   course finds nothing. I judge that he's told Dyson whom he suspects,
   but that Dyson doesn't believe it yet. Fear Morton does believe it. I
   see that I'd better lay plans for getting out of here and effacing my
   identity for good. What an end to a career that started out so well!
   More of Moore's work--but this time he's paying for it in advance!
   Believe I'll go back to South Africa--and meanwhile will quietly
   deposit funds there to the credit of my new self--"Frederick Nasmyth
   Mason of Toronto, Canada, broker in mining properties". Will establish
   a new signature for identification. If I never have to take the step, I
   can easily re-transfer the funds to my present self. Aug. 15,
   1931--Half a year gone, and still suspense. Dyson and Morton--as well
   as several other friends--seem to have stopped writing me. Dr. James of
   San Francisco hears from Moore's friends now and then, and says Moore
   is in an almost continuous coma. He hasn't been able to walk since May.
   As long as he could talk he complained of being cold. Now he can't
   talk, though it is thought he still has glimmers of consciousness. His
   breathing is short and quick, and can be heard some distance away. No
   question but that Trypanosoma gambiense is feeding on him--but he holds
   out better than the niggers around here. Three months and eight days
   finished Batta, and here Moore is alive over a year after his biting.
   Heard rumours last month of an intensive search around Ukala for
   "Wayland-Hall". Don't think I need to worry yet, though, for there's
   absolutely nothing in existence to link me with this business. Oct. 7,
   1931--It's over at last! News in the Mombasa Gazette. Moore died
   September 20 after a series of trembling fits and with a temperature
   vastly below normal. So much for that! I said I'd get him, and I did!
   The paper had a three-column report of his long illness and death, and
   of the futile search for "Wayland-Hall". Obviously, Moore was a bigger
   character in Africa than I had realised. The insect that bit him has
   now been fully identified from the surviving specimens and developed
   larvae, and the wing-staining is also detected. It is universally
   realised that the flies were prepared and shipped with intent to kill.
   Moore, it appears, communicated certain suspicions to Dyson, but the
   latter--and the police--are maintaining secrecy because of absence of
   proof. All of Moore's enemies are being looked up, and the Associated
   Press hints that "an investigation, possibly involving an eminent
   physician now abroad, will follow". One thing at the very end of the
   report--undoubtedly, the cheap romancing of a yellow journalist--gives
   me a curious shudder in view of the legends of the blacks and the way
   the fly happened to go wild when Batta died. It seems that an odd
   incident occurred on the night of Moore's death; Dyson having been
   aroused by the buzzing of a blue-winged fly--which immediately flew out
   the window--just before the nurse telephoned the death news from
   Moore's home, miles away in Brooklyn. But what concerns me most is the
   African end of the matter. People at Ukala remember the bearded
   stranger who typed the letter and sent the package, and the
   constabulary are combing the country for any blacks who may have
   carried him. I didn't use many, but if officers question the Ubandes
   who took me through N'Kini jungle belt I'll have more to explain than I
   like. It looks as if the time has come for me to vanish; so tomorrow I
   believe I'll resign and prepare to start for parts unknown. Nov. 9,
   1931--Hard work getting my resignation acted on, but release came
   today. I didn't want to aggravate suspicion by decamping outright. Last
   week I heard from James about Moore's death--but nothing more than is
   in the papers. Those around him in New York seem rather reticent about
   details, though they all talk about a searching investigation. No word
   from any of my friends in the East. Moore must have spread some
   dangerous suspicions around before he lost consciousness--but there
   isn't an iota of proof he could have adduced. Still, I am taking no
   chances. On Thursday I shall start for Mombasa, and when there will
   take a steamer down the coast to Durban. After that I shall drop from
   sight--but soon afterward the mining properties' broker Frederick
   Nasmyth Mason, from Toronto, will turn up in Johannesburg. Let this be
   the end of my journal. If in the end I am not suspected, it will serve
   its original purpose after my death and reveal what would otherwise not
   be known. If, on the other hand, these suspicions do materialise and
   persist, it will confirm and clarify the vague charges, and fill in
   many important and puzzling gaps. Of course, if danger comes my way I
   shall have to destroy it. Well, Moore is dead--as he amply deserves to
   be. Now Dr. Thomas Slauenwite is dead, too. And when the body formerly
   belonging to Thomas Slauenwite is dead, the public may have this
   record.

   II

   Jan. 15, 1932--A new year--and a reluctant reopening of this journal.
   This time I am writing solely to relieve my mind, for it would be
   absurd to fancy that the case is not definitely closed. I am settled in
   the Vaal Hotel, Johannesburg, under my new name, and no one has so far
   challenged my identity. Have had some inconclusive business talks to
   keep up my part as a mine broker, and believe I may actually work
   myself into that business. Later I shall go to Toronto and plant a few
   evidences for my fictitious past. But what is bothering me is an insect
   that invaded my room around noon today. Of course I have had all sorts
   of nightmares about blue flies of late, but those were only to be
   expected in view of my prevailing nervous strain. This thing, however,
   was a waking actuality, and I am utterly at a loss to account for it.
   It buzzed around my bookshelf for fully a quarter of an hour, and
   eluded every attempt to catch or kill it. The queerest thing was its
   colour and aspect--for it had blue wings and was in every way a
   duplicate of my hybrid envoys of death. How it could possibly be one of
   these, in fact, I certainly don't know. I disposed of all the
   hybrids--stained and unstained--that I didn't send to Moore, and can't
   recall any instance of escape. Can this be wholly an hallucination? Or
   could any of the specimens that escaped in Brooklyn when Moore was
   bitten have found their way back to Africa? There was that absurd story
   of the blue fly that waked Dyson when Moore died--but after all, the
   survival and return of some of the things is not impossible. It is
   perfectly plausible that the blue should stick to their wings, too, for
   the pigment I devised was almost as good as tattooing for permanence.
   By elimination, that would seem to be the only rational explanation for
   this thing; though it is very curious that the fellow has come as far
   south as this. Possibly it's some hereditary homing instinct inherent
   in the tsetse strain. After all, that side of him belongs to South
   Africa. I must be on my guard against a bite. Of course the original
   venom--if this is actually one of the flies that escaped from
   Moore--was worn out ages ago; but the fellow must have fed as he flew
   back from America, and he may well have come through Central Africa and
   picked up a fresh infectivity. Indeed, that's more probable than not;
   for the palpalis half of his heredity would naturally take him back to
   Uganda, and all the trypanosomiasis germs. I still have some of the
   tryparsamide left--I couldn't bear to destroy my medicine case,
   incriminating though it may be--but since reading up on the subject I
   am not so sure about the drug's action as I was. It gives one a
   fighting chance--certainly it saved Gamba--but there's always a large
   probability of failure. It's devilish queer that this fly should have
   happened to come into my room--of all places in the wide expanse of
   Africa! Seems to strain coincidence to the breaking-point. I suppose
   that if it comes again, I shall certainly kill it. I'm surprised that
   it escaped me today, for ordinarily these fellows are extremely stupid
   and easy to catch. Can it be a pure illusion after all? Certainly the
   heat is getting me of late as it never did before--even up around
   Uganda. Jan. 16--Am I going insane? The fly came again this noon, and
   acted so anomalously that I can't make head or tail of it. Only
   delusion on my part could account for what that buzzing pest seemed to
   do. It appeared from nowhere, and went straight to my
   bookshelf--circling again and again to front a copy of Moore's Diptera
   of Central and Southern Africa. Now and then it would light on top or
   back of the volume, and occasionally it would dart forward toward me
   and retreat before I could strike at it with a folded paper. Such
   cunning is unheard of among the notoriously stupid African diptera. For
   nearly half an hour I tried to get the cursed thing, but at last it
   darted out the window through a hole in the screen that I hadn't
   noticed. At times I fancied it deliberately mocked me by coming within
   reach of my weapon and then skilfully sidestepping as I struck out. I
   must keep a tight hold of my consciousness. Jan. 17--Either I am mad or
   the world is in the grip of some sudden suspension of the laws of
   probability as we know them. That damnable fly came in from somewhere
   just before noon and commenced buzzing around the copy of Moore's
   Diptera on my shelf. Again I tried to catch it, and again yesterday's
   experience was repeated. Finally the pest made for the open inkwell on
   my table and dipped itself in--just the legs and thorax, keeping its
   wings clear. Then it sailed up to the ceiling and lit--beginning to
   crawl around in a curved patch and leaving a trail of ink. After a time
   it hopped a bit and made a single ink spot unconnected with the
   trail--then it dropped squarely in front of my face, and buzzed out of
   sight before I could get it. Something about this whole business struck
   me as monstrously sinister and abnormal--more so than I could explain
   to myself. When I looked at the ink-trail on the ceiling from different
   angles, it seemed more and more familiar to me, and it dawned on me
   suddenly that it formed an absolutely perfect question-mark. What
   device could be more malignly appropriate? It is a wonder that I did
   not faint. So far the hotel attendants have not noticed it. Have not
   seen the fly this afternoon and evening, but am keeping my inkwell
   securely closed. I think my extermination of Moore must be preying on
   me, and giving me morbid hallucinations. Perhaps there is no fly at
   all. Jan. 18--Into what strange hell of living nightmare am I plunged?
   What occurred today is something which could not normally happen--and
   yet an hotel attendant has seen the marks on the ceiling and concedes
   their reality. About eleven o'clock this morning, as I was writing on a
   manuscript, something darted down to the inkwell for a second and
   flashed aloft again before I could see what it was. Looking up, I saw
   that hellish fly on the ceiling as it had been before--crawling along
   and tracing another trail of curves and turns. There was nothing I
   could do, but I folded a newspaper in readiness to get the creature if
   it should fly near enough. When it had made several turns on the
   ceiling it flew into a dark corner and disappeared, and as I looked
   upward at the doubly defaced plastering I saw that the new ink-trail
   was that of a huge and unmistakable figure 5! For a time I was almost
   unconscious from a wave of nameless menace for which I could not fully
   account. Then I summoned up my resolution and took an active step.
   Going out to a chemist's shop I purchased some gum and other things
   necessary for preparing a sticky trap--also a duplicate inkwell.
   Returning to my room, I filled the new inkwell with the sticky mixture
   and set it where the old one had been, leaving it open. Then I tried to
   concentrate my mind on some reading. About three o'clock I heard the
   accursed insect again, and saw it circling around the new inkwell. It
   descended to the sticky surface but did not touch it, and afterward
   sailed straight toward me--retreating before I could hit it. Then it
   went to the bookshelf and circled around Moore's treatise. There is
   something profound and diabolic about the way the intruder hovers near
   that book. The worst part was the last. Leaving Moore's book, the
   insect flew over to the open window and began beating itself
   rhythmically against the wire screen. There would be a series of beats
   and then a series of equal length and another pause, and so on.
   Something about this performance held me motionless for a couple of
   moments, but after that I went over to the window and tried to kill the
   noxious thing. As usual, no use. It merely flew across the room to a
   lamp and began beating the same tattoo on the stiff cardboard shade. I
   felt a vague desperation, and proceeded to shut all the doors as well
   as the window whose screen had the imperceptible hole. It seemed very
   necessary to kill this persistent being, whose hounding was rapidly
   unseating my mind. Then, unconsciously counting, I began to notice that
   each of its series of beatings contained just five strokes. Five--the
   same number that the thing had traced in ink on the ceiling in the
   morning! Could there be any conceivable connexion? The notion was
   maniacal, for that would argue a human intellect and a knowledge of
   written figures in the hybrid fly. A human intellect--did not that take
   one back to the most primitive legends of the Uganda blacks? And yet
   there was that infernal cleverness in eluding me as contrasted with the
   normal stupidity of the breed. As I laid aside my folded paper and sat
   down in growing horror, the insect buzzed aloft and disappeared through
   a hole in the ceiling where the radiator pipe went to the room above.
   The departure did not soothe me, for my mind had started on a train of
   wild and terrible reflections. If this fly had a human intelligence,
   where did that intelligence come from? Was there any truth in the
   native notion that these creatures acquire the personality of their
   victims after the latter's death? If so, whose personality did this fly
   bear? I had reasoned out that it must be one of those which escaped
   from Moore at the time he was bitten. Was this the envoy of death which
   had bitten Moore? If so, what did it want with me? What did it want
   with me anyway? In a cold perspiration I remembered the actions of the
   fly that had bitten Batta when Batta died. Had its own personality been
   displaced by that of its dead victim? Then there was that sensational
   news account of the fly that waked Dyson when Moore died. As for that
   fly that was hounding me--could it be that a vindictive human
   personality drove it on? How it hovered around Moore's book!--I refused
   to think any farther than that. All at once I began to feel sure that
   the creature was indeed infected, and in the most virulent way. With a
   malign deliberation so evident in every act, it must surely have
   charged itself on purpose with the deadliest bacilli in all Africa. My
   mind, thoroughly shaken, was now taking the thing's human qualities for
   granted. I now telephoned the clerk and asked for a man to stop up the
   radiator pipehole and other possible chinks in my room. I spoke of
   being tormented by flies, and he seemed to be quite sympathetic. When
   the man came, I shewed him the ink-marks on the ceiling, which he
   recognised without difficulty. So they are real! The resemblance to a
   question-mark and a figure 5 puzzled and fascinated him. In the end he
   stopped up all the holes he could find, and mended the window-screen,
   so that I can now keep both windows open. He evidently thought me a bit
   eccentric, especially since no insects were in sight while he was here.
   But I am past minding that. So far the fly has not appeared this
   evening. God knows what it is, what it wants, or what will become of
   me! Jan. 19--I am utterly engulfed in horror. The thing has touched me.
   Something monstrous and daemoniac is at work around me, and I am a
   helpless victim. In the morning, when I returned from breakfast, that
   winged fiend from hell brushed into the room over my head, and began
   beating itself against the window-screen as it did yesterday. This
   time, though, each series of beats contained only four strokes. I
   rushed to the window and tried to catch it, but it escaped as usual and
   flew over to Moore's treatise, where it buzzed around mockingly. Its
   vocal equipment is limited, but I noticed that its spells of buzzing
   came in groups of four. By this time I was certainly mad, for I called
   out to it, "Moore, Moore, for God's sake, what do you want?" When I did
   so, the creature suddenly ceased its circling, flew toward me, and made
   a low, graceful dip in the air, somehow suggestive of a bow. Then it
   flew back to the book. At least, I seemed to see it do all this--though
   I am trusting my senses no longer. And then the worst thing happened. I
   had left my door open, hoping the monster would leave if I could not
   catch it; but about 11:30 I shut the door, concluding it had gone. Then
   I settled down to read. Just at noon I felt a tickling on the back of
   my neck, but when I put my hand up nothing was there. In a moment I
   felt the tickling again--and before I could move, that nameless spawn
   of hell sailed into view from behind, did another of those mocking,
   graceful dips in the air, and flew out through the keyhole--which I had
   never dreamed was large enough to allow its passage. That the thing had
   touched me, I could not doubt. It had touched me without injuring
   me--and then I remembered in a sudden cold fright that Moore had been
   bitten on the back of the neck at noon. No invasion since then--but I
   have stuffed all the keyholes with paper and shall have a folded paper
   ready for use whenever I open the door to leave or enter. Jan. 20--I
   cannot yet believe fully in the supernatural, yet I fear none the less
   that I am lost. The business is too much for me. Just before noon today
   that devil appeared outside the window and repeated its beating
   operations; but this time in series of three. When I went to the window
   it flew off out of sight. I still have resolution enough to take one
   more defensive step. Removing both window-screens, I coated them with
   my sticky preparation--the one I used in the inkwell--outside and
   inside, and set them back in place. If that creature attempts another
   tattoo, it will be its last! Rest of the day in peace. Can I weather
   this experience without becoming a maniac? Jan. 21--On board train for
   Bloemfontein. I am routed. The thing is winning. It has a diabolic
   intelligence against which all my devices are powerless. It appeared
   outside the window this morning, but did not touch the sticky screen.
   Instead, it sheered off without lighting and began buzzing around in
   circles--two at a time, followed by a pause in the air. After several
   of these performances it flew off out of sight over the roofs of the
   city. My nerves are just about at the breaking-point, for these
   suggestions of numbers are capable of a hideous interpretation. Monday
   the thing dwelt on the figure five; Tuesday it was four; Wednesday it
   was three; and now today it is two. Five, four, three, two--what can
   this be save some monstrous and unthinkable counting-off of days? For
   what purpose, only the evil powers of the universe can know. I spent
   all the afternoon packing and arranging about my trunks, and now I have
   taken the night express for Bloemfontein. Flight may be useless, but
   what else can one do? Jan. 22--Settled at the Orange Hotel,
   Bloemfontein--a comfortable and excellent place--but the horror
   followed me. I had shut all the doors and windows, stopped all the
   keyholes, looked for any possible chinks, and pulled down all the
   shades--but just before noon I heard a dull tap on one of the
   window-screens. I waited--and after a long pause another tap came. A
   second pause, and still another single tap. Raising the shade, I saw
   that accursed fly, as I had expected. It described one large, slow
   circle in the air, and then flew out of sight. I was left as weak as a
   rag, and had to rest on the couch. One! This was clearly the burden of
   the monster's present message. One tap, one circle. Did this mean one
   more day for me before some unthinkable doom? Ought I to flee again, or
   entrench myself here by sealing up the room? After an hour's rest I
   felt able to act, and ordered a large reserve supply of canned and
   packaged food--also linen and towels--sent in. Tomorrow I shall not
   under any circumstances open any crevice of door or window. When the
   food and linen came the black looked at me queerly, but I no longer
   care how eccentric--or insane--I may appear. I am hounded by powers
   worse than the ridicule of mankind. Having received my supplies, I went
   over every square millimeter of the walls, and stopped up every
   microscopic opening I could find. At last I feel able to get real
   sleep. (Handwriting here becomes irregular, nervous, and very difficult
   to decipher) Jan. 23--It is just before noon, and I feel that something
   very terrible is about to happen. Didn't sleep as late as I expected,
   even though I got almost no sleep on the train the night before. Up
   early, and have had trouble getting concentrated on anything--reading
   or writing. That slow, deliberate counting-off of days is too much for
   me. I don't know which has gone wild--Nature or my head. Until about
   eleven I did very little except walk up and down the room. Then I heard
   a rustle among the food packages brought in yesterday, and that
   daemoniac fly crawled out before my eyes. I grabbed something flat and
   made passes at the thing despite my panic fear, but with no more effect
   than usual. As I advanced, that blue-winged horror retreated as usual
   to the table where I had piled my books, and lit for a second on
   Moore's Diptera of Central and Southern Africa. Then as I followed, it
   flew over to the mantel clock and lit on the dial near the figure 12.
   Before I could think up another move it had begun to crawl around the
   dial very slowly and deliberately--in the direction of the hands. It
   passed under the minute hand, curved down and up, passed under the hour
   hand, and finally came to a stop exactly at the figure 12. As it
   hovered there it fluttered its wings with a buzzing noise. Is this a
   portent of some sort? I am getting as superstitious as the blacks. The
   hour is now a little after eleven. Is twelve the end? I have just one
   last resort, brought to my mind through utter desperation. Wish I had
   thought of it before. Recalling that my medicine case contains both of
   the substances necessary to generate chlorine gas, I have resolved to
   fill the room with that lethal vapour--asphyxiating the fly while
   protecting myself with an ammonia-sealed handkerchief tied over my
   face. Fortunately I have a good supply of ammonia. This crude mask will
   probably neutralise the acrid chlorine fumes till the insect is
   dead--or at least helpless enough to crush. But I must be quick. How
   can I be sure that the thing will not suddenly dart for me before my
   preparations are complete? I ought not to be stopping to write in this
   journal. Later--Both chemicals--hydrochloric acid and manganese
   dioxide--on the table all ready to mix. I've tied the handkerchief over
   my nose and mouth, and have a bottle of ammonia ready to keep it soaked
   until the chlorine is gone. Have battened down both windows. But I
   don't like the actions of that hybrid daemon. It stays on the clock,
   but is very slowly crawling around backward from the 12 mark to meet
   the gradually advancing minute-hand. Is this to be my last entry in
   this journal? It would be useless to try to deny what I suspect. Too
   often a grain of incredible truth lurks behind the wildest and most
   fantastic of legends. Is the personality of Henry Moore trying to get
   at me through this blue-winged devil? Is this the fly that bit him, and
   that in consequence absorbed his consciousness when he died? If so, and
   if it bites me, will my own personality displace Moore's and enter that
   buzzing body when I die of the bite later on? Perhaps, though, I need
   not die even if it gets me. There is always a chance with tryparsamide.
   And I regret nothing. Moore had to die, be the outcome what it will.
   Slightly later. The fly has paused on the clock-dial near the 45-minute
   mark. It is now 11:30. I am saturating the handkerchief over my face
   with ammonia, and keeping the bottle handy for further applications.
   This will be the final entry before I mix the acid and manganese and
   liberate the chlorine. I ought not to be losing time, but it steadies
   me to get things down on paper. But for this record, I'd have lost all
   my reason long ago. The fly seems to be getting restless, and the
   minute-hand is approaching it. Now for the chlorine. . . .

   (End of the journal)

   On Sunday, Jan. 24, 1932, after repeated knocking had failed to gain
   any response from the eccentric man in Room 303 of the Orange Hotel, a
   black attendant entered with a pass key and at once fled shrieking
   downstairs to tell the clerk what he had found. The clerk, after
   notifying the police, summoned the manager; and the latter accompanied
   Constable De Witt, Coroner Bogaert, and Dr. Van Keulen to the fatal
   room. The occupant lay dead on the floor--his face upward, and bound
   with a handkerchief which smelled strongly of ammonia. Under this
   covering the features shewed an expression of stark, utter fear which
   transmitted itself to the observers On the back of the neck Dr. Van
   Keulen found a virulent insect bite--dark red, with a purple ring
   around it--which suggested a tsetse-fly or something less innocuous. An
   examination indicated that death must be due to heart-failure induced
   by sheer fright rather than to the bite--though a subsequent autopsy
   indicated that the germ of trypanosomiasis had been introduced into the
   system. On the table were several objects--a worn leather blank-book
   containing the journal just described, a pen, writing-pad, and open
   inkwell, a doctor's medicine case with the initials "T. S." marked in
   gold, bottles of ammonia and hydrochloric acid, and a tumbler about a
   quarter full of black manganese dioxide. The ammonia bottle demanded a
   second look because something besides the fluid seemed to be in it.
   Looking closer, Coroner Bogaert saw that the alien occupant was a fly.
   It seemed to be some sort of hybrid with vague tsetse affiliations, but
   its wings--shewing faintly blue despite the action of the strong
   ammonia--were a complete puzzle. Something about it waked a faint
   memory of newspaper reading in Dr. Van Keulen--a memory which the
   journal was soon to confirm. Its lower parts seemed to have been
   stained with ink, so thoroughly that even the ammonia had not bleached
   them. Possibly it had fallen at one time into the inkwell, though the
   wings were untouched. But how had it managed to fall into the
   narrow-necked ammonia bottle? It was as if the creature had
   deliberately crawled in and committed suicide! But the strangest thing
   of all was what Constable De Witt noticed on the smooth white ceiling
   overhead as his eyes roved about curiously. At his cry the other three
   followed his gaze--even Dr. Van Keulen, who had for some time been
   thumbing through the worn leather book with an expression of mixed
   horror, fascination, and incredulity. The thing on the ceiling was a
   series of shaky, straggling ink-tracks, such as might have been made by
   the crawling of some ink-drenched insect. At once everyone thought of
   the stains on the fly so oddly found in the ammonia bottle. But these
   were no ordinary ink-tracks. Even a first glance revealed something
   hauntingly familiar about them, and closer inspection brought gasps of
   startled wonder from all four observers. Coroner Bogaert instinctively
   looked around the room to see if there were any conceivable instrument
   or arrangement of piled-up furniture which could make it possible for
   those straggling marks to have been drawn by human agency. Finding
   nothing of the sort, he resumed his curious and almost awestruck upward
   glance. For beyond a doubt these inky smudges formed definite letters
   of the alphabet--letters coherently arranged in English words. The
   doctor was the first to make them out clearly, and the others listened
   breathlessly as he recited the insane-sounding message so incredibly
   scrawled in a place no human hand could reach:
   "SEE MY JOURNAL--IT GOT ME FIRST--I DIED--THEN I SAW I WAS IN IT--THE BLACKS
ARE RIGHT--STRANGE POWERS IN NATURE--NOW I WILL DROWN WHAT IS LEFT--"

   Presently, amidst the puzzled hush that followed, Dr. Van Keulen
   commenced reading aloud from the worn leather journal.
