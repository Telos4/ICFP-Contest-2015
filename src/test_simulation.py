interpretation and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier. from my experience i cannot doubt but that man when lost to terrestrial consciousness is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking. from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much yet prove little. we may guess that in dreams life matter and vitality as the earth knows such things are not necessarily constant and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them. sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon.\n', u'metrical regularity \n', u'being',

threaten the very integrity of the universe. all this reflection was no doubt morbid but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as
