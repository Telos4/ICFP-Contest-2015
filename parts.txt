Identifyable parts of a solution:

- JSON parser and generator

- tetris engine on hexagons:
-- the way tetris does it usually
-- hexagons: fitting data structure?

- crypto: analyse linear congruental generator for pseudo-random
-- solvers? compute power?
-- use prediction for benefits in game

- output commands: combine to obtain words of power
-- combination/dictionary attack? do not change the solution
-- find out words of power from Lovecraft
-- obtain *better* words of power through modifying the solution to a similar one

- build system and submission communication
