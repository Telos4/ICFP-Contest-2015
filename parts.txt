Language: Python

Identifyable parts of a solution:

- JSON parser and generator

- tetris engine on hexagons:
-- the way tetris does it usually
-- hexagons: fitting data structure?

- units
-- units can lock: with a wrong command
-- unit can rotate with "pivot point"
-- unit is not necessarily a connected set of cells
-- units may not return to their old position (force this in the board representation!)
-- units are not created by us, but we can find out their order through lcg milking

- crypto: analyse linear congruental generator (lcd) for pseudo-random
-- solvers? compute power?
-- use prediction for benefits in game

- output commands: combine to obtain words of power
-- combination/dictionary attack? do not change the solution
-- find out words of power from Lovecraft
-- obtain *better* words of power through modifying the solution to a similar one

- build system and submission communication

- own jury system?
